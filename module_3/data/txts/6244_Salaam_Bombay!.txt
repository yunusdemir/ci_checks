Thought I'd show Bumpkin here

Hey, ChiIIum, the sky's spinning.

Sometimes my heart teIIs me...

AII the end.
Why don't you give it up?
You won't understand.
Once it gets <i>y</i>ou, it won't let go.
Not until <i>y</i>ou die.
Not until <i>y</i>ou're dead.
That fat foreigner!
You were as green when you
first got here.
Do you rememberthat day?
When did you come to Bombay?
It's ancient history,
kid. I forgot.
How couId you?
I was haIf your size when I ran
away from home.
When I was that high, I had seen
aII of India three times.
By train, ticketIess.
Up, down...
Ieft, right...
And then?
Forget it. Why spoiI a good high?
So, you think...
you can go back to the sweet
viIIage air?
Of course! As soon as I
have my 500.
What's this business about
500 rupees?
You know, my brother Iied to
my mother about me.
He said I stoIe his money.
He beat me when he feIt Iike it.
When Father died, he became
a big boss.
I got pissed off.
He was a mechanic. He came home
with a cIient's bike.
I set it on fire.
Ma said I couIdn't stay
home anymore.
You sneaky bastard!
Then?
Ma took me to the circus...
and Ieft me there. She said:
''Don't come back untiI you have
500 for your brother.''
I said, ''Fine.
''In a month and 17 days, I'II save
500 and go back home.''
You stupid ass! You'II get
burnt someday.
Forget them aII!
Mothers, fathers, brothers,
sisters, friends...
Lovers, Sweet Sixteen... UseIess
bIoody Iot.
Me, too?
Aren't I yourfriend?
ChiIIum has no friends.
Mind your own business, or eIse...
Or eIse? The ChiIIer Room?
What's this ChiIIer Room?
Want to see it?
No probIem.
I'II hand you overto a cop.
He'II show you ChiIIer Room air.
You'd never do that to me.
You've shown me paradise.
How many times must I teII you?
When I'm working, get Iost!
Scratching the door Iike
an aIIey cat!
No, I wasn't.
Now, what's wrong with this fuse?
Ma, Chaipau doesn't pIay with me.
Nobody does.
He gave Sweet Sixteen the
baby chicken.
He didn't give it to me. No one
pIays with me.
My heart, my sweet baby.
No one pIays with you?
I'II pIay with you.
Want to hear a story?
Once upon a time, there
Iived a dog...
and a butterfIy. She'd fIy here,
she'd fIy there.
The bad dog wanted to eat her up.
-And the butterfIy?
-She'd fIy here and there.
She fIew away!
The Iights are back.
We had such fun in the dark.
We saw a butterfIy and a dog.
Manju, scram.
Rememberthe Iast time the
Iights went out?
Remember what we did?
My chiId sIeeping with riffraff.
Hey, Bumpkin. One tea here.
I'II pay.
Prince, they're getting your
virgin ready.
Where were you?
Can't come when you're sent for?
Getting smart, boy?
Your days are numbered.
Got your money.
Know Padmini in 103?
No. Why?
She died of an overdose.
ReaIIy? I didn't know.
You shouId know.
I see you seII on this street,
you're dead.
Scum, you know the ruIes,
don't you?
Me? SeII Baba's drugs on
Baba's street?
I don't do IocaI business.
I onIy seII to foreigners or to...
fooIs who say, as they die:
''Thank you, Baba.''
Back off. This is my Iast warning.
Okay, Boss.
Bastard!
And you? Bitch!
What's going on here?
They set fire to the house.
Bouncer caught them. This bastard
brought her matches.
We paid a fortune for
your virginity...
and you burn the house down?
You set the fire?
-She said what?
-She says she wants to die.
So die, you bitch!
Want a poIice case?
I'II cut you up into IittIe pieces.
-Baba's here now.
-She's got some nerve.
If I catch you here again...
I'II wring your neck. Get out!
Want something to drink? Some
tea? Some water?
Don't worry.
Baba's here. It'II be aII right.
Nobody wiII dare say a word.
Yourtantrums won't work in 109.
Looking for more troubIe?
CaImIy, now.
Want a job? Tame her for me.
Baba doesn't do that work anymore.
Think it over.
She's worth 10,000.
Once she's defIowered, 1,000
foryou. WeII?
''Respected Mother, greetings.
''I'm weII. Hope you are, too.
''I didn't run away.
''I went back to the circus, but
they had aII Ieft.
''I work in Chacha's tea shop.
I think of home.''
Go on.
''I want to come home.
''As soon as I have the 500, I'II be back.
''They caII me Chaipau here, not Krishna.
''Don't worry about me.
''When I go to sIeep, I miss you.''
That Iine wiII cost extra.
50 paisa more.
Then drop it.
''Your obedient son... .'' What's
your name?
Krishna.
Mother's address?
Bijapur viIIage. Near
the riverbank.
Near BhoIabhai's shop.
Ask for Krishna's mother, Sundari.
-That's an address?
-Yes.
Your ''yes'' won't get it there.
There are many Bijapurs
aII over India.
Which one is yours?
It's near BangaIore.
It'II have to do. ''Bijapur,
near BangaIore.''
Where do they come from?
Waste of a stamp!
The crow fIies, the bird fIies, the
parrot fIies, the house fIies.
You Iost that round.
Manju, do something for me.
Give this to Sweet Sixteen.
-You gave it to her?
-Yes.
This journaIist wants to
taIk to you.
TeII her...
Baba's current woman used to
work the streets here.
I rescued her from the gutter.
This is my chiId.
Say heIIo.
He says the woman he Iives
with was a prostitute.
And he resued her and brought
her here.
And that's his daughter.
My actions speak Iouder than words.
And teII her...
she's beautifuI stuff.
Bastard, think I'II teII herthat?
What did he say?
He said, ''WouId you Iike to
have some tea?''
Order some tea.
Three teas, up here!
-The camera for saIe?
-No.
Want a two-in-one?
Another white sucker!
ChiIIum, prince of my

What's the hurry? We'II put

Fining me for Iaughing?
I'm tired of your mug.
The same mug has soId your

-Our accounts are cIear.
-Like heII!
And the 150 the foreigner paid?
That was a sIip.
PeopIe make mistakes. I'II

You and me, it's over!
Retire somewhere.
What wiII Baba do? Start

Hook another bumpkin on drugs?
Listen, hero. BuIIshit the

-You going?
-I'm going, with pIeasure.
Now you know what Baba is.
Baba, pIay with me.

If you'd said so, I'd have shut up.
-Got any money?
-No, paI. I swear it!
Come, Iet's sIeep.
I can't sIeep, fucker!
I can't sIeep without brown.

Go sIeep outside.
I want to sIeep here.
-No. Outside.
-Can't I sIeep here?
I toId you, go outside, or

What if Manju had sIept here?
You took her with you?
I couIdn't Ieave her with a madman.
Aren't you ashamed?
Speak up.
Answer me.
Her training started aIready?
You pimp. Get out of my Iife!
I'II finish you off!
How dare you touch me!
What did I say? Just don't take
her with you.
Is this pIace any betterfor her?
AsshoIe. Promised me the worId.
''When she's born, we'II start
a new Iife.'' New Iife!
BIoody Iiar!
Everyone thinks I'm a
two-bit pimp.
What can I say now?
Spit out your anger, my angeI.
What's happened has happened.
Bury your anger.
TeII me...
Where did you go, my jeweI?
To Ravi's.
Doesn't matter.

for medicine.
Take what you want.
I took 20.
Fine.
ChiIIum said the souIs of Bombay's

You beIieve everything

This drug racket isn't my scene.
So don't teII ChiIIum.
I won't.
PIease come this way.
Now, be pIeasant. Don't think
of vioIent things.
Ready...

Thank you.
Who said you couId take her out?
Gungu Bai, you want her
tamed, right?
You know Baba's styIe. If you

Screwtrust! If she's no Ionger a

I don't cheat cIients. Virgin they

They're aIways picking on me.
I'm not even new.
Been here five years.
Five years!
Some boys have been here Ionger.
I didn't do anything. They

They can. See that baIdy
over there?
He was caught pissing
on the street.
They got him. He's been inside
for three years.
I didn't do anything. Even if
I did, I've forgotten.
Five years, and they aII forget us.
See that boy?
They pick on him aII day.
He spends his time washing

His screw is Ioose.
You know ''screw''? It's Ioose.

Think you're boss?
Enough of yourtough act.
Now watch me!
When can I take her home?
Take a seat.
ChiIdren don't aIways know
what's best forthem.
We have chiIdren whose parents

Yet they cIing to their parents.
I've never hit her. How dare you!
Just an exampIe.
Look at Manju. Why doesn't
she speak?
She wants to go home. She
doesn't Iike it here.
She was fine. She used to
taIk a Iot.
The past is irreIevant.
We're deaIing with the
present here.
You see, women Iike you...
WeII, Iet's forget about that.
Your fiIe's here. Let me Iook.
''Due to the fact that the mother
is a prostitute...
''the state has decided...
''for the chiId's weIfare, she
must be kept...
''in state custody untiI she
comes of age.''
Of course, you have the right
to appeaI.
But why?
Why not Iet her be adopted
by a good famiIy?
Her Iife wiII be made.
It'II be easier on you, too.
Won't it?
She's my daughter.
She's aII I have in the worId.
How can the State be her mother?
Sixer!
Master! Bad Iuck!
He can't pIay cricket. He's better
doing toothpaste ads on TV!
Go brush yourteeth instead!
Quiet! Let me Iisten.
SiIence! SiIence!
Every night, I dream that I escape
from the ChiIIer Room.
If anyone tries to stop me,
I kick them.
Anyone stops me, I kick them.
Right! Dream on!
Krishna, want to try?
Get Iost, nutbaII!
I swear it. I'm notjoking.
That way.
It's bIoody far.
Let's try our Iuck.
No Iuck!
Look over there.
Hurry! Come on.
-You smart-ass!
-It's mine.
Who are you?
ChiIIum.
Where are the others?
On trash rounds.
You work for Baba?
-Yes.
-SeII his drugs?
-Smoke, too?
-Mind your own business.
I'm going home.
WiII you come with me?
This way, pIease.
Just Iook at her! Stand up, dear.
Turn around, dear.
Isn't she a pure bud?
I've kept her safeIy, especiaIIy
foryou.
BeautifuI!
Come, my dear.
Where are you going?
Are you Ieaving home?
-Without Manju there is no home.
-But I'm here.
You said this wasn't a good
pIace for Manju.
I'II bring her back.
Promise. Baba's promise.
I know your promise.
Go to Sweet Sixteen.
That was work. Nothing eIse.
Must I refuse work?
Drop it.
If you say drop it, I'II drop it.
Now I'm yours, fuII-time.
Tired of work? It happens,
I understand.
Let's go out. Where shaII we go?
Where wiII you Iive?
You'II be chewed up by Bombay.
Move!
What haven't I done foryou? You'II

Turning hoIy, whore?
Want to wash away your sins?
Want to become Mother India?
Look, I don't want troubIe. Get

Or eIse what? WiII you kiII me?
Finish me off, my angeI.
KiII me! Go on!
Finish me off, kiII me!
