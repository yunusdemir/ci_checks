"Happy birthday, dear Chelsea
"Happy birthday to you"
- Happy birthday.
- Good night.
Chelsea!
Chelsea, come on. We have no time.
My painting! Where's my painting?
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
Bob, get the hell out of there!
Jesus!
<i>This was the scene 18 years ago...</i>
<i>... as millions of dollars worth
of Deardon paintings went up in smoke.</i>
<i>Deardon perished in the flames.</i>
<i>Surviving the inferno was
his 8-year-old daughter, Chelsea.</i>
<i>Last night,
that same Chelsea Deardon, now 26...</i>
<i>... was arrested for attempting to steal
one of her father's valuable paintings...</i>
<i>... from Robert Forrester's
Manhattan penthouse. Police...</i>
I was watching that.
Sorry! The news is so boring.
Did you do your homework?
I'm just finishing it.
Your mother always tells me
to make sure you do it.
You tell me you have no homework.
Why is that?
I only have to write one paragraph
on an emotion. It's easy.
Easy? You think things are easy?
- Can we go out for breakfast?
- No, we can't. We ate out last night.
When you stay with me, we're a family.
We eat in...
...occasionally.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
You didn't sleep again, did you?
- You didn't sleep again.
- I slept.
I woke up and I heard
these strange sounds.
And...
Were you dancing in the bathroom?
Dancing in the bathroom?
Mom says whenever you can't sleep,
you tap dance in the bathroom.
Do you believe that?
So I danced once or twice,
but I don't tap dance.
Dad!
Get back. I can handle it.
Got it.
Don't tell Mom about the toast.
See you in a few days.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Tom.
- You're going to court.
- Court?
Howard Marchek,
receiving stolen property.
Slumber party?
- Marcheck is Henning's case.
- Yours now. He has laryngitis.
Tom, thanks.
You were right about the landlady.
Put her on the bench,
she cracked like an egg.
I cracked her like a walnut.
She crumbled like blue cheese.
- He should open a restaurant.
- How'd you get oatmeal on your shirt?
Do me a favor, will you?
Help me with this shirt.
Great.
I hate to break up your aerobics class,
but this is important.
- What is it, Blanchard?
- Logan, I need that 750 form.
- Of course you do. What is it?
- 750?
The monthly composite
of trials and verdicts.
- Do you have it?
- No. No, I don't.
- Okay.
- I filed an 822 instead.
I know every form in every division
of the DA's office.
I assure you there's no 822,
and I do know that.
You got me.
I'd like to see this form, 750,
on my desk by the end of the day.
- You've got lunch with the chief today.
- I know. 12:30, his office.
1:00 at Le Zinc.
Right, 1:00. Le Zinc.
- Marchek, who's the defense on that case?
- Laura J. Kelly.
She once tried putting a dog
on the witness stand.
Under oath?
Mr. Marchek is a beloved member
of a very large, tight-knit family.
We've brought forth two dozen cousins,
aunts, uncles, in-laws...
...each of whom has testified under oath
that the alleged stolen property...
...was given to Mr. Marchek
as birthday gifts by them.
Fourteen of them chose to give him
a television set.
An unlikely coincidence?
Under normal circumstances, perhaps.
But we all heard Mr. Marchek's
sworn testimony...
...that all he wanted was a media room...
...not unlike that of
the President of the United States.
The prosecution has made
a big issue out of the fact...
...that none of these relatives could
produce a receipt for the merchandise.
A lovely watch. Do you have a receipt?
No.
- Clerk, arrest this man.
- Objection your honor.
Defense is fondling a juror.
Sustained.
You're not a thief.
Neither is Howard Marchek.
Receipts come, and receipts go.
He did what any compassionate human
would've done in a situation like this.
He offered a fellow citizen a fair deal.
Are we to reward that kindness
with a jail term?
For all our sakes, I hope not.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
please look into your hearts...
...place yourselves in
Mr. Marchek's position...
...and return a verdict of "not guilty."
Thank you.
Before I begin my closing remarks,
I'd like to congratulate Miss Kelly...
...on a defense which was
so entertaining and imaginative.
I must confess,
I didn't know whether to refute it...
...or give it a round of applause.
But we're not in a theater here.
We're in a court of law.
And in court we have
to deal with the facts.
The defense says this was a birthday party.
We've all been to birthday parties.
We've had our share of birthday presents.
But all known generosity pales
when compared to the attention...
...lavished on Mr. Marchek
by his adoring relatives.
This must have been some birthday party.
Detectives said they found TV sets,
stereos, microwaves, typewriters.
Not the kind of variety you find at Sears...
...but definitely selling
at much better prices.
What about the Obitser arraignment?
- I'll set the date.
- Mr. Logan.
Twenty-seven relatives, birthday presents.
Were you serious?
It was all I had.
It was the best possible defense.
It should've never gone to court.
You should have pleaded guilty.
Think of it this way: Every person,
guilty or innocent, deserves a defense.
- It's in the Constitution.
- Why are you following me?
I'd like you to talk to my client,
Chelsea Deardon.
Chelsea Deardon.
I plan to talk to her, in court.
I'm not talking about court.
There are special circumstances
in the case. I'd like to brief you...
If the evidence is compelling enough,
I'm sure the jury will agree. Excuse me.
I'm trying to prevent
a miscarriage of justice.
I'm talking about evidence
a jury may never have a chance to hear.
You have a reputation for fairness.
- Chelsea Deardon's a client I can believe in.
- Like Howard Marchek?
That's it?
- That's the entire extent of your curiosity?
- On the contrary.
Twenty-seven relatives, a talking dog?
I can't wait to see what's next.
See you in court.
Clients of yours?
You got to get that done this afternoon.
Got it. Right.
Tom.
Tom.
You got a handkerchief?
You got a handkerchief?
Yeah, sure. God.
That is my table. I sit there every day.
I'm sorry.
- Tom, I need your legal opinion.
- Not now, I need to see Bowers.
My client slams his truck
through the window of a 7-Eleven.
He breaks a customer's leg,
bangs up the clerk with bruises.
You got a problem.
Okay look, my client is driving,
but he is also with a woman...
...who's resting her head in his lap actively.
What are you talking about?
Speak English, Ed.
Resting her head with affection.
This breaks his concentration
on driving, and...
I can build a case on this.
Ultimately, the accident is her fault
and not his.
- What do you think?
- I'd sell the screen rights.
A drink for you, sir?
- Yeah. No.
- You're late. Cause me stress.
Doctor says I'm supposed to
cut down on stress.
These pills kill the acid in the coffee...
...before the acid in the coffee kills me.
Now let's get to the point here.
You know, Tom,
I always had the highest regard for you...
...both as a lawyer and a human being.
I appreciate that.
That's why I picked you to give the keynote
at the banquet tonight.
Every year some poor son of a bitch
has to get in front of the crowd...
...and spout comforting nonsense.
This year, I want to hear it
from someone with style and charm.
I want to hear it from someone
who's my choice...
...for the next district attorney.
You.
Me?
<i>This is finally it, folks,
my last year as your district attorney.</i>
<i>Too late.</i>
<i>Appeal denied.</i>
<i>Now then, the big question is
who'll replace me?</i>
<i>Well, perhaps someone
like our keynote speaker here.</i>
<i>For the past 12 years, I've given this man...</i>
<i>... the toughest assignments
and the heaviest case loads...</i>
<i>... for one simple reason:
He gets thejob done!</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
<i>... a man whose past performance...</i>
<i>... guarantees him a brilliant future,
Tom Logan.</i>
Chelsea, wait.
Let's do something.
I think this is better.
Yeah. Much better.
<i>An attorney has to know the truth.</i>
<i>Whether he attacks it or defends it...</i>
<i>... the truth is the touchstone of his trade.</i>
<i>That's tricky, because clients often lie.</i>
<i>I don't know what it is about us, but...</i>
<i>... it seems to be human nature,
to lie to a lawyer.</i>
That him?
<i>If your client was 5 miles away
from the crime scene...</i>
<i>... he'd tell you he was 10 miles away.</i>
<i>Nobody seems to trust a lawyer enough
to tell the truth.</i>
<i>Because we are...</i>
<i>... what we are...</i>
<i>... and tend to...</i>
<i>Because people lie so often to lawyers...</i>
<i>... prosecuting attorneys
have to develop that instinct...</i>
<i>... when it comes to determining the truth...</i>
<i>... even when it turns out to be
against his best interests.</i>
<i>He has to expose the truth.</i>
<i>Now, that'sjustice.</i>
<i>And that's why I'm an attorney.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
We'll back you all the way.
Kelly wants to file a cross-complaint
on the Deardon case. I told her no.
She's threatened
to call a press conference.
- What did you tell her?
- That you'd examine the cross-complaint.
A quick investigation.
We don't need this kind of press.
- I won't do it.
- Come on, Chelsea.
<i>Moments ago, Laura J. Kelly,
a Manhattan attorney...</i>
<i>... told us she plans to file charges
against the DA's office.</i>
<i>Miss Kelly, can you tell us
what this is about?</i>
<i>First, I'd like to apologize
for my conduct this evening.</i>
She's doing it. She's doing it.
<i>This young lady, Chelsea Deardon...</i>
<i>... has been victimized
by some very unscrupulous people.</i>
<i>We've tried to get cooperation
from the DA's office...</i>
<i>... but they've been stonewalling us.</i>
<i>We have no choice
but to file a cross-complaint against them.</i>
<i>Here is Tom Logan
from the district attorney's office.</i>
<i>What can you tell us about this?</i>
<i>This is a total surprise to me.
I can assure you that...</i>
<i>... if there's any implication of impropriety
on the part of our office...</i>
<i>... why, it's unfounded.</i>
<i>And I'll personally take charge
of this case from now on.</i>
<i>I had no doubt that when a man
of Tom Logan's character and reputation...</i>
<i>... found out about
the predicament of my client...</i>
<i>... he would take quick and decisive action.
Thank you so much.</i>
For the record
and so there's no misunderstandings...
...you're entitled to remain silent.
Anything you say
can and will be held against you.
- Another attorney can be provided.
- No, I like her.
Did you steal the painting?
- No.
- Yes.
Yes, but no.
- Which is it?
- Both.
This is a waste of time. I can feel it.
I did try to take the painting,
but it already belonged to me.
Can you prove that?
My father gave me that painting
when I was eight.
He even dedicated it to me
on the back in writing. Just look.
Is there any other proof
that the painting belonged to you?
My father kept a journal.
You never told me about that.
There were sketches
of that painting in the journal.
On one he wrote
"For Chelsea's eighth birthday."
I'd like to see the journal.
It's in my apartment.
You can come by any time.
I'll be up there soon.
Who did you steal it from?
She didn't.
She allegedly stole the painting.
From Robert Forrester, major developer.
What were you doing at his place?
His wife throws parties for young artists.
That way people think she knows art.
She's bored. She likes to wear earrings.
- And what is the painting worth?
- $200,000.
- Your father must've made a lot of money.
- I guess.
- How much inheritance did you get?
- None.
The estate was bankrupt.
All unsold paintings
were destroyed in the fire...
...including the one Chelsea allegedly stole.
Okay.
We'll look at the painting
and if there's an inscription...
...l'll consider dropping the charges.
Great.
- Mr. Forrester.
- Come in.
I'm afraid I can't show the Deardon to you,
Mr. Logan.
I no longer own it.
- I don't understand.
- I traded it yesterday.
- Traded it to whom?
- To a gallery.
Which gallery?
Taft Gallery.
That painting is material evidence
in a felony proceeding.
Not anymore.
I've decided to drop
all charges against Chelsea.
- What?
- Why?
Her father and I were good friends.
Chelsea's had a difficult childhood.
It's obvious to me she acted on impulse.
There was no harm done.
And what did you receive
in return for the Deardon?
A Picasso for a Deardon?
I thought it was a good trade as well.
This is good.
So Taft didn't get a good trade?
Not if he intends to stay in business.
No offense, Logan,
but since I know something about art...
...let me do the talking.
- Sure.
Can I help you?
Mr. Logan, Miss Kelly. We're here
to see Mr. Taft. He's expecting us.
Yes. Wait here just one moment.
Dubuffet.
De Kooning.
Calder.
How about that?
Mr. Logan?
I'm Victor Taft.
Thanks for calling. I have a busy schedule.
We'll be brief. This is Miss Kelly.
- Pleasure.
- Magnificent gallery.
Do you have any Picassos around here
at this present time?
Yes. You're standing right in front of one.
Right.
Right. That's expensive?
Value is a relative thing, is it not?
Come. Let me show you around.
Picasso is one of the true masters
of this century.
Yet you traded a Picasso...
...for a Deardon,
which couldn't possibly be worth as much.
That particular Deardon
was one of his last.
A work of total confidence and maturity.
Deardon was my discovery,
so I feel proprietary about his work.
I pestered Forrester
to part with it for years.
Frankly, I was thrilled
when he finally agreed.
Let's set it on the stand.
It's a Bertolini. Startling, isn't it?
It was his model for a larger version.
I bet the price's equally startling.
It's not for sale.
It was given to me personally by the artist.
It has great sentimental value.
If you don't mind me asking, what's
your relationship with Chelsea Deardon?
Her father and I were very close.
I watched little Chelsea grow up.
Mr. Logan, you're leaning.
Sorry.
Recently, Chelsea and I have lost touch.
Her sensibility in art doesn't interest me.
She's a performance artist.
- Happenings, very ephemeral experiences.
- She's what?
- A performance artist.
- I hear she's quite talented.
Thank you, Roger.
It's very powerful.
- It is.
- I'd like to see the other side.
How refreshing.
Most clients prefer to see the front.
That was one of the shiftiest
performances I've seen.
I thought he was pretty straightforward.
What happened to the sixth sense
you're so famous for?
- Doesn't it feel too neatly tied up?
- Kelly, it's dead.
There's no signature.
The charges are dropped. It's done.
- Can I get you a cab?
- I can get my own cab, thanks.
God, give me a break.
Okay.
That's it.
No.
<i>- I couldn't let you do it.
- Why not?</i>
<i>You wouldn't be seen.
You'd be throwing away your own career.</i>
<i>It has nothing to do with my career.</i>
Someone's following me.
I'm scared. Can I come in?
Sure. How did you know where I live?
- I was afraid he'd follow me home.
- Who'd follow you home?
- The man.
- What man?
I don't know what man.
I've seen him three times today.
Where is he now?
Probably right out front.
I don't see anybody.
He's hiding.
Chelsea, you can't stay here.
Maybe a friend's house?
I don't have a friend.
Okay. I'll run you home.
Hang on. I'll get dressed.
Did you talk to Kelly?
Earlier.
So you know there's no signature
on the back of that painting?
You're sure Taft showed you
the right painting?
Are you familiar enough
with my father's work...
...to tell one from another?
Won't you come in?
Okay.
- Lot of room.
- Yes.
What's all this?
Something I'm working on.
Let me show you.
<i>Sit down.</i>
<i>Heart's desire, heart's desire.</i>
<i>Never, never play with fire.</i>
<i>Piece of cake.</i>
<i>Old flame.</i>
<i>I was driving down the highway.</i>
<i>I saw a car burning on the side of the road.</i>
<i>A woman was slumped over the wheel.</i>
<i>Her shoulders were shaking,
like she was crying.</i>
<i>Brush.</i>
<i>Brush fire.</i>
<i>Through the windshield,
on the hood of the car, there was a stack.</i>
<i>Maybe it was a small child.</i>
<i>As I drove by,
I noticed that nobody stopped.</i>
<i>Nobody stopped.</i>
<i>Neither did I.</i>
<i>Put out the fire.</i>
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>
<i>Fire.</i>
<i>Put out the fire.</i>
<i>Put out, put out.</i>
<i>Put out the fire.</i>
<i>Fire!</i>
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>
What did you think?
I...
...think...
...fine.
What did you think?
I think...
I think I'm uncomfortable.
- Good.
- Good?
Yeah, good.
That's what I'm trying to do:
Challenge your perspective.
Make you uncomfortable.
Still uncomfortable?
You bet.
You said your father had a journal?
Can I see it?
- Yeah.
- Now?
I'd have to find it.
It shouldn't take too long.
Maybe it's in the storeroom. I forget.
When was the last time you saw it?
- Two weeks ago.
- There's no journal, is there?
- Yes, there is.
- But you don't have it?
- Do you always cross-examine people?
- Only when they lie.
I have nothing from when father was alive.
There was a journal. There were paintings.
There was a fire.
I need your help.
I lied to you before because...
...I didn't think the truth was good enough.
He's there.
- What?
- He's there.
- No one's there.
- I feel it.
- I need some sleep.
- You can sleep here.
If there's trouble, call the police.
911, emergency.
Thanks for taking me home.
Something interesting up there?
<i>This is Laura Kelly.
I can't come to the phone...</i>
<i>... so leave your message at the tone...</i>
Get me the police.
Miss Kelly, I need to talk to you.
Office hours are 9:00 to 5:00.
My number's in the book.
I'm with the police.
My name is C.J. Cavanaugh.
I'm a detective. Manhattan South.
Just a minute.
- You have ID?
- Yes, ma'am.
Show it.
Yeah, that's ID.
Come on in.
- What's this about?
- The Deardon case.
There is no Deardon case.
The charges were dropped yesterday.
Wrong Deardon case.
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- I'll sit with you.
Seventeen years ago,
I headed an investigation...
...into the murder of Sebastian Deardon.
- Murder?
- Murder.
Could you excuse me?
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
- Can I get you something?
- No, no!
I read that case record.
There was nothing about murder.
You read the whitewash.
My report got filed in someone's
wastebasket down at City Hall.
Seventeen years ago...
...I pushed too hard on the case
with the captain in charge.
Suddenly, I'm busting winos.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to read this.
You're the Deardon girl's lawyer.
I hear you're curious.
Just read it.
If you need more, I can get it.
Is this stolen material?
If it's stolen,
you didn't get it from me, right?
- Try some tomato juice.
- Right.
Watson, have you seen Tom Logan?
Not since he buried me in court.
I'm not looking for him either.
Okay.
- Thompson, where's Logan?
- I'm late, unprepared, and doomed!
- I need Logan!
- He's in courtroom seven or six.
- You were having sex with him.
- No.
- I see.
- We have to talk.
- You don't deny it?
- On the contrary. I just denied it.
Miss Kelly.
Today is my birthday
and things are going so well.
- Are you going to spoil my birthday?
- Happy birthday, your Honor.
Begging the court's indulgence,
could I confer with Mr. Logan?
- Mr. Rustavlov?
- No objection, your honor.
Get on with it.
I called you last night.
Something incredible happened.
I'll say. I discovered that...
You called me?
Yeah. What discovery?
The Deardon case: Major fraud.
I've got hard evidence.
Your Honor,
an important matter has come up.
My learned assistant, Miss Freeman...
...will continue the cross-examination.
What? Me?
What about this hard evidence?
It's a complete collection
of Sebastian Deardon's paintings.
This is a confidential insurance file.
Where'd you get it?
I have my sources.
Notice the red stamps
near most of the paintings?
These were destroyed in the fire.
Look at 122.
Look familiar?
This looks like the painting Taft showed us.
Not looks like. It is. Notice the stamp?
This painting was supposedly
destroyed in the fire.
- I say we squeeze him.
- Squeeze? No.
We'll go slow with him.
I don't want to hear the word, fraud.
No matter what we have,
the whole thing could be a clerical error.
A $20 million clerical error?
I'm here with no authority whatsoever.
You're in possession of insurance files
of dubious origin.
Inside, I'll do the talking.
Stay behind me
and try to look like an attorney.
Yes, your Holiness.
At $2,700,000 on the right side.
Now at $2,700,000. Now say 8.
$2,800,000 on the aisle.
At $2,800,000. Now say 9.
At $2,800,000
on the left aisle and fair warning...
...at $2,800,000.
Sold for $2,800,000.
That's for number 176.
Your next lot is number 12.
Lot 12, the Renoir.
Mr. Taft, I'd like to ask
a few more questions about the Deardon.
I'm pursuing an elusive painting...
I'm sorry to bother you. Excuse me.
A colleague of mine
received some documents...
...related to art underwriting
by Seaboard Fidelity Company.
Please, I'm busy.
Not as many Deardons
were destroyed in the fire...
...as previously thought.
$1,300,000.
Gentleman's bid at $1,300,000.
- I have $1,300,000 on the left.
- Go to $1.8.
$1,400,000. I have $1,400,000.
I have $1,400,000. Now 5.
Five, $1,500,000.
The gentleman at the back.
$1,500,000. Now 6.
I carried Chelsea through the flames.
I saved her life.
Everything else burned to the ground.
The Deardon you showed us yesterday
managed to survive.
That's it. Get out,
before I have you thrown out.
- We're not making allegations...
- We know those paintings exist.
We think you have them.
If you repeat that allegation anywhere,
publicly or privately...
...l'll see you never practice law
in this country.
That won't be necessary.
I apologize for Miss Kelly's allegations...
...but I do represent the DA's office.
I'd like to see your business records.
So if you cooperate,
we can avoid any further unpleasantness.
You seem intelligent, Mr. Logan.
Far too intelligent to risk a career...
...by meddling in legitimate matters
which aren't your concern.
Am I making myself clear?
Perfectly.
You'll be subpoenaed in the morning.
I want all your records
for the past five years:
Shipping orders, inventories,
bills of sale, the works.
Otherwise, a federal marshal
will confiscate them...
...and you'll be subject to arrest.
Is that clear?
- 'Bye.
- Good-bye, Mr. Taft.
"Those paintings exist,
and we believe you have them."
- Didn't you learn anything in law school?
- Yeah, but we really shook him up.
- That look in your eyes at the end.
- What?
Pure blue steel.
- What?
- I'd like to develop one.
You don't develop looks. You just look.
Not me. I practice looks in the mirror.
- I picked one up from you.
- What?
I'm cross-examining someone and
I get an answer I don't believe...
...this is what you do.
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.
- I don't do that.
- All the time.
Come on.
You stand by the jury, give a quarter-turn,
then give that exact look.
I saw it,
you totally discredited Van Dyke with it.
Van Dyke? You were in the courtroom?
Some people go to ballgames.
I go to court.
Do you have the keys?
Yeah.
Hang on.
I'll be right back.
Where did you learn this?
I used to... Never mind.
You can't always get it at first.
Well, you're closer.
Much closer. There, you got it.
It's Taft.
- Sure seems to be in a hurry.
- Yeah.
- Logan, don't lose him.
- I won't. Where did he go?
Right up there.
Just up ahead.
Not that car. It's the gray Mercedes.
The idea is not to get too close.
- That's the idea?
- Hurry, but don't get too close.
Ease back a little. That's it.
You're doing good.
Okay.
Pull over to the right
so we can make a right-hand turn.
Can you do that?
What are you doing? Logan. Get back in.
- You drive.
- No.
You seem to know what to do.
You're doing great. Get back in the car.
- It's your turn, really. Drive.
- I can't.
- What?
- I can't drive.
The light's changing.
- Let's...
- Don't even say it. Don't even think it.
You've got a lot of enthusiasm
and that may not be bad, but...
...if we go in there,
it's breaking and entering.
It's not breaking, it's entering.
There's no law against that.
- There are hundreds of them.
- Not for an official pursuing a felon.
No. He's not a felon.
Pursuing a probable felon.
Probable felon.
"Boston vs. Cavalero, 1967.
"If a public official
is pursuing a probable felon...
"...he or she may enter an unlocked
storage area without a warrant...
"...when there's reasonable suspicion
of unlawful activities therein."
Boston vs...
Come here.
Come here.
I'm just taking a peek.
An open door is practically an invitation.
I can cite cases where implied invitation
is a valid reason to enter.
- In a building with a security...
- Do you hear something?
It's Taft. Coming, Victor.
He invited you, too.
Jesus.
I don't want to blur your concentration,
but we're locked in.
- What's all this flammable stuff?
- Look at this.
Here's the business records we wanted.
Letters of incorporation dated 1962.
Three-man partnership.
Triad Enterprises.
Victor Taft, counseling.
Victor Taft, Robert Forrester,
Joseph Brock.
- Brock?
- Taft and Forrester were partners.
No wonder they traded
that painting so quickly.
Deardon's name is everywhere.
Joseph Brock.
What the hell happened to him?
His name disappeared in 1962.
Here's the insurance payoffs
on the Deardon paintings.
What's that sound, your watch?
No.
Victor Taft and Robert Forrester
were co-beneficiaries.
Do something.
Hold it. Move. Let's go.
Here. Down here!
- Jump!
- Jump?
Are you all right?
- You all right?
- I'm okay.
You all right?
I don't ever want to do this again.
Never again.
Make out a warrant
for Taft's arrest for arson.
I think you should know
the chief is totally crazed.
He's popping those little pills like M&Ms.
He almost let the police charge you both
with breaking and entering.
He's probably never heard of Boston vs...
- Cavalero.
- Right.
Make sure the detective squad hires
some art experts...
...to sift through the wreckage.
- Art experts.
- Yeah.
How'd the trial go? Did you win it?
I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey, Miss Kelly.
- Cavanaugh.
Are you okay? I heard all about it.
Must have been a hell of a bang.
I'm talking to the lady.
I'm listening to you talk to the lady.
- Who is this guy?
- Who is this guy?
C.J. Cavanaugh, detective.
This is Tom Logan,
Assistant District Attorney.
- This is supposed to be between us.
- We're doing this together.
- Doing what together?
- It's just an expression.
Detective Cavanaugh investigated
the original Deardon fire.
You know something about the case?
Yeah, I know something about it.
What about this partnership
between Taft and Forrester and...
- Brock.
- Brock, yeah.
There's not much to tell.
The three partners were cooking the books.
Phony tax records.
IRS starts sniffing around.
Taft and Forrester set up Joe Brock
to take the fall.
Brock was in jail
when Deardon was murdered.
- Murdered?
- The way I see it.
What happened to Brock?
Brock was not a lucky man.
He got cancer after his release from prison.
Buried in Kansas City in 1972.
That's it?
Yeah, that's it, for now.
I do something for you...
...you do something for me.
That's my home phone number.
If you come up with anything, call me.
Snow. That's...
I'm having dinner with my daughter.
Want to join us? You hungry?
- I have a date.
- A what?
A date.
You know, where a man
invites a woman out and they...
I know. I'm just wondering...
- Are you in any kind of condition to...
- Pardon me?
You look a little... Forget it.
Logan...
...if there's anything at all
about me you like...
...could you tell me what that is right now?
I like your eyes.
Yeah?
They're very warm eyes.
Thank you.
- Cold ears.
- Very cold.
- Want a lift?
- Yes.
May I come in?
Don't ever be a lawyer.
Everybody hates lawyers.
When you get to be district attorney
do you have to go into politics?
I'm already in politics.
Politics is more than running for elections.
Politics should be the wise exercise,
distribution, and maintenance of power.
Then what's sexual politics?
Sexual politics?
Well, that's when you have...
Sex is...
If two...
Is it like when you call a boy,
but he won't call you...
...because he's too cool...
...so you call him to tell him he's cool.
He tells everyone you like him,
but he doesn't have to say he likes you.
Well then, politics is
just getting what you want?
Wait a minute. What have we got here?
I did something crazy.
- I went to Victor's with a gun.
- A gun?
Come in.
I wanted to know
where my father's paintings were.
He knocked me around.
He took the gun away.
I got panicky. He hit me.
I managed to get out.
- Did you call Kelly?
- Yes. Her machine was on.
Victor said he'd call the police.
I'm really scared.
We've got to get you dry.
You can use the bathroom.
- This is my daughter, Jennifer.
- Hi.
It's okay.
She looks guilty to me, Dad.
A juror doesn't make a determination
until he has all the evidence.
Will I get to know her really well?
No, but you still have to be
on your best behavior.
You, too. Right, Dad?
Hold it. It might be the police.
Why are you protecting her?
She's your girlfriend, isn't she?
No.
Look who's here. What a surprise.
- Hi, Mom. We thought you were the cops.
- What?
- She's ready. Are you ready?
- Yeah.
What's the matter with you guys?
You're acting...
In front of the kid?
Nothing happened in front of the child.
Dad didn't hit her in the face.
It was a guy she robbed with a gun.
Thanks.
Congratulations.
Perfect environment to raise my daughter.
- She's our daughter. Don't forget it.
- I'm trying to forget that.
I'll make sure she knows
you didn't do anything.
- 'Bye.
- Be good.
What do you want, Ed?
It's none of your business.
- I screwed things up for you, didn't I?
- Forget it.
- I'm always doing that.
- Forget it.
- Mind if I make myself some tea?
- No, I'll make... I'll call Kelly.
<i>Hi. This is Laura Kelly.
Leave your message...</i>
First thing in the morning, you'll call Kelly.
Then you're gonna file a report
with the police.
Why can't you come with me?
Why? Because...
Because she's your attorney. I'm not.
Personal question?
What do you think of me?
Interesting.
The other night when I kissed you...
...what did you think of that?
Dangerous.
That's a carefully chosen word.
Carefully chosen words are the tools
of my profession.
I think you've got everything here.
This has been such a complicated day.
Let's hope everything's fine.
See you in the morning.
Freeze! Hold it! Don't move!
You have the right to remain silent...
- Who are you?
- Freeze! Don't move again.
Hey, guys! What the hell's happening?
Chelsea Deardon, you're under arrest
for the murder of Victor Taft.
Murder! It's not true!
Anything you say can be held against you.
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Looks like she already had her attorney.
Get your clothes on, pal.
Were you in bed with the suspect?
They're calling you the darling DA.
<i>Our clairvoyant at World's People says
Chelsea's carrying your child.</i>
The police said you were both naked.
Do you usually examine suspects this way?
One year!
I had one more year.
Now what will they remember?
The 67,000 convictions I got?
No, they'll remember one horny bastard...
...who made my office a laughingstock.
When we service this community...
...we do it with our pants on!
Who sent the cops to my place?
Who knew Chelsea was there?
- An anonymous caller.
- Most anonymous calls are ignored.
Most anonymous calls don't involve
an assistant district attorney.
I'm shot at, my suspect blows up
a building and then gets killed.
Somebody's setting me up.
I have no alternative.
You're suspended
for 90 days pending investigation.
What?
Suspend me?
That's a cheap, political dodge.
Suspend me when I need your support?
No.
You're right. I'm not going to suspend you.
- Don't say it.
- You're fired.
You can't do that. I won't accept it.
- You're fired!
- I quit!
- You what?
- I quit. 'Bye.
You what?
- I saw your picture in the paper.
- What about it?
Nothing. The press gave you a raw deal.
This subpoena demands you show cause...
...why you're inhibiting
your daughter's education.
Your former wife has brought charges.
You may bring legal counsel to the hearing.
Give 'em hell.
You want to play rough?
Want to find out how good a lawyer I am?
Well, you got it.
By the time I finish,
I'll cut you into legal pieces.
Jennifer. Hi, sweetie.
No. I'm fine. I'm good.
I'm angry, that's all. Is Mom there?
When she gets out of the tub,
tell her I called.
Great. Okay. Fine.
I love you, too. 'Bye.
- Sorry, boss. Elliott Blanchard...
- Not you.
Not now.
I was just checking out the office.
It's my office until I clean out my desk.
Wouldn't listen, would you?
Everything had to be done your way.
You're history.
I'll talk to you later, Doreen.
What?
What happened?
I can't discuss it now.
<i>There's an excellent account in the Post.
Bit lurid, but highly provocative.</i>
<i>I read the Post.</i>
So you know, or think you know.
You tell me otherwise.
Tell me you didn't sleep with my client.
- Damn it.
- Damn it? Is that what you said?
Yes, damn it, Logan.
Why did you sleep with her?
Did you have to make
your conquest public?
Right. It's my mistake.
I should have kicked her out
into the street.
I made the mistake and I'll pay for it...
Me, Tom Logan.
Ex-Assistant District Attorney.
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you.
Don't. Don't ever help me again. Please.
It's obvious that you're being set up.
We both know Chelsea was framed.
This trumped up murder charge
is more of the same.
A person is entitled to his or her opinion.
Lawyers have to prove them in court.
- I can prove it.
- Yeah?
I could prove it.
Especially if I had help from someone...
...that knew as much about it as I did.
- What are you saying?
- Someone...
...that would greatly benefit
by Chelsea's acquittal.
- No.
- Just for this one case, Logan.
You'd get your job back,
and I'd be on my way.
You get one side of the desk.
I get the other.
You have three drawers on your side.
I have three on mine.
We can share the center one.
I'll put the phone right in the middle.
My side will be very messy.
I like it like that way
so don't try to straighten it up.
All right.
Can we discuss Chelsea's defense?
Well, in my opinion...
...we have to cloud the issues,
get the focus off Chelsea.
We have two witnesses.
How can we discredit them?
Do they have criminal records?
Do they pay their bills,
parking tickets, bounced checks?
You know, what kind of people are they?
Any old trick to get the client off?
You're a defense attorney now.
You're supposed to get the client off.
I'll need more room here.
I've got to have room to pace.
I'm a pacer.
Can we get down to basics now?
Is she guilty? Do we think she killed Taft?
- She is capable of killing.
- I don't think she killed Taft.
Everything's based
on circumstantial evidence.
Absolutely.
We don't have to disprove anything.
- We just have to cast doubt.
- Right.
Right.
There's one more important issue here.
What?
Are you going to sleep
with our client again?
- What has that got to do with the trial?
- Everything.
- She's a very attractive young girl.
- Extremely attractive.
I didn't say extremely,
I said just attractive.
Extremely.
- She has a nice body.
- A sensational body.
I'll pick the adjectives. A good body.
Big eyes.
- Hypnotic.
- Big eyes.
- Unforgettable.
- Are you going to sleep with her again?
No.
Good.
That's all I wanted to know.
All rise. The Supreme Court
for the State of New York...
...is now in session.
The honorable judge
John Dawkins is presiding.
Please be seated.
The case for the people of New York vs.
Chelsea Deardon is ready for arraignment.
Counsel and defendant are both present.
Regarding this change of venue...
...does defense wish
to engage in oral argument?
- We don't.
- Yes, we do.
- We don't.
- Yes, we do.
Which is it?
- No, we don't.
- Of course.
We move for a change of venue
due to misleading exposure in the press.
- I object.
- You object to your own co-counsel?
I do, yes.
I see.
Would counsel approach the bench, please?
Is this the way things will be?
Everyone in New York
has read about this case.
- You know someplace looser morally?
- I'm addressing His Honor.
Flip a coin to decide who'll speak...
Enough already. Motion is denied.
Does defense wish to enter a plea?
Yes, Chelsea Deardon pleads "not guilty."
Your plea is noted. Call the next case.
The State of New York
vs. Christian Clemenson.
You're a good typist.
I thought I'd need something
to fall back on...
...in case I didn't finish law school.
- Dad's a terrible typist.
- I've noticed.
- But he has his good points.
- Yeah.
You guys like each other, don't you?
Yeah.
I see the way you look at each other.
I like the way he moves.
Yeah, until he trips over something, right?
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Are there any calls?
- Just Mom. She's on her way over.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
I had a talk with Mom
and got her to cancel the subpoena.
How did you get her to do that?
I told her you said I could go to California.
What?
But you get to pick me up on June 1,
in LA and keep me for 60...
...90 consecutive days.
What do you know about this?
Did you do this?
You did this.
You thought I'd buy the deal?
Now, you have her four days a month,
48 days a year.
- I got you 42 more days.
- That's almost double, Dad.
I can add.
That's Mom.
- You got everything?
- Yeah.
Here, take this, this time.
Dad?
So what do I tell her?
She's got a deal.
- Okay.
- 'Bye.
'Bye.
You guys are a great team.
You have a lot in common.
- What's she mean "a lot in common"?
- I don't know.
Earlier, she said you liked me.
She's just a kid.
She's a pretty bright kid.
You have the case load.
- You're going to bring that.
- You have the trial notes?
Bring them over tomorrow.
- All right.
- Good night.
All right.
- That was nice.
- Yes, it was.
See you tomorrow.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...we, the people,
will prove beyond a reasonable doubt...
...that on the night of October 7,
Chelsea Elizabeth Deardon...
...did commit the crime of murder
against one Victor Taft.
That, with intent to cause
the death of Victor Taft...
...she shot him in the chest three times.
We'll call witnesses
who'll testify under oath to seeing...
...Chelsea Deardon flee the scene.
Ballistics will prove...
...the gun was registered
to Chelsea Deardon.
And most important...
...her fingerprints were all over that gun.
We'll prove Chelsea Deardon
was at the scene of the crime...
...had the means to commit a crime
and had every opportunity to do so.
Opportunity and means:
Crucial evidence which, by themselves,
could establish guilt...
...beyond a reasonable doubt
in a murder case.
But we will also provide
a compelling motive as well.
This was a crime committed by a woman...
...who was secretly Victor Taft's
lover for two years...
...during which time he was
her only means of financial support.
It's been one lie after another.
We looked like incompetent idiots.
Why didn't you tell us about it?
Thought you could hide it?
It wasn't common knowledge.
We never went out in public together.
If you knew,
it would make me look more guilty.
You went to his apartment,
you had a fight and killed him!
No! I didn't!
We fought, but I didn't kill him.
You shot Taft, went to Logan's apartment...
...and involved him
so he'd clear everything.
I went there because I was scared.
Why don't you believe me?
I didn't kill anyone.
That's the most preposterous explanation
I've ever heard.
Yeah, it is.
- I believe her.
- What?
Based on her track record so far?
No, hunch. Instinct.
Let's hope it's coming
from above the waist.
I believe her, too.
Okay, she's telling the truth.
You ready to do some tap dancing?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chelsea Deardon didn't kill Victor Taft.
The prosecution has suggested
a possible motive...
...but one based on hearsay, conjecture
and circumstantial evidence.
Evidence that appears
to have some substance...
...but upon closer examination...
...will prove to have no relevance
whatsoever to this case.
You're not buying this, are you?
You're not listening to a word I'm saying.
Guess what? I don't blame you.
After listening to Mr. Blanchard lay out
the prosecution's evidence...
...even I'm convinced
my client murdered Victor Taft.
After all, if I had found
Victor Taft dead on the floor...
...and Chelsea Deardon's
fingerprints on the weapon...
...there isn't much that would convince me
she isn't guilty.
Look. Let's save ourselves a lot of time.
Let's be honest.
There are better things we could be doing.
Who thinks Chelsea Deardon's guilty?
Objection your honor.
Mr. Logan.
Don't hold back. My hand is raised.
I believe my client murdered
Victor Taft in cold blood.
Isn't everybody convinced?
- Mr. Logan.
- Who agrees with me?
- I object!
- Mr. Logan.
- You're convinced, right?
- Your Honor.
- Your Honor!
- Prosecution says she's guilty.
The jury says she's guilty.
Let's save the State of New York...
...a lot of time and money
and move directly to sentencing.
- What?
- Isn't she entitled to a fair trial?
Let's give her one and then convict her.
Mr. Logan!
You are totally out of order! You know it!
This jury is disqualified.
Let's take a recess
while I consider holding you in contempt.
I recognize my opening remarks
are irregular...
...but, please, let me continue
even though the jury...
...may consider my client guilty
at this time, I still believe in this jury...
...and will accept their final verdict,
whatever it might be.
I concur, Your Honor.
Prosecution has equal faith
in this jury, Your Honor.
May I proceed?
Very well. You may proceed, Mr. Logan.
Thank you, Your Honor.
So we all think she's guilty.
What do we do?
That's a dilemma, isn't it?
A problem because we've developed...
...a legal concept in this country
to protect ourselves...
...to protect our rights...
...and it's called,
"presumption of innocence."
In simpler words that means
that one is presumed innocent...
...until proven guilty.
That means that whatever
assumptions you've already made...
...Chelsea Deardon must be seen
in your eyes...
...believed in your minds,
understood in your hearts...
...to be innocent.
So what is the truth?
Maybe the truth begins 18 years ago...
...when dozens of paintings...
...works of art by the defendant's father,
Sebastian Deardon...
...supposedly perished in a fire,
which also tragically took his life.
Now, the insurance paid on those paintings
totaled $2.5 million.
That's a staggering sum...
...but only a fraction
of what they'd be worth today.
We believe...
...that those paintings still exist...
...and are today worth
more than $20 million.
Victor Taft was not murdered
as an act of revenge by the defendant.
Victor Taft was murdered
to protect someone...
...someone who himself, 18 years ago...
...was a co-conspirator
to arson, fraud, and murder.
Someone who took advantage
of Chelsea Deardon...
...and tried to frame her for a crime
he himself was responsible for.
Listen, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a complex case...
...but I'm confident that
once you've heard all the evidence...
...that you will come to a decision
that is the truth.
And the truth is,
Chelsea Deardon is innocent.
Thank you.
Without objection, this court is adjourned
until 9:00 Monday morning.
Eloquent, Tom.
Better have the goods by Monday.
Yeah, just show up, Blanchard.
Congratulations, counselor.
If you meant to baffle them with bullshit,
my hat is off to you.
If that's an indication
of where you're heading...
Count on it, Forrester.
Daddy!
- Murderer.
- What?
- How dare you?
- I was there.
A small child was there,
hardly qualified to come to a conclusion.
You're a liar.
I won't be made the scapegoat...
...for the desperate act
of an emotionally disturbed woman.
Is that clear?
<i>Could you get Mr. Crane
in records, please?</i>
Mr. Crane...
...I have Mr. Morrison from claims.
One moment, please.
Crane?
Crane, where are they?
I'm talking about the shipping files,
the Taft Gallery warehouse shipping files.
Where are they?
I've got customers all over me.
Claim they never arrived.
Immediately!
No, not tomorrow, now.
Taft! Do I have to spell it?
Get them to me right away.
Morrison. Claims. Now!
Otherwise you can talk
to the legal department.
May I help you?
Is this claims?
No. That's on 26.
How do I look?
Joe Morrison. It's my first day on the job.
Trying to make a good impression.
- Where's my office?
- Morrison.
Nobody told me. Are you sure?
- Laura, do you have that...
- Yes, of course, Mr. Morrison.
"Effective immediately,
Joseph J. Morrison..." That's me.
"Position of claims adjuster."
It's all here. This is claims, isn't it?
Yeah. Was somebody let go?
What a jungle.
They fire someone
and don't even tell them?
- That's corporate America.
- This memo isn't signed. I'll have...
- Mr. Morrison's office?
- That's me, son.
I need to do this from my office.
Which one is it?
I'll have to speak to Mr. Phillips.
About this. Please wait here.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hong Kong. Two crates.
Please excuse me. What?
You put the London form in the Asian pile.
- That's not the Asian pile.
- What's that, South America?
No. Medium-sized crate pile.
We're doing it geographically.
We look for a pattern,
then what breaks the pattern.
I know that, but I'm doing it by size. See?
"Taft Gallery to Victor Taft, 40 x 80 x 15."
- I see, but...
- Very large crate, large crate.
Guess where it goes? Large crate pile.
Here's another one.
"Taft Gallery to Victor Taft." Very large.
Where did they ship?
Manhattan. Sutton Place.
I thought Taft lived on Central Park West.
<i>Dates?</i>
<i>Mid-September, all of them.</i>
<i>About the time we were at the gallery.</i>
So Taft sends himself a large shipment
to a strange address?
About the same time we went to see him.
The Deardons!
It's me.
I think they found what you're looking for.
You'll get there first. I'll take care of it.
Want to drive?
- You all right?
- I'm all right.
Logan, what are you doing?
Logan!
Logan!
What's your rush, man?
What's wrong with you?
I can do this. I can do this!
Holy shit!
God! Are you okay?
He ran right in front of me!
- You see it?
- I heard it.
Okay.
Logan!
- What are you doing?
- He took his wallet!
- Get in!
- Kelly! Brake!
Police!
Are you okay?
- Good driving.
- Thanks.
Credit cards.
$45 cash. Cleaners.
Look at this.
Robert Forrester's business card.
- Forrester?
- Forrester.
What we got here is Fort Knox.
Here's Taft. 2-B.
Okay, you can come up,
but none of that funny stuff.
Yeah? Then what's
the point of coming up?
What's this? It's open.
Be careful.
Chuck Close.
The Transcontinental Express.
The same size as the shipment.
Somebody's already
been through this stuff.
Campbell's soup.
Look at this Lichtenstein!
God, it must be worth $200,000.
Why would somebody leave these
lying around here?
Mondrian...
...Steinberg...
There's millions of dollars worth
of paintings here...
...but no Deardons.
Look at this.
A wall-to-wall bed.
You could have a tag-team match on it.
Tom...
If Taft has... Jeez!
Forrester.
I'm going to call the police.
No, on second thought,
maybe we shouldn't call the police.
Maybe we should...
What?
What?
You scared me to death.
What are you doing here?
You left me a message to meet you here.
- There was no message.
- You left a message.
How did you get in here?
This was Victor's and my place.
I have a key.
Oh no, not again.
Okay, let's hear it.
That famous Logan instinct.
You first.
I don't see how she could've lifted
a 200-pound man on the bed.
Therefore, she's innocent.
What in the hell is that?
Where have I seen that before?
That's the Bertolini.
Remember we saw the model
in Taft's office?
The one he couldn't sell
for sentimental reasons.
Victor hated that sculpture.
He thought Bertolini was a joke.
We have got to get to the Taft Gallery.
I'll find Cavanaugh...
...get a search warrant
and meet you at the gallery soon.
<i>The private Victor Taft
was an incredibly warm human being...</i>
<i>A leader...</i>
<i>... a benefactor.</i>
<i>Victor Taft championed my work...</i>
<i>... at a time when
no one else was interested.</i>
<i>But Victor had vision.</i>
<i>The contribution that Victor made
to young artists...</i>
<i>... and through them...</i>
What do you think?
- It sounds hollow.
- Yeah.
Detective Cavanaugh, you guys. Where...
Detective Cavanaugh?
- I'm looking for Detective Cavanaugh.
- That's me. What can I do for you?
- You're Cavanaugh?
- Yeah.
You're the only Detective Cavanaugh
in Manhattan South?
There must be a way into this.
Cavanaugh.
The name's Joe Brock.
And whatever's inside
that piece of crap belongs to me.
Oh, God!
Shit!
Hey! What are you doing there?
Breaking into my car.
Is that the gun you used
to kill Taft and Forrester?
It just might be the gun I use to kill you.
Take that.
Okay, Kelly, take a whack at it.
Pretend it's my head.
Who was the guy that shot at us?
The one that followed Chelsea?
Nobody. A hired hand, paid to do a job.
It's in there!
Come on, hit it again!
When did you decide to kill Taft,
Cavanaugh?
After Taft and Forrester set me up
for prison.
Just waited for my chance. Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
It's mine!
Fire!
Oh, God.
Please hurry.
Come on, Chelsea!
Go on!
- Can we go down the stairs?
- No, you can't get out there.
- Over here!
- Chelsea come on!
Down here.
Let's go!
What about me?
Over here.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
And so in conclusion,
Your Honor, in light of the new...
...and seemingly incontrovertible
evidence presented before this court...
...on the admirable initiative
of the estimable co-counsels for defense...
...we, the people, recommend
that all charges against...
...Chelsea Elizabeth Deardon...
...be dismissed.
So be it.
This case is dismissed.
Court is adjourned.
Congratulations, Tom.
Wonderful job.
Comeback of the year!
I had a little help.
Yeah, sure. Good work, Miss...
- Kelly.
...Kelly.
- Tom, you got a great opportunity here.
- What?
All these reporters here
to launch your campaign...
- Campaign!
- For district attorney, remember?
I remember being fired as an assistant DA.
You were never fired officially.
Never put the paperwork through.
In his own way,
he was backing you 100 percent.
You must think like a politician.
Tom, you're the hottest legal property.
We could win this election
by just announcing your candidacy.
What do you say?
Forget it.
- Forget it?
- Forget it.
Too proud to come back?
Too happy where I am.
Should have put the paperwork through.
Ms. Deardon, what will happen
to your father's paintings?
I'm not sure.
I'm just happy they still exist.
Were you ever actually in love with Taft?
Once.
Maybe.
I can't remember.
Yet you lived with him for some time.
Some time for one purpose.
How do you feel now?
Vintage Chelsea.
First she seduces Taft
'cause she needed information.
Then she seduces you
because she needed help.
With the risk of seeming immodest
I think what she did with me...
...was because she found me
simply attractive.
It's perfectly understandable.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Because Chelsea's good at
luring men onto her bed.
Extremely good.
No, no. I pick the adjectives.
"Big eyes."
"Hypnotic eyes."
"Unforgettable eyes." She has great eyes!
Yes, she does...
...but they're not as great as yours.
