You want to take the wheel, Sade?
Sade.
Housekeeping.
It's a little early.
You're lucky it's just me.
Could be my ass.
Do you know who I am?
Yeah.
You're the T-man.
"I'm Gonna Make You Nine."
You're Trucker.
Your turn.
I'm Sadie Flood.
I sing.
- This is great.
- This is my happy home.
My retreat from care.
There's a place for everything
and everything's in its place.
It's how I keep track.
You understand?
Who are you expecting?
What you think you were doin'?
You need to do what I tell ya.
- What?
- If we gonna go this journey,
I don't mean for you
to look at, talk to...
Or fraternize.
My sidemen got friends.
They don't need friends.
You with me.
Respect it.
Hello, Chasman.
Howya doin'?
Great. I'm great.
This is great. How are you?
That's so great.
I guess I'm gonna
have to kill you.
Joke, Sadie. Blanks.
We're here.
Where's the cat?
Bummen
Stephen Fasten 1859.
Whoo! Whoo!
Thank you.
We've been trying out
some new songs.
- I knew you'd be here.
- I didn't know I'd be here.
Well, I felt you out there.
Hey, Mish is here.
Did you see Mish?
Andrew's asleep in the dressing room.
He'll wander out in a minute.
God, you look amazing.
Well, you always look amazing.
- I look like shit Jake.
- No, not to me. Never.
-This is Chasman.
- Hiya.
-This is Jake.
- Best man in the world.
Hiya.
Uh, could I get you
somethin' to eat?
- How you doin' Sadie?
- No thanks, Jake.
- Incredible out there tonight, huh?
- Pretty intense.
- So how you doin'?
- Great.
Heard you were with the Trucker.
That true?
For about half a second.
You heard that?
- He's my man, you know.
- You heard that, huh?
Oh, God. God.
Good to see you.
You were great out there, man.
So in-fucking-credibly great.
You tear me up, you know?
What did Dad used to say?
God kissed her.
- God kissed that girl.
- God, I'm glad you're here.
Well.
-Well. - Hey, Mish.
- Hey.
- I get a hug?
- Sure.
- You don't have to.
- No, sure.
That was great.
So, are you drinking?
You know me.
Whatever’s cheap or free.
So you're here in Seattle?
- Looks like it.
- Hello.
-This is Chasman.
-Hi.
- He's with me.
-Oh?
Came up from San Francisco.
Saved my life.
- Oh.
- Hello.
I'm a fan.
So Sadie said you were her sister.
- Chasman's a promoter.
- Oh.
- What do you promote?
- Me.
Sadie's among my clients.
Yeah, my star client.
I met Sadie in San Francisco.
- I'm from London originally.
- Oh?
Baland.
You can hear the accent.
- Where you staying? -Well, I thought, you
know, I'd come home for a little maybe.
Oh, that'd be great.
- Ferguson heard you were with Trucker.
- Emmett Trucker?
I'm-gonna-make-you-mine Trucker.
Yeah. For about half a minute.
- Yeah. - You were great.
You were great tonight.
- What you do up there.
- Thank you.
- I know you think that
sounds like bullshit - No.
We're staying in town tonight.
- Let us get you a room at the hotel.
- Unless you--
- That'd be great. - So you were
thinking of staying with us a little.
- Until I got settled.
- Uh, that's fantastic.
- I could help with the house.
- Well, maybe not.
- Has someone got an eye on Andrew?
- Andrew's fine.
- Miss, you wanna go see to Andrew?
- Sure.
- See you, Sadie.
- You bet!
What are your plans?
-Chasman.
- He's gotta go back.
- Not tonight.
- No, not tonight.
Not tomorrow maybe neither.
- It's along ride.
- Well, we'll see, won't we?
- There's tons of food over there.
- Can I fix you a plate?
Well, I was thinking
of you guys, actually.
I mean, it fired loud.
But I didn't get hit by anything.
He had guns everywhere.
He just always thinks
people are doin' him in.
- So he's always expecting,
like, a siege. - Mish?
So everybody's out to get you.
And also... germs.
He has a thing about germs.
And the faucet had to be
right in the middle of the sink...
Or his life was ruined.
- Come on, you guys.
- You want me to take 'em?
- No, I'll take'em.
- Well, Sadie's here.
- I'll take'em. Andrew!
- Is there brown sugar?
And he would do
these midnight raids...
Where he would look through the
cupboards to see if I'd eaten anything.
- Mish.
- Are there any grapes?
He's definitely
multiple personalities.
I mean there were
three main ones,
and two were very mean.
And then there were,
like, subgroups.
There you go, Druid.
He'd roll a joint big as cigars.
He was real nice
when he smoked.
He'd became really mellow. He could smoke
two huge spliffs and still sing great.
And you know,
he can be so wonderful.
He can be
such a fabulous singer.
He has great vocal range,
great breath control.
You guys have about 20 minutes
before you have to be out that door.
That woman can sure as hell sing.
As opposed to what?
Did I say something?
I didn't mean anything by it, Jake.
Everything's Jake.
Jake.
- Is she gonna stay?
- Don't know.
Mish, you're gonna
ruin your eyes.
What are you doin'?
It's 8:00 in the morning.
You need not to do that
around the kids, okay?
Wouldn't.
I don't need to say
I'm grateful I'm here.
No, Sadie.
- How was the tour?
- It was great.
- I wasn't on the tour.
-Oh?
- I don't manage the band anymore.
-No?
Not for six years, Sadie.
You don't know
what the hell I do, do you?
I do. Sure I do.
You are so fucked.
I do.
I teach and I write.
- I knew that.
- I wanna start workin' the farm.
I like doin' stuff
with my hands.
They think they own her.
I'd be walkin' around, makin' sure the
sound was good and everything's fine,
and I've had guys go,
"Hey, you with the band?
God, I'd like to fuck her"
You know you gotta bland it off.
You know?
See, we've been through it.
She slept with somebody
so I slept with somebody...
Or we thought we were
gonna sleep with somebody.
The fights are one thing,
but the sex--
We hurt each other. We've done
just about every lie there is.
Sometimes I am amazed
that somehow we're still here.
And all I can think about
is that I fell in love with her...
The moment I laid eyes on her.
She's Georgia you know?
And we’re gonna grow old together
- I stripped the beds.
- You didn't need to do that.
-Yeah, well, sure, I did.
- It's pouring Sadie.
And you hang them out.
How dumb to forget.
Well, no harm done.
I borrowed this, okay?
Whatever. It's fine. You don't need
to clean the house, Sadie.
I was cleaning motel rooms.
Really. No, really!
Oh, God.
Sadie reduced to that.
Or is there anything Sadie
can't be reduced to?
- You wanna give me a break, Sadie?
- You wanna give me one?
I can feel what you're feeling.
No. No, you can't.
You can't feel what I'm feeling.
You aren't me.
I think we should not
get into this.
Fine. Better for me.
Shit.
Dad's coming
to stay a week, Friday.
- I'll be here.
- Gets really tense Sadie.
I'll be here, okay?
- How's he doin'?
- Fine.
I think fine.
I think all right.
You need some money?
Yeah. Yeah.
Somethin' to get started on.
I'm good for it.
I don't want you
to be good for it.
It pleases me to be able to give it to you.
I love being able to give it to you.
Okay.
Things are gonna break for me.
There is not a doubt in my mind.
This has all gotta be
about something.
This whole... adventure.
Everything is stored
for later use.
There must be a pony.
Thank you.
We're gonna take a little break.
Buy a pitcher of beer. We like the gig.
Whatever he's drinkin',
I'm buyin'.
- You want another round?
- No.
- Nice dress.
- It's Georgia's.
I hear you’re lookin'
for a backup singer.
- And where'd you hear that?
-I made it up.
Come on, Bobby.
I want two solos.
Come on, Bobby.
We were good together.
Leland's still with you.
And Paul.
You wanna sit in?
Yeah.
- How was San Francisco?
- Had a few gigs.
- Got myself a manager.
-Yeah?
You had a gig with Trucker.
Yeah. Unreal.
Wanna welcome a good friend,
Georgia's baby sister.
Sadie Flood!
Come on you all! Give it up!
"Almost Blue."
Hi.
- Hi.
- Comrade.
- Okay
- Thank you.
I forgot how much
I love this place.
Only a couple of days, Sadie.
That's it.
Scout's honor.
If we take you on,
the first time you fuck us over--
- I'm not gonna fuck you over.
- 'Cause the band's doin' okay.
I'm not going
to fuck you over, Bobby.
You snow up standing up.
Both.
You've been outta my life, Sadie.
I don't want you back in,
not like before.
Yeah, I know.
It's okay. Don't shit where you eat.
It's top of the list.
Sadie, with the makeup?
A hairless of everything.
You're the boss.
- Did you fuck him?
-Who?
- Trucker.
- No.
Supposed to rain tomorrow.
Nobody answer the phone!
See you guys.
Which ones mellon?
- Me. - What, nobody answers
their phone anymore?
- Do you think you're gonna play in this?
- Hey, we got a gig, we show up.
Yeah, right.
We love you, Seattle!
We'll be back in 15.
Great song. You're great!
Okay, pal, you too.
- What'd you have Sadie?
- It was blow.
- I would've took it.
- I offered, Herman.
- Was I there?
-Yeah, Herman.
- Wow.
- What do you want with blow, Herman?
- What'd you do with it?
-I flushed it.
I wish you'd have asked.
You know where you are, Herman?
We're in a fucking bowling alley.
- You got a way home?
- Yeah. Leland.
- Delivery.
- Yeah!
- Thanks. - Uh, Mr. Bruno had me
stop at the liquor store on the way.
Mr. Bruno's a great man.
How much do I owe you?
Um, groceries are $4.53,
and the liquoris...
$36.60.
Come in.
Gotta take those down.
Whew.
Never get a chance
to pick up, you know?
Days just... phew.
Get away from me.
That's $41.13.
-Are you all right?
- What? Yeah, I'm okay.
I mean, I'm not
a maniac or anything.
And there's
a little something for you.
- Hey, you know, I don't-- I don't feel
right about that. - Well, it's not a lot.
- I'd like you to have it.
- I know who you are.
Yeah?
- Well, I try to catch you.
- Well, I'm glad you're out there.
No, I do, whenever you--
I think you're great.
"Only Blue"?
- "Almost Blue"
- Yeah.
That's a great song.
Well, that's Mr. Costello.
I don't know.
Everything you do--
Guess I'm makin'
a perfect ass of myself
Yeah, I guess so.
What would you think
if I sort of hung out?
You know, like
hung out with you.
Made myself useful.
I could do that.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Wouldn't have to be--
You know, I mean, that's not why.
Then why?
I didn't mean to offend you.
I have the highest
respect for you.
I have beer brought up to have the
highest respect for women. Very much so.
- How old are you?
- Twenty-three.
- What's your name?
- Axel.
Well, I'm gonna have
a drink, Axel.
Would you like one?
Don't drink.
You're a very nice person, Axel.
Thank you.
- Sorry hon.
- It's all right, Bobby.
Why'd you leave me Bobby?
She's not gonna get sick
in the Rabbit, is she?
It's the fuckin' Nyquil, man.
Don't get pissed at me.
Don't get sick in the Rabbit,
okay, Sadie?
She just slid down the wall, you know?
Passed out. Nothin' major.
To your right.
I'm with her.
You know I love you, Bobby.
'Cause you taught me to listen
to the bottom. Bass and drums, man.
-Shut up, Sadie.
- Don't play it. Don't lie it.
If you're gonna do it, be it.
Try it.
Don't you wish
you'd said it, Sadie?
Don't cut me loose, Bobby.
I'll disappear.
- Do yourself a favor.
- What kind of thing is that to say?
- You used to be able to get my
clothes off. -Shut up, Sadie.
Shit.
You know what, Sadie?
- Got the flu, Bobby.
- It's true man. She's burnin' up.
I told her, you know, she shouldn't mess
around, but she had the gig and everything.
So I think it's okay
to deliver groceries.
You know.
I've done a lot of things.
I've done a lot worse.
But I have my whole life
ahead of me.
My love is cars.
I fix vintage cars.
I think there's where my future is.
Very much so.
- You take me seriously?
- Yeah.
I do, Axel.
I'm young but I know what love is.
I miss love.
I miss it.
I had a really great lady.
She gave up everything for me.
She followed me to Chicago.
We lived there together two years.
Twenty-four hours a day.
Then one day, she said, "That's it.
We aren't anymore?"
She went back to Minnesota.
I never heard from her again.
I'm sorry, Axel.
See, I know if
it's really love that...
You try to work it out
if it's goin' wrong.
So maybe it wasn't love.
I had these goals about gettin' to know myself
better so I'm not so dependent on love.
There's a lot of unkindness
in the world.
You know your--
your life, your day?
They could be the most important part.
One day could be the most important thing in your life.
You'd never know it.
I think, you know,
you're good for me.
I walk into a club, and there's
this beautiful girl smilin' at me.
Singin' to me.
And these shinin'
eyes... at me.
She makes me real.
She gives me reality... so,
I'm in love.
- Whoo!
- Thank you very much.
- Well, I'm glad you made it.
- I had to see you.
-This is Axel.
- Hey, Axel.
Hi. That was great.
Yeah, the band was hot tonight.
I want you to give my best to Bobby.
You guys are workin'.
Doin' good, yeah.
Hey, you know who came by
the backstage? Georgia.
Really? When?
It was Wednesday.
We were workin' Wednesday and Thursday.
Yeah, it was Wednesday.
Did I just screw around
with a can of worms here?
- No. - 'Cause if it's open,
you know, I'll step in it.
- You know we opened for Georgia.
- I heard.
Yeah. In Austin and Eugene...
And Winnipeg.
So she came by, and they were
just comin' off the ceiling.
You know, I don't think she'd feel
too good steppin' in your light.
Fuck you very much, Jo.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in here.
No, come in, Mish.
It's all right.
I was just--
I don't know what I was just.
- Everybody's looking for you.
- Thank you for finding me.
You are so like your mother.
Two peas in a pod.
And your grandfather.
Three peas in a pod.
I'm like my dad, I think.
The table looks great, Mish.
You know what's so good
about us, Georgia?
We're so close.
Growing up, I can't remember
not doing everything together.
- Are you okay?
-I'm fine.
What are you doing
with Axel, Sadie?
- How do you and Dad find so
much to talk about? - We don't.
- We don't talk much.
- I'm going to marry him.
His grandmother's ring.
- And there's only one Jake.
- How old is he, Sadie?
- He loves me.
- I'm gonna stay out of this.
So what is it that happens
between you when you don't talk?
- Leave Dad alone.
- I do.
I do. That's what I do.
- Will you come to the wedding?
- Sure. Okay.
- I'm going to do it.
- Fine.
You know I watch you,
and I listen to you.
This gift from God.
And I swell up with
admiration and pride...
And love.
And I swear on Mish and Andrew...
There's no enemy.
You know, I can't.
And here I am,
not three feet away from you,
and I talk to you...
And I swear, Georgia,
it feels like no one's home.
You disappear on me.
You know what I truly
want for you, Sadie?
I want you to be happy.
You wanna be
trouble-free, Georgia.
Okay. All right.
How you comin' with
the table, Mish?
- Finished. - Why don't you see
if anyone needs anything?
Things are goin' good for me.
I'm glad.
- You know his last name?
- Axel?
- Yeah. Of course.
-Yeah?
Yeah. What do you think?
- You writing?
- Every day.
-Workin' on an album?
- Yes.
I should do some backup.
If you want.
Good idea.
You haven't come to hear me.
Why is that?
- I will if you want.
- It'd be great if you did.
-Well, I will then.
- Okay, great.
I'm interesting, you know?
You were the one with ambition, Sadie.
I never gave a damn.
You say.
You know it's the truth.
Funny how things work out.
Not what I meant.
You know, I let you talk to me this way, and
I manage to make myself think it's okay.
And I'm always glad
you've been here.
And I can't stand it
when you're hurting.
And I've made peace with--
That nothing's enough for you.
I don't want to know what you do locked
away in that bathroom for half an hour.
I don't want my kids to know.
I wouldn't do that
in your house, Georgia.
Okay.
This is a wonderful home.
It's very warm.
You must be very happy here.
Sadie and Georgia
grew up in this house.
Georgia bought it
when it came on the market.
How you doin', Dad?
- I'm doin' all right.
- It's good to see you.
You oughta get out more, Dad.
Well, I get out almost more
than I like anymore.
How you doin', Sadie?
I couldn't be better.
- This is your young man?
- Yes.
Good for you.
- Axel delivers groceries.
- I specialize in vintage cars.
So you've given us to understand.
Is that your, uh,
vehicle out there?
That's my treasure.
Very much so.
Well, I wish you both
every happiness, Axel.
You're a peach, Dad.
- I meant to do that.
- It doesn't matter.
What do you say
we get married, Axel?
Yeah. See, I thought
that's what we were doin'.
I've been with
a lot of men, Axel.
Is there anyone
I supposed to be approved by?
- "Approved by"?
- To meet. Family.
I don't think so. I mean, it's not like
you have to meet 'em right away.
-Axel Goldman, right?
- Yeah.
See. I know it.
Hello. My name
is Sadie Flood.
That's all, my fan.
I got married today.
Thank you.
My husband, Axel.
Thank you, Axel.
So everybody buy another pitcher
of beer because we need the gig.
My sister's here
tonight, everybody.
And we're gonna do one of her songs!
You wanna come up and
do it with us, Georgia?
- Georgia!
- Georgia!
My sister! The single person
I'll miss when I leave this earth.
Do this.
So do you write, too, Sadie?
You do your own songs?
I don't write songs.
That whole concept's foreign to me.
I make 'em up. I put down the words
sometimes to remember 'em, but...
You know.
We're gonna have to go.
And don't get up.
Congratulations. See ya.
- That was a nice thing you did.
- Didn't know I had a choice.
- I thought it was pretty terrific.
- And there's a reporter there.
I mean, what's that all about?
What's runnin' through her head?
- It was a good thing you did, Georgia.
- I feel bad for Axel.
"I don't write.
I make them up."
She didn't even say it. It's not even hers.
I mean, it belongs to someone else.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing--
I'm tired, that's all.
She swallows people up.
- How do you not see it?
- I think she's an original...
And brave and without malice.
Fine.
- She shouldn't sing.
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Yet another casualty.
- Another casualty!
- Pays the rent.
- Pays the rent.
Pays the rent.
- Are you fucked up?
- Hell, no.
Hell, no.
-Hi.
- Hi. Hello.
You wanna bring your gear around back,
someone'll meet you back there.
Hello. My name is Sadie.
-Hi.
- Okay. Thanks.
Don't fuck around.
We gotta cut you loose.
Yeah, uh, that's what you said.
That's what you said.
You're fucked up
all the time, Herman.
I had Thursday down for the gig,
and I don't know how I got Thursday--
It's not Thursday anymore, Herman.
Thursday came and went.
This stuff is making you stupid.
Yeah. You think so?
- So you all decided this together?
- Yeah.
Not me.
Leland and Paul and Clay,
we're tryin' to be in a business here.
We're not 23 anymore.
We at least gotta show up. I mean,
our drummer's gotta show up, Herman.
I don't have a clue
how I missed it, Bobby.
It's not the first time, H.
It's not the tenth time.
So... okay.
Yeah.
Don't be a stranger, okay?
I love you guys.
- All right, see you around, then.
- Take it easy, Herman.
Well, that sucked pretty good.
You guys would tell me if you
were lookin' for a new backup singer.
- Come on, Sadie.
- You wouldn't you fuckers.
You wouldn't, would you?
Come on, Sadie.
Give it up.
What's your fucking problem?
Why do we have to turn this
into your loss, huh?
Goddamn it, don't answer me.
Don't say anything.
I wanna run through the set.
It's nice. It's neat.
It's-- You know, it's what Bobby
had to do, you know. I understand.
I'd have done the same thing.
Done the same thing, yeah.
This stuff'll kill ya
a lot quicker than smack.
You can go a lot of years
doin' smack, barring accident.
Chety was 58.
Art was 60 or something.
Lady Day made it to her forties.
It's not gonna be
a love affair with me...
'cause I know it's
a real hard kick.
Alcohol’s a bad shit man.
It's a real bring-down.
Those guys did everything, though.
Did you ever try
morning glory seeds?
What are you gonna do, H?
Didn't you think Bobby
was gonna go the distance?
I thought he was gonna go
the whole nine yards.
You know, Bobby's a poet.
He's an artist.
When you see desperation
in the eyes, it's a bad sign.
It gets to about payin' the rent.
What are you gonna do, H?
I can always get a gig.
Don't you think so?
I-I been lookin'
to get out of Seattle.
But I'm afraid to leave
my connection you know?
Every time I go out of town,
it's a disaster.
In Chicago, I went downtown
to see where to score,
and I see these three
big, huge black guys...
with guns in their pants.
And I knew all that was gonna happen
was I was gonna get robbed.
I moved to New Orleans.
Tried to do it there.
Got robbed.
I knew I was gonna get robbed,
and I got robbed.
Then I--
You know I used a detox
to get off the street.
My sister's always good
for a few bucks.
Mmm, she's not gonna
put me up forever.
I-I don't wanna be
on the street, man.
It's not my bag.
I th--I thought, you know,
I could teach.
Yeah?
So you and Axel doin' okay?
You makin' out?
He has a car to work on.
Every so often.
He's in paradise.
And his mom sends him
a little somethin', regular.
He's a neat guy, Axel.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Axel's a prince.
Axel's a saint.
Everybody now.
Axel. I told them
to bring you in the studio.
Yeah, I know
I don't like to disturb.
It's not my nature.
How you doin' Jake?
-All right.
- Hey, you.
- Hello, Axel.
- Hey, you, Axel.
-What's up, Axel?
- Everything's great.
- Oh. -Georgia, you think
I could have a minute?
Could I have a few minutes with Georgia, Jake?
No offense.
- No offense, Axel.
-I mean, if you're takin' a break, you know.
- I know. Sure.
- You wanna take a walk?
So you think spring'll get here?
- I think you can count on it.
- I think it's been delayed.
Mechanical difficulties.
So you guys don't call a lot. You come into town.
You know, like, you don't always call.
Well, there's not
always time, you know.
You're not always home,
and we have to get back, and--
Well, I understand.
Very much so.
She sort of knows when you're
in town, that's all. It comes up.
She doesn't call me either, Axel.
When's the last time
you came out to the house?
She's not with Bobby anymore.
It was like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
You know, they had this history and everything.
It kept gettin' in the way.
Sadie gets in the way, Axel.
So, she's been sittin' in around town,
and she jams when she can.
- You could help her.
- Like how, Axel?
- You could do somethin' for her.
- Like what, Axel?
Honestly.
It's just breakin' my heart, that's all.
She's full of hope. She's full of hope.
You know what she's like.
Sometimes it gets too harsh, you know?
You know, no offense.
You're her sister.
You know, when you offer her money,
she takes the money--
and God knows, we could use it--
but she takes it really
not to offend you.
I think you don't know that.
Maybe you do know that.
Maybe I don't know
what I'm talkin' about.
I hate this, don't you?
It's freezing.
Wanna get some coffee
or something?
Steven Soles.
The band is String fellow.
Allright, Georgia!
Georgia!
You wanna shoot some pool?
You got hours, whole hours.
I gotcha.
It's gonna be all right.
One, two, three.
Nice shot.
Your lady's got a touch, Axel.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
I think we should start back.
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be sensational.
Who did this?
Did you do this?
Georgia did this.
- Why don't you hot have that?
- This is to you.
For always being Jake.
The only thing I ever
envied my sister.
This is to you and tonight.
- And tonight.
- Yeah.
Georgia's pregnant.
Oh?
God!
Well, that's so great!
- It's pretty great.
- It's a knockout.
It's a very special privilege for me
to bring Sadie Flood out here tonight.
Seattle's home.
We're gonna kick the shit
out of this thing!
Put it to bed, baby.
It's incredible
for me to be here,
on this stage with my sister.
The single person I'll miss
when I leave this earth. Yeah.
How sweet this is.
The only thing that has any meaning
is what's real, right?
What we get?
What we give each other?
In the dark, we're all scared.
We're all scared.
And there's more of us
out there all the time, man.
And the song is from Van Morrison.
Thank you! God bless.
You were real good.
Keep drinkin'.
Round the edges.
I love you.
I love you, Georgia.
- Want me to drive?
- No, I don't want you to drive.
I take it that you're angry with me.
You took her to a bar,
got her juiced up, got you juiced up.
Why would that bother me?
She was wound up tight. She was
gonna come boppin' off the walls.
Well, you fixed that.
Did you seriously think that she had
no other access to a bottle...
Or whatever else she wanted
before she got there?
I don't need to be right, Georgia.
I don't think I could ever grasp--
I mean, not a clue--
what it's like to be your sister.
Ever so sorry about that.
Very much so.
Thank you Jake.
I whipped your ass at pool.
- Yup.
- I whipped his ass.
- Where are we going?
- To the house.
Ah. Right.
Family weekend.
So, was I great or was I great?
I wish I'd been there.
- You were there.
- Or was I just okay?
You could hear a pin drop.
You were great.
I thought that you were somethin'.
Ha!
What did Sissy think?
Ooh. Stern silence.
Georgia was embarrassed of me.
For me.
Which?
Georgia needed
to help me out up there.
Didn't you, Georgia?
See, I thought I was doin' fine,
but my sister...
Couldn't leave it alone.
For fear of what?
For fear of fucking what,
Georgia?
Did I need saving, Georgia?
How good did it feel
to be able to pull me out?
It felt like a thousand pounds
of dead weight, Sadie.
Is that what you wanna hear?
I don't want this anymore Sadie.
I want you to let go of me.
Let go of me!
Please! Please, Sadie!
Do whatever you have to do, but I
don't want to be a part of it anymore.
I can't do it.
- I don't wanna do it.
- Georgia.
Right.
- Sadie! Sadie.
- Good Sadie.
- You wanna get out? Do you wanna get out, Sadie?
- Georgia.
- Georgia!
- What do you wanna do?
This is entirely up to you, Sadie.
This rig's hot big enough
for the both of us.
You're welcome to spend the night,
you and Axel.
What do you wanna do, Sadie?
We're in the middle of nowhere.
How long were you
prepared to sit here?
-Thanks, guys. Night.
- Night, Sadie.
- Night, Sadie.
- Night.
Well.
- Can I fix you somethin'?
- No, sweetie.
- It's no trouble.
- No, baby.
- You scared of me, Axel?
- No.
Gotta go home for a while.
-Chicago?
- Yeah. For a while.
I'll come with you.
Well, you know, maybe you
could come later, you know?
You takin' a hike, Axel?
No.
'Cause it's all right.
I don't think my mom's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'll be back.
Hard to know how long right?
I can send for ya.
This must've taken you
days, Axel.
I can. I can send for ya.
I'm 23, Sadie.
Try to cut me some slack.
How 'bout a blowjob instead?
Fuck you, Sadie.
Didn't mean it. I swear.
I do everything
I know how for you.
I know, Axel.
You gonna be all right?
Yes.
- I'm not leaving you.
- No.
No such luck, all right?
Send for me, Axel.
- I got back.
- Did you meet Brian?
- Yes.
- D'you know Georgia Flood, Brian?
- This is her sister.
- Oh. Uh, well, it's good to meet ya.
- I'm a big fan. - She sang
with Trucker, too. Didn't you?
How's the world
treatin' you, Sade?
Well, we're tryin'
to come to terms.
You and the world?
That would be a shame.
- I'm a married woman.
- What, you?
Yes, me. Yes, me.
Well, congratulations.
- So how you doin'?
-The same.
Things are about to break.
I'm not a homosexual, Brian.
Did she tell you
I was a homosexual?
- No.
- Sadie's little joke.
- Did you get another cat?
- No.
Yeah. Well, I tried a dog.
You can rely on a dog,
but I couldn't train him.
Messed all over the apartment.
He shit. He pissed.
So damned dependent, dogs.
I need a gig, place to stay.
Let me look into it, okay?
Yeah, well, a place to stay.
Yeah, I'll look into it.
What kind of answer is that?
You're my manager, right?
Whatever the hell that means.
Where were you for me to manage?
I don' remember seeing ten percent
for the months at a time you were gone.
It's not the money, Sadie.
I always thought you had the goods.
I appreciate talent.
I put myself at the line.
You want work and time to pay off.
I'm not above getting hurt.
So if I'm not in total rapture
at seeing you,
you'll understand.
You are so
full of shit, Chasman.
The other day man,
I couldn't find the door.
-Shit.
- I swear
I couldn't find the goddamn door.
No fucking shit.
You know where is the door
to this apartment...
Like the back of my hand.
And I can't find the door.
Did you lose Brian?
Brian found the door.
Guess so.
Well, I'm game. Fuck it.
We'll check ourselves in.
Detox.
We'll go to L.A. You've gotta
make it in L.A. to mean anything.
- Yeah.
-We'll clean up.
Yeah.
Don't touch my wake-up.
Want to find it right there
in the morning.
Do you have a prepaid ticket here
for Sadie Flood?
For Seattle. The 11:30?
I'm not showing anything.
Flight 4847
I don't know.
I'm in Medford, right?
The 11:30.
I'm not showing anything.
Yeah, well, maybe you could call.
As soon as it was prepaid,
they'd have put it in the computer.
It would show up
on the computer.
I'm sick, see?
There was supposed
to be a wheelchair.
So, uh, maybe you
could call someone.
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll see what I can do.
- Yeah well-
- There's another flight at 2:35.
I'm not on this plane, I'm outta here.
It's a medical emergency.
-I'm sick, and--
-How long ago was the ticket purchased?
I don't know.
Hour. Half-hour.
Look, do you have a supervisor?
I gotta be on the plane.
I'm sick, see?
What's your name?
Why don't you sit down
and let me see what I can do?
I really need to take care of
the rest of these people.
Okay, Helen.
Who do you have to fuck
to get some help around here?
<i>Rollinger, Munson, Okeson and Rice</i>
<i>to the boarding doorway
gate C-2 for departure.</i>
You can't get on the plane
without shoes, miss. You have shoes?
Are you kidding me?
It's an airline
regulation, miss.
It's a medical emergency.
I have to get to a hospital.
- I'm sorry ma'am.
- You're not gonna let me board?
We can't let anybody board
without shoes, ma'am.
Shit. Fucking horseshit, man!
Anybody got a pair of shoes?
This is a medical emergency.
Anybody got a pair of shoes
so I can get on a goddamn plane?
Please?
Anybody wanna give me a pair of shoes
to get on this fucking plane, please?
Thank you.
<i>The arrival of flight
484 at 12:37 from Medford, Oregon.</i>
<i>All those arriving passengers
can be met momentarily at gate R-54.</i>
Hi.
- I'm sorry.
- Your flight was early.
Twenty minutes, yeah.
I thought Jake would come.
No, I wanted to come get you.
So how'd you find me in here?
I left my bag outside.
- I'm really sick, Georgia.
- Let's get your stuff
- Look at you. You told 'em not
to let me die, right? - Yeah.
-You know what I mean?
- Yes.
Thank you.
I didn't know who else to call.
I'm so sorry, Georgia.
They weren't gonna let me
on the plane.
This kid was great.
Well, I'm thin, huh?
You're not gonna be able to find a vein.
Why don't you let me do that?
I think I've got this
under control.
She’s gonna be okay.
We're gonna be giving her high doses
of Valium so she doesn't seize.
And he'll give her Clonidine patches
for the heroin.
You go home and rest. She'll pretty
much sleep the next couple of days.
This is probably
inappropriate, but...
I'm a really big fan.
What are you doin' here, Dad?
I don't want you here, Dad.
Really not.
This is my party.
Where's my sweetheart?
Who?
This guy I was sleeping with.
He left me.
- She awake?
- She wants a cigarette.
I'm sorry about the robe.
I really love this robe.
I don't care about the robe.
It's yours.
Make sure she's sitting up
while she's smoking
Don't nod out on us, Sadie.
We're very proud of this girl.
She's come a really long way.
She's the best nurse on the ward.
You are, huh?
They hate me here.
They do.
So this must be
a real embarrassment to you.
No. Why?
Cry all the time.
The patches make me a little--
You know.
- Well, you see.
- How's it goin'?
Lots of paperwork.
It's all paperwork.
And meetings. Meetings.
I'm having some trouble with
the God-as-I-understand-Him part.
What was Dad doing here?
-Dad?
- Really.
I don't think so.
Right there in that chair.
I like my counselor. David.
Donald.
-Which?
- David.
Donald.
David Donald.
I think that's his name.
Do you want me to call Axel?
Oh, God. Axel.
Sweet Axel.
Axel needs to get a life.
So when do you think
you're gonna have this baby?
I don't know.
Can I?
It's so amazing.
Did I tell you about Stewart?
- The one who designed speakers.
- For concerts.
- He was in love with you.
- Yeah.
- You mean Sam.
-Sam?
Yeah.
Did I tell you about Sam?
Ow.
You look good.
You too.
- They had to see if I was approved.
- Yeah.
I make a list.
Like I'm in control here.
So how is it?
It's great. Yeah.
Real people.
So how you doin'?
You know. Survival.
And Bobby?
Seattle's own, huh?
- Say hello.
- Sure.
I did it myself.
- It was driving me crazy.
- They let you have scissors?
Yeah. Scissors.
So you think I look okay?
You look great.
I miss you guys.
- Yeah, me too.
-I miss Herman.
Yeah, me too.
I could've called that.
- What?
- Uh, shit.
I'm sorry.
A month, month and a half ago.
Fuckin' Herman.
Good job, Druid.
I can't afford to go
to Mardi Gras this year.
I don't even care about payin'
my phone bill, know what I mean?
My mind gets up
five minutes before I do.
And then it's sitting on the bed.
Saying "I've been waiting for you.
"I have something to say to you
"I've been wanting to talk to you"
My mind says
"I've been awake all night
"I just want you to know
you have Cancer."
"You're on the verge of bankruptcy.
"Nobody likes you."
Overriding doom.
- It's a mind fuck.
- Andrew.
He's all right.
- You're goin' all touchy-feely, Andrew
- I don't mind.
I'm sure not.
Bray Hammond Kiley.
That's a lot of weight.
My mother's father's name.
- It'll keep him grounded
- One would hope.
- You didn't come visit.
- No, I didn't, but I love you just the same.
I hold a very special place
for you, Sadie.
Do you, Jake?
Yeah. A sacred place.
Well,
You've only ever been
the only man in the world, Jake.
Yes.
-Yes? You sure?
- Yes. Mm -hmm.
I don't wanna take it unless it
was goin' to Goodwill anyway.
You're in my closet, Sadie.
You can have anything
you like, really. Yours.
Don't do that.
Don't do what?
Take what you need.
What are you doin'?
Nothing. My favorite thing.
Mish has got the ticket.
She can become weightless.
Thin air. It's something
I'm apt to encourage.
Are you gonna need money?
- Not a lot.
- It's not a bottomless pit, Sadie.
Well, Sis... I know that, Sis.
I'm keepin' accounts.
You didn't know that.
You're so funny, Sadie.
- You haven't asked my plans.
- No, I haven't.
Do you care?
I knew you'd tell me.
Uncertain. I think L.A.
I think in stages.
Oh, good.
- Good what?
- I don't know, Sadie.
As long as you're okay.
I was just thinkin', you know?
You never left home, Georgia.
I guess so.
I must scare the shit out of you.
I must be your worst nightmare.
Sadie's out there gobbling it up.
Always. That's always
how I see you.
Gabbling it up again.
I hate the desperation.
Everything's so desperate.
Yeah. Well, you don't do
anything desperate.
You don't feel
anything desperately.
It's not in your nature.
Feeling isn't your
strong suit, Georgia.
No, not like you.
- Nothing consuming.
- No.
- Not passion.
- Passion?
Okay, passion.
-Or pain.
- No. Or suffering.
That's a gift you mistake
for voice, Sadie.
My God. It's how
you define yourself.
It's yours. I'll give you that.
Sadie's pain has to be fed,
goddamn it.
Kept alive.
And we're all here
ready to serve.
You don't sing Sadie.
You can't sing.
You wish.
My name's Sadie Flood.
And we're gonna come to terms,
Portland, okay?
This is my harp player
and my guitar player, Mark Olsen.
- And my drummer--
- What? - Joey.
Joey Denizzioni.
- Joey. What?
- Denizzioni.
Joey Denizzioni on the drums.
And Guy Davis on bass.
Thank you.
No one does that song
better than my sister.
Who? Thank you, comrade.
