Hey, Tobe!
- What?
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.
- Can I come?
I kinda rather be alone.
Let me come.
- You don't even know
where I'm going. - I don't care.
Okay.
Just don't bother me.
You can't even spit!
Cigarette helps.
Here.
But don't inhale it, just
hold the smoke in your mouth.
Hold it...
Hold it...
Okay, blow it out.
See?
He picks up his bolt,
it's like pretty big,
walks over to where I am,
and he stick his hand
off the fence. - Wade's here!
Hang on a sec.
Anyway, the fool
sticks his hand out
and drops it down,
can you imagine?
He smashed the windshield
of a passing car!
Hello!
<i>- Anyone home?</i>
- Hold on.
Did anyone ever
teach you to knock?
I'll start knocking
when you start working.
I'll see you later.
I need you to Get dinner for you
and Lonnie tonight, I'm going out.
I can't, April's coming, and in
15 minutes I have to get ready!
She can wait.
I've been with Lonnie all day,
I just wanna go out.
15 minutes wont kill you.
Get chicken for him,
and you can have the rest.
- Will you be okay
on your own? - Yeah.
Can I?
I told you i don't want you
sleeping in Tobe's room.
Can't you just...
sleep in your own room
with the light on?
I thought I saw someone
outside my window.
Well, if there really is
someone outside your window,
then come and get me.
You told me not to bother you.
Well, don't if it's
just a shadow.
- I'll be right there!
<i>- You're a knockout!</i>
- You're going to school like that?
- It's spring break.
All you kids ever get is breaks,
no wonder you have
no idea about anything.
- Where are you going?
- To the beach.
Hold on!
- What?
- Don't stay out so late again.
Okay.
Put a shirt on!
She's 18, who gets
fake tits at 18?
- That's fucking disgusting.
- No, I think she looks better.
- She feels better too. - Right,
all the guys looking at her now.
I say she's such a bitch.
Yeah, she's a skank!
Does he work here?
- Oh, my God, what a weirdo!
Be quiet!
- Howdy.
- Howdy!
What can I do for you'll?
You can fill it up
with unleaded, Tex.
Will do.
- He said "howdy"...
- Oh my gosh, he's pathetic.
Knock it off, Jeremy.
Tex, can you check the oil?
Yeah, I'm gonna
do your windows too.
Great, a real cowboy.
We promise you guys full service,
so we got to give full service.
- Are you for real?
- What?
Are you for real?
I think so.
Wanna get a squeeze?
Yeah!
He's real!
- Can you believe it!
- In the flesh...
- You touched the cowboy.
- How cool!
How's the oil?
All right.
The belt's a bit ragged up.
How far you are going?
- Just going to the beach.
- Really?
That's nice, I've never
been to the beach.
How long have you lived here?
Not too long.
You can drive there
in like less than an hour.
I can't, I don't have a car.
How come?
How come I don't have a car?
I don't like 'em...
they make you lazy.
Pretty funny place to work
if you don't like cars.
Ain't that the truth,
you gotta make a living.
So what about this fanbelt?
It should get you there.
Have a good time.
Hey...
Do you wanna come?
With you to the beach?
Kind of.
You actually got to work, so...
You know what,
let me see about that.
Hold on.
Can we go?
I invited Tex to the beach.
- I can't believe it!
- Are you nuts?
- What are you thinking?
- Maybe he's a psychopath.
- Is he coming or not?
- I'm waiting for my change still.
Get lost!
Is that offer for real?
Yeah.
Did you get off work?
- Sort of...
- Sort of?
He said I could go,
but if I go, don't come back.
Why would you wanna do that?
I wanna see the beach with you.
Ok.
Come on, then.
- So, what's your name?
- Harlan.
Just Harlan?
My full name is Harlan
Fairfax Carruthers...
That's definitely full...
- What's your name?
- Tobe.
Tobe short for, what, Toby?
Tabitha?
Tobias?
Manitoba?
October.
October, really?
It's pretty.
- It's nice to meet you all.
- Likewise, do you smoke?
Is that weed?
I don't touch
any of that stuff.
Where are you from?
- South Dakota.
- Really?
I knew some dudes
from South Dakota,
but they weren't
anything like you!
That's okay too.
Tell you what. When I woke up
this morning I didn't think I would
end up looking at the ocean.
Wanna go in?
- In there?
- Yes.
I like looking at it,
I ain't planning on drowning.
I'll protect you.
I don't got the right clothes
for an ocean swim.
Just go in your underwear,
like the Mexicans do.
I don't know about that.
Then just go in your pants.
These jeans could
use a wash, you know.
C'mon.
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it'll be fun, I promise.
Gimme your hand.
Here it comes!
Are we too far out?
You okay?
We ain't gonna drift
out to sea, are we?
Don't worry, I won't
let you drown.
It's about as close to
forever as I could imagine.
Don't look out there,
just look at me.
Holy smoke.
See?
Should have gone
to the beach sooner?
What time is it?
Dunno, it's late.
It's early almost.
I'd better go.
My dad is gonna kill me.
Well i hope not,
then I couldn't take you out.
You wanna take me out?
Yes, sure I mean,
this was fine,
but this isn't
the proper way to meet.
You're so funny.
Hey, how do you do?
I'm Harlan, what's your name?
Lonnie.
Glad to meet you.
Hell, I didn't
mess that up, did I?
No, you just
got to crank it up.
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
That's classic, isn't it?
I never seen one of
those that work.
- Are you my dad's friend?
- Huh? No...
I'm here to take your sister...
Go out.
We're going downtown.
Is that all right with you?
Yes.
Okay.
You're Tobe's
little brother, yeah?
- What are you like, 11 or 12?
- 13.
Are you 13, really?
Sorry...
- I'll get bigger.
- Yeah!
I don't mean...
Yeah.
I was smaller than you,
when I was your age.
I had an uncle who said
I was like a tree twig,
said I was gonna get
blown away in a strong wind.
I was real small!
Till I grew up.
- Where's Tobe?
- She's getting...
How do I look?
Oh, man!
Look at you!
- It fits you out.
- It's perfect.
- Do i look pretty in it?
- Yes.
You're so pretty.
You wanna get a bite to eat?
We'll take your little brother,
before we go dancing.
Hey, wanna go get a burger
with us, or something?
All right,
let's do it!
Hey, dad.
Hey.
- This is Harlan.
- Nice to meet you, sir.
Wade.
- Where'd you get that dress?
- Harlan got it for me.
- What?
- It's nothing.
I haven't seen you in a dress
since you were 13.
That's a shame isn't it, a girl
as  beautiful as your daughter.
What's your line, Harlan?
I...
I'm in the middle of figuring
that out right now.
But i have a background
in ranching.
Not much ranching around here.
Not that much anymore, but
anyway you would be surprised
how those skills apply
on a lot of other areas.
You're right, I would be.
We're gonna go take Lonnie out for
a burger, then we're gonna go out.
As long as that's
okay with you, sir.
I guess.
Well?
Sir, I wanna tell you I got
real admiration for your daughter.
She's got a great spirit...
I hope to earn your trust.
Let's go.
Who is that guy?
- I met him at the beach.
- You met him at the beach?
- I gotta go.
- No, hold on.
- You worked on a ranch?
- Yeah, sure did.
Where?
In South Dakota?
Yeah, back there a little.
Out here more.
There are still
ranches out here?
They got a few.
Most of them were cut out
or sold off, but...
- You like animals?
- Yes.
Yeah?
Well, if you're interested...
we can go and check out one of
these big farms in the North Valley.
I don't mean one of
those tourist traps,
I mean a real working place,
what do you say?
Yes.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Is that kid okay?
- Who, Lonnie?
- Yes.
Yes, why?
Dunno, he seems kinda...
I dunno, like he needs
some fresh air, or...
like he needs...
something.
He's still really
scared of the dark.
He has to sleep
with the light on.
I could barely sleep
with the lights off!
Anyway...
he's okay.
Plus, I look after him.
You're a good girl.
I mean it.
You have a good heart.
April!
Look who's here!
I wanna do this with you,
it'll make us happy.
I'm already happy with you.
Not like this.
Let's go!
Hold on, be right there.
Hey, man.
Window's open, what
are you all doing?
Where's the cowboy?
What are you doing,
John Wayne? C'mon!
You gotta love people, not cars.
I'm serious!
What are you doin'?
You don't belong in there,
you belong out here.
We'got places to go.
Look!
- Everyone out!
- The hell with cars!
- Hug me!
- No, you do it.
- Preach it, Texan!
- Yeah, I'll preach!
Preach it, brother.
See, I'm preaching!
- Stop that.
- What?
- Are you crazy?
- No, I'm the sanest of all.
- Yeah, right.
- It's true, look.
They're sitting
in their boxes driving.
Look how many boxes,
an endless line!
How long does this last?
For a while.
You wont feel it tomorrow.
What are you thinking?
Dunno,
there are lots of things
I'd wanna do, but...
I'll never get to do them.
You can do anything
you want to do.
You can even be anybody
you wanna be if you just...
Decide and...
do it.
It's like waiting
for life to start.
A new start, you know?
Most days I just wanna
step outside of my heart.
Go walk under a sky
full of stars.
And hear nothing but the wind.
And when I do speak I want it
to be with my true voice.
- Do you think you talk
with your real voice? - Dunno.
How do I know it?
Cause you don't hear other voices
in your head while talking.
Till things you really
wanna be saying,
you don't say things
that don't matter to you.
Are you true with yourself?
Not very often.
But I do right now.
Me too.
- Hi. - Where the fuck
have you been?
I slept at April's.
Wait a goddamn minute!
What happened to the guy?
I was up all night
worried sick about you.
- I am sure your friend kept your
mind out of it? - Come here!
- I'm not done talking.
- Leave me alone.
Come out!
- Open the door.
- No fucking way!
Open the damn door.
We're gonna talk
about this tonight,
and you be here
when I get home.
- Hear me?
- Yes.
- What?
- Yes!
You got something
in there that is mine,
I ain't gonna give it up cheap!
If I come in,
I'm coming in hot!
You got some nerve
shooting at me.
Half that is mine,
there's plenty for everyone!
<i>Knock it off, will you!</i>
Keep it down yourself!
You think I like listening to
your game shows all day.
<i>You have something
wrong with you!</i>
It's greed that it's gonna
be the death of you,
'cause you...
You are greedy little pig,
and you'll squeal like a pig
when I come through that door!
<i>Fuck.</i>
All over for a few lumps of ore.
I guess this is just
the human falling.
Almost there.
- These the ones?
- Them all right.
You like 'em?
Well...
which one you want.
Hey, there.
Good boy.
Come on.
What do you think?
It's beautiful.
Yeah, it still is.
Do you think things
have a purpose?
What do you mean?
Do you think everything's has
something it's supposed to do
or be?
Kind of a nice thought.
I sat here a lot of times.
I looked at this tree and
i wondered if that
branch had a purpose.
Maybe it's here...
to provide shade.
Or maybe...
it'll get cut down to make somebody
a nice piece of furniture someday.
Maybe it's supposed to
have a swing on it.
Maybe it's just here so
the tree can balance itself.
I'd lean towards the swing.
It seems like hopeful to me.
And now i see sitting up there,
I know I'm right.
Can I watch?
Yeah.
Where's your sister?
Dunno.
Are you still mad at her?
Look, I love
your sister, she just...
She gets under my
skin sometimes, okay?
What do you love about her?
I don't know,
she's got gumption.
What's that?
It means...
she has spirit,
she won't take shit.
This drives me crazy but I
know it's good for her.
America's tough on the meek.
But they'll inherit the earth.
- What?
- They'll inherit the earth.
Where did you get that crap.
I heard it on TV.
The meek may inherit fortune
from relatives that dies,
but not the earth.
The only good thing about
the meek is they make...
life easier for those
with grumption.
Can you learn grumption?
No, you either
got it or you don't.
Hold it!
Hey, Charlie, you've
kept him in great shape.
We've been running all day.
Get off him.
- What?
- Get off my horse.
Get off the horse,
you speak English?
Quit fooling around, Charlie,
you're scaring my girl.
You're on my property,
you're on my horse.
If I shot you I would be
well within the law.
- I ain't sure that's technically
correct. - Get off the horse.
It's okay, sweetheart,
we're having some
kind of miscommunication,
we'll work it out.
I don't know what's wrong with
your friend head there, mam,
but you'd better talk him down
off that horse as fast as you can!
Harlan, get down.
All right.
Not getting off cause
of you or your gun,
but 'cause my girl here wants me
to, and I'd do anything for her.
Unlike you, Charlie, I got
my priorities straight.
I don't give a rats ass
about your priorities.
And stop calling me Charlie.
You know what, you
really dissapoint me.
After all our nice
conversations we had,
now you embarrass me
in front of my girl like this?
I should kick your ass
just for that.
Come on, sweet pea,
let's get out of here.
- You're not going anywhere.
- Put the rifle down!
- Put the firearm down.
- They're the thieves.
Thank you, officer. Have you
lost your mind, Charlie?
- Pointing a gun
at your friends? - Easy.
Them are the thieves.
These are the thieves.
Sir, everybody,
what's going on her?
- They stole my horse.
- We didn't steal anything.
The horse is rigt there!
They came on my property,
and they stole a horse
and that guy with the cowboy hat
just threatened me.
What a bullshit?
- Don't you start!
- Take it easy.
- Where's the horse?
- There.
The white one, was stolen
by them without my permission.
- Off my property.
- Wait, officer!
I borrow the horse all the time.
Charlie says it's fine as long
as I bring my own gear.
He wasn't here when we
happen to show up,
so we borrowed the horse, we come
back and now he's flipped on me.
You think this is the Old West?
- This is the goddamn Valley.
- You're the one with the gun!
I don't even know
the guy for Christ's sake.
He takes a lot of medication,
sometimes he get off it,
so he gets like this.
- I don't take medication!
- You gotta take those pills.
- My name isn't Charlie!
- Get them in the car right now.
Have you really met Charlie?
Of course, I told you I did.
You can tell me,
it's all ok.
He says his name
wasn't Charlie.
That? I don't know if he has
another name or something,
I've always called him Charlie.
You mad at me?
Shit!
Great.
I take better care of critters,
a whole lot better than you
take care of your children.
Right.
Tell me exactly what happened.
Sir, I just want to say that...
I understand
if you're upset but...
Tobe had nothing to do with it.
If there was any fault at all
it was definitely mine.
You don't have to apologize.
I think it's important to take
responsability for your actions.
Nothing's more you can ask a
person than take responsability,
how about not breaking
the law with a minor?
Well, yeah, sure.
But that don't apply cause
that wasn't the case.
It was a misunderstanding.
Tobe, tell your friend here...
It'll take a little bit more
honesty to win me over.
- I don't give a shit if he
wins you over! - Hey!
See you, Lonnie.
Thanks a lot.
- Stop!
- Let me go!
You sit down and talk to me!
I don't want to talk to you.
- Let me go!
- Calm down!
Fuck you!
You want me to fuck off, I'm
your fucking goddamn father.
I'm her fucking father.
If I catch you near that nutcase,
I'll break his fucking ass!
Wait, go back in.
- Stop it, dammit!
- Let go!
Get the hell back in!
Tobe, I am sorry.
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You all right?
Get the fuck away!
- What are you doing?
- Knocking on your window.
- What were you doing?
- Sleeping.
How did your window get broke?
It was just an accident.
- Did he get
rough with you? - No.
- You swear?
- Yes.
Did he say anything about me?
He just said he didn't want me
to see you anymore.
- You're not gonna listen
to him, are you? - No way.
Will you come
take a walk with me?
I can't.
There's a religious
parade down the road.
Spanish Lutherans, you've
never seen spirit like that.
I can't, just not tonight.
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- I'm not gonna be here.
I got to go with April
and her parents
to San Diego for the week-end.
- Can I see you Monday morning?
- Yes, but not here.
'Cause of my dad...
- I'll come to see you.
- Okay, what time?
How about 10:02.
- Why so late?
- 10:01?
That'll do.
Crazy cowboy!
You love me?
Yes, now go.
Bye.
<i>"Dear Joe,"</i>

Hey, it's the twig man.
- What's up, buddy?
- Nothing.
- You having a good vacation?
- Yes.
- Is Tobe around?
- No.
- She's not back from her trip?
- Dunno.
Wanna wait for her?
I was waiting for her,
she was...
supposed to come by but...
I am gonna be at my spread,
when she gets home just tell
her to come and see me, okay?
Okay.
See you.
Hey, Harlan.
Wanna see something?
Yeah.
Wow, helluva collection!
Know what this is?
- A 1921 Colt Peacemaker.
- Yep, it's his favorite.
That's a beauty!
- Ever go shooting with him?
- No.
- He says i have to be 16
to touch a gun. - 16?
- Your dad was in the war, huh?
- I guess.
Nice.
Do you have anything today?
So, who is your real father,
if it ain't Wade?
Dunno.
- I never met him.
- So, Wade's it, huh?
Yeah, he pays for
our food and everything.
It takes more than that
to be a father.
Where's your dad?
He left me and my mom
when I was your age.
This right here, is
a single action Colt 45.
They have been making
that gun since 1873.
They haven't made
a single change to it,
because that's the way it is.
Everyone you ever heard of:
Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, all of
them they had a gun like this.
Now, single action,
what that means you can
pull that trigger all day
and it doesn't do nothing.
You have to thumb
that hammer back to fire.
You have to do it every time,
that makes it a little tricky.
That means in the
old days, the gunfighters
they had to draw and cock
and shoot all in one motion.
After a while,
you get used to it.
You want the last two?
Stand here.
When you're ready,
just thumb it back,
let it roll nice and easy.
Be ready it's gonna kick
a little the first time.
Don't even aim, point
as if it were your finger,
as if it were an extension
of you, okay?
Look at that!
That's good stuff!
That's my favorite song.
We can sound allright with
a little more practise.
Tobe's not here.
I don't want her
spending time with you.
I'd have to hear that from her,
before it's okay with me.
Anyway, I wasn't spending time
with Tobe, I was here with Lonnie.
The point is, I don't
want you around here, period.
I know the circumstances
of the other night,
probably don't fit
too right with you.
I'm sure you think
I am a bad influence.
But I ain't.
I have nothing
but good intentions.
I just wish you'd
accept my apology?
You're the honcho, I wouldn't
try to take that from you.
- Okay, it's Harlan right?
- Yes.
Harlan Fairfax Carruthers.
Okay, Harlan, I know you, and
I ain't buying what you're saying.
How do you know
so much about me?
It's my job,
I see your kind every day.
- My kind?
- Yes.
- My kind, what is that?
- Want me to spell it out for you?
- I think you should.
- What you are?
A piece of trailer trash, a nobody
who wishes he was a somebody.
What makes you different,
is you're willing to do something
stupid to reach your goal,
that makes you a menace.
That's why I don't want
you around my kids.
Really...
- Tell me the truth, does
that sounds like me? - No.
- Shut up and go inside. - That
boy has a right to his opinion.
- Go inside.
- He's my friend, he knows me!
Go inside!
- It's ok!
You shut the fuck up and
you go inside! - Hey, hey!
- Hey, don't yell at him.
- Get the fuck inside!
You better talk to me, mister,
cause I am here,
I ain't a nobody, I'm a person.
And I won't leave just 'cause
one son of a bitch don't like me.
I know I'm not important, but
I know how to stand my ground.
For love.
Shit.
I'm sorry, man.
Really sorry.
You should go.
I can't.
I can't do that.
No more. No more.
He's getting his gun!
- That's okay...
You don't got to go here.
We don't have to do this at all.
Get the hell outta here.
You're setting a bad example
for that boy. - Don't!
Am I getting through to you?
Yes, you are getting through.
Getting through, loud and clear.
- You want a bullet or want me to
get out of here? - Get the fuck out.
Okay, put it down,
I'll leave.
You're a real solid kid, don't
let anybody tell you different.
You can't threaten
my friends with a gun!
What right do you have
to do that?
How do I know if he's
some kind of a pervert?
- You're a fucking bastard.
- Watch your fucking mouth!
- Cause you're a fucking
one too. - Really!
Fuck you.
- Let go!
- No, stop it!
Stop it.
Knock it off, I said enough!
All right.
I love him!
Why can't you just
let me love him?
Hi.
Where you've been?
I was worried.
Come sit down.
I'm okay.
I'm sorry for
what he did to you.
Yeah...
It's all right.
Sometimes...
things like this makes it
whole lot clearer.
He said some bullshit,
like you tried to kidnap Lonnie!
I didn't believe him,
he got so crazy.
I brought Lonnie home before
the sun was even down.
Want a donut or
some hot chocolate?
Wait.
Did you really take Lonnie out?
Yeah, I came looking for you.
I was worried when you
didn't show up.
He's there on his own,
he has nothing to do.
I felt bad for him, so I
took him to the wash
and popped a few cans.
You took him shooting?
Why would you do that?
He was all alone, you should've
seen his face, I felt bad for him.
That's not the point. You know
that would piss my dad off!
Yeah...
But...
Look, I had him back
before he got home.
You can't just do
things like that.
Now it'll be even harder
for me to see you.
October...
Are you happy living in
that house with Wade?
I gotta get you out of there.
What?
I gotta get you out of there,
you and Lonnie both.
- I'll take you somewhere else.
- Just stop being so...
- Well, how the...
- Just be cool, okay?!
I am cool as it could be.
Look...
let's just not see
each other for a while.
- No! I don't wanna do that!
- Until things cool off.
- How long will that take?
- I don't know.
Where are you going? Don't go!
I have to go home.
Look...
Everything will be fine, okay?
I'll figure something out,
I promise.
What's your line?
I have a background in...
automotive service and
I'm a fucking cowboy.
What's your line?
Fuck, why ranches.
For real, I'm an Indian.
Yes, an Indian.
The last of the Mohicans.
Why, what's your line?
What's your line...
Wade?
Corrections?
So you're a screwhead?
Yeah, screwhead,
that's what we called you.
Oh, you come from
a long line of screwheads?
I'm from a long line of...
warrior... kings.
You think I am fooling?
See that? That's how it's
gonna look coming at you.
Yeah, who's a nobody now?
I am coming in Harlan?
Harlan, you in here?
What'up, Rene?
Just tell me that's not
a bullet hole in my window.
- Why, I guess it is.
- Have you lost your fucking mind?
- You don't shoot windows
out here! - Go to your room.
- Why does he have a gun anyway?
- Go to your room!
- Are you fucking crazy?
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.
I don't care what it was.
Harlan, you know I like you,
but you never give me any
respect, so you gotta go.
Don't think about it, don't
ponder in that brain of yours,
just pack your stuff and go!
I'm serious, Harlan.
I'm getting my fucking
shit, Rene, all right?!
Last stop.

Okay, get your hands off.

Hi, sweetie.
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?
- Oh, gosh!
- Where have you been?
Around, I didn't...
I had a few things
I had to do.
I was really worried about you,
didn't know where you were.
I thought you didn't want
to see me for a while, so I...
I thought I'd leave you alone.
You didn't have to disappear.
I was upset when
I said those things.
You sure?
You're not mad at me now?
Oh, gosh.
That's all that matters.
Long as we're
sticking together.
Are you okay?
Yes, I...
I know you wouldn't want
me coming around here
I needed to see you,
talk to you about things.
- How did you get in? - I thought
I heard you around the side.
So i wandered around
and the door was open.
I didn't see your dad's truck,
so I thought I could surprise you.
- Let's go for a walk.
- No, come here.
C'mon. No, no. C'mon.
We ain't got time.
What's going on, Harlan?
What do you mean?
Why's my bag out?
Because we're gonna
get out of here.
What are you talking about?
Like I said, I told you I'd
figure something out.
I did, look, look.
It took me a little while,
but I got some
real dough together.
This will take us a long way,
then we could get set up,
take Lonnie in, or whatever
you wanna do, we can do it now.
I packed a few things.
Didn't know exactly
what you'd want,
I was so excited I got
7 of everything.
I didn't find 7 of your bras.
But I put your dress in.
I'm sure there's stuff
you're gonna want,
little things
I don't know about.
Sweetheart, what do you say?
My dad will be here any second,
just go right now.
No, no, no.
Wait, we got time.
Get your stuff, we could
never get a chance.
- Put this back, please.
- Wait, what are you doing?
- My dad sees this he's
gonna kill me. - Wait, stop!
We're gonna be a long way
away before he figures this out.
I told you the other day that
I didn't want to go away!
That wasn't you
talking, I know.
Then who was it?
That was someone else's
voice talking through you.
That was your fear.
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,
so I think you need to go.
- October, listen! Sweetheart.
I know you're scared but we
ain't gonna get another chance.
Look inside you and
listen to your true heart,
listen to what is it telling you.
You know what,
this is my true heart,
this is my true voice,
I want you to go!
- Don't holler at me!
- Well, you're not listening to me!
You need to get out of her,
what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you!
Sweetpea.
Sweetpea, I didn't...
Do you hear me, honey?
Can you hear me?
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
Breathe.
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>
Anyone home?
Tobe?
Lonnie?
Somebody help my daughter!
Somebody help my daughter!
Do you own other
firearms in the house?
Yes, but I keep them all
under a lock and a key.
'Cept for the one.
He must to broken in to it.
Case wasn't broken in into.
Look, he got it somehow!
Did she say anything?
No.
She was already...
She was already
unconscious.
- What about your son?
- No.
Came home after we left.
- Does he have access
to the guns? - No way!
- His fingerprints were
on the gun. - What?
- Could have been an accident.
- No, it wasn't an accident!
Nobody's ever seen
that cowboy person, Wade.
Hey, Twig!
Hey, bud.
Tobe got shot.
Yeah, I know.
- I had a hit too.
- Who did it?
She didn't say
nothing to nobody.
She's in a coma.
It was Wade.
- It was?
- Yes.
I came to see her
and say goodbye.
I was going away,
for a while.
She wanted to come with me.
We were talking and
didn't hear him come home.
He'd come at me with that gun, but
Tobe got in the way so he shot her.
She was trying to protect me
and he shot her!
What kind of a son of
a bitch would do that?
He shot at me too, but I
jumped off the window.
Where did you get shot?
- Does it hurt? - No, it's
just went through the skin.
I'm allright.
My fingerprints were on the gun.
I have to talk to the police
tomorrow morning.
Twig...
I want you to listen to me.
It's best if you grab your things
and come with me right now.
- I can't.
- Yes you can.
Sooner or later
the cops will figure out that it was
your dad who has done this thing.
When they do, they are
gonna lock him away.
Then they will take you
and put you with another family.
- No, they won't.
- Yes, they will.
That's the truth.
You're gonna end up
in a worthless state house.
Do you know what that means?
It's the worst thing
that could happen to a kid.
I don't want that
to happen to you.
If you want to come with me,
I'll take you out of here.
We'll hide out for a while.
When Tobe's better we'll come
down here to get her too.
What do you say, bud?
Wanna go with me?
Yes.
All right.
Then pack a bag
and get me a blanket,
we'll meet in
the back alley, okay.
C'mon, champ.
Mr. Summers.
She's up.
What happened?
You've passed out.
I feel...
really strange.
Where is Lonnie?
This is about as high up
as you can get around here.
Are you crying, bud?
Sorry.
Never be sorry for crying,
ain't no shame in that.
I try not to cry in front
someone i think is against
me, but that's about it.
Is Tobe gonna be okay?
Is that what you're
worried about?
Yeah, she is.
She's gonna be fine.
What's going on?
They're not in here.
Lonnie!
Hey, Lonnie! Lon!
A guy in Santa Corida
spotted him.
His name is Martin Lassen,
he's a local from Receda.
He did a year in Chino
for robbery.
Hey, bud.
C'mon, let's take a walk.
I wanna show you somethin'.
What?
Come on, just trust me.
C'mon.
You hold on that for a while.
Where're you goin'?
I'm right here.
I ain't goin' anywhere.
You there?
Yeay, I'm right with you.
You're ok.
Just work with that pile.
What was that?
That's just another
scared creature like us.
Dont' run.
Move, but don't move
like they're moves.
Move like a panther.
Move confident.
And you will be.
Harlan?
Harlan?
Hey.
Hey.
Where are we?
That horse ain't too happy
with me. I don't blame him.
Nah, he's fine.
Hell.
It sure ain't like
I paid a while ago.
I'm sorry about that.
No, it's fine.
You know there's still
real cowboys down here?
They call each other
partner in a minute.
They roll hard trail
with each other.
You know what, Lonnie?
You gotta get some sleep.
Isn't that where you work?
- Nope.
It sure would be a funny
coincidence, though.
Would you take a turn with me?
I don't reckon I'm worthy to dance
with a lady such as yourself.
Well, I am asking you!
- All right.
- Good, let's dance.
See you in a second.
- I believe this is yours.
- Thanks.
Let's make room for our new
marshall and his lady.
- Duty calls, I'll catch
you later. - Sure thing.
Harlan!
Harlan!
- Don't take another step.
- Take it easy.
You take it easy.
Come on, Twig, come down
untie that horse.
Lonnie, get out of there.
Wade, yout take another step
towards that boy,
and I put the next one
in your head.
Look, nobody is
gonna shoot anybody.
- Let's put the guns down and talk.
- Put your gun down, now!
Easy, with a thumb and
a finger, real slow.
You too, drop that belt.
Go on, drop it!
Come on, Lonnie,
untie the horse.
- He shot Tobe!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
The girl's not dead.
You can tell the police
all the lies you want,
but you and me
both know you killed her.
- You're out of your fucking mind!
- Lonnie knows the truth too!
- Nutcase, you lied to my son!
- Harlan!
Come on, Lonnie!
Let's go.
Damn!
- You okay? - Yes, you take that
and press against that.
Press it right there.
C'mon, press it, press it.
We gotta get off this ridge.
We've gotta get out of here,
help me get on my feet.
And Lightning?
Go!
Stay down.
Will you be all right?
Hope so.
Don't wanna die
in a place like this.
I don't like it in here.
Listen,
stand up and see who's outside.
- It's Lightning.
- What's he doing?
- Nothing, just standing there.
- He'll give us away.
Bring him around back,
put him in the garage.
Wait, look at me.
You can do it, go on!
Go, you can do it!
He was scared, but he's ok now.
Stop!
Don't!
Stay here.
Listen, he shot your sister.
Lonnie, he's the one
who shot Tobe.
- You're lying!
- She'll tell you.
She'll tell you.
What do we say?
Don't say anything.
Just thinking.
