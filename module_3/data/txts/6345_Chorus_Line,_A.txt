Blonde girl in the front, much better,

I'm sorry.
Hi. I know there's an audition

It's really important I get this

Sammy.
Sammy, a messenger is going to
pick this up.
-Could you get this to Zach, please?
-Yes. What is this in reference to?
Just tell him that--
Cassie wants to see him.
Cassie?
Didn't you use to be a dancer?
I saw you. It was in this teatre.
You stopped the show.
I was in highschool.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say it that way,
that's not what I meant.
I'll get this to Zach right away.
Thanks.
My God.
I don't believe it! Come on.
What're you doing here?
Did anybody know you were coming?
No, I just came right from the airport.
Hang on.

Look who's here.
Hi, Cassie.
Sorry to bust in on you like this.
<i>No, it's good to see you.</i>
We're running late.

<i>What's coming next?

<i>What happens now?

Everything's on the back.
Tell me what's not on it.
Like what?
<i>Tell me about the Bronx.</i>
What's to tell about the Bronx?
It's uptown and to the right.
What made you start dancing?
<i>Who knows?</i>
I'm Puerto Rican.
We jump around a lot.
Look, you want to know if I can act?
Give me a scene to read. I'll act.
I'll perform.
<i>But I can't just talk.</i>
Please, I'm too nervous.
You want the job, don't you?
Of course I want the job.
Back in line.
<i>Before we do any more dancing,
we'll do a lot of dancing later,</i>
let me explain what I'm doing.
This is not gonna be
like other auditions.
<i>-I'm looking for a strong chorus...</i>
-I'm sorry, what?
<i>...people who can work together
as a group...</i>
but I'm going to try to shake you up,
see who you really are.
<i>We've got some small
but important parts...</i>
<i>to be played by people in the chorus.
Since I need great dancers,</i>
<i>I can't expect you all
to be great actors.</i>
So I don't want anybody...
to try to act.
Understand?
Just be exactly who you are,
which is just as important to me
as how well you dance.
<i>I'm going to ask you some questions.</i>
<i>What I want to know is
details about yourselves.</i>
Things you're proud of,
things you're ashamed of.
So if anybody can't handle it
and wants to leave,
right now is the time
to make up your mind.
-Honey?
-What?
Could we please go?
We're going to be fine.
Okay...
Stay. We're Puerto Ricans. They say
we're ashamed of everything.
Screw him.
If I could think of anything I was
ashamed of, I'd have tried it years ago.
Zach?
Look, Zach--
I just need a minute.
-How many jobs are there?
-Four and four.
-44?
-No, four and four.
Four boys, four girls.
Need any women?
Cassie.
<i>Dick, I'm going to need a spotlight.
Would you set it up for me, please?</i>
I'm really sorry,
but Zach said he'll call you
as soon as he can.
And he told me to ask you
in a nice way...
if you'd--
would you mind leaving.
Shit.
<i>Taxi!</i>
Cassie!
Taxi!
-Are you all right?
-That was a hell of a fall.
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
<i>Taxi!</i>
-Bloomingdale's.
-Thanks a lot.
<i>Okay, Mike. I'll start with you.</i>
Me?
Aren't you supposed
to start at the end?
<i>So, what would you like to tell me?</i>
I'd like to tell you
to start at the end.
You can wait in the musicians' room.
What am I doing here?
He told me to leave.
I don't care if there's
a tornado out there.
-Shut up. Sorry, are you all right?
-I'm fine.
-You want to put some ice on that elbow?
-I look like a drowned rat.
<i>What made you start dancing?</i>
Because of my sister.
She was a girl.
So my Mom decided she's the one
to get all the dancing lessons.
Every Saturday my mother would take her.
Once in a while she'd take me along.
<i>How old were you?</i>
Four. Five.
I'd sit there all eager and...
<i>I'm watchin' sis go pitter-pat.</i>
<i>Said, "I can do that".</i>
<i>"I can do that".</i>
<i>Knew every step right off the bat.</i>
<i>Said, "I can do that".</i>
<i>"I can do that!"</i>
<i>One morning sis
won't go to dance class.</i>
<i>I grab her shoes and tights and all.</i>
<i>But my foot's too small, so,</i>
<i>I stuff her shoes
with extra socks.</i>
<i>Ran seven blocks,</i>
<i>in nothing flat.</i>
<i>Hell, I can do that.</i>
<i>That I can do!</i>
Give the man some room!
Yeah!
All right!
<i>All thanks to sis,</i>
<i>I can do that.</i>
You have any ice for my ego?
It hurts worse than my elbow.
What did you expect? You know what
Zach's like when he's working.
-If you keep interrupting him--
-Hey!
What're you talking to me
like I'm a grown-up for?
Just stay put.
-And keep that ice on your elbow.
-Larry.
Does Zach still think that I--?
Cassie, let's get one thing straight.
You can stay till you find a place.
But as far as you and Zach are concerned,
I'm not getting in the middle.
Actually, I don't know how
I turned out as heavenly as I did.
<i>Are you going to do a routine?</i>
No, no. Moving right along.
Start with your family.
<i>Do you want to know all the wonderful
things that've happened to me?</i>
<i>Or you want the truth?</i>
I'll take the truth.
My mother had a lot of card parties...
and was one of the foremost
bridge cheaters in America.
My father worked for this
big corporation.
They used to send him
out into the field a lot,
to drink.
But they were okay.
I was the strange one.
<i>How strange?</i>
Real, real strange.
Bizarre.
As I got older,
I got stranger and stranger.
That's when I started
breaking into people's houses.
I didn't steal anything,
I just rearranged their furniture.
<i>I went to this very expensive
private school...</i>
for the exceptionally stupid.
"Jock City".
I was the kid who was always
getting slammed into lockers.
Not only by the students,
by the teachers, too.
I couldn't catch a ball
if it had Elmer's glue on it...
and wouldn't my father have to be
this big ex-football hero.
He was so humiliated that he
didn't know what to tell his friends.
So, he told them all I had polio.
On Father's Day
I used to limp for him.
Oh! And I was always thinking up...
these spectacular ways
how to kill myself.
But I realized, to commit suicide
in Buffalo is redundant.
<i>Okay, Bobby.</i>
Exactly what you don't want, right?
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>Dick?</i>
<i>Give me the spotlight, will you?</i>
<i>Back to the left. A little more.</i>
Hold it. Sheila.
Yes?
Is there anything you want to tell me?
<i>What do I want to be
when I grow up?</i>
Okay.
Young.
That light--
Don't you have anything softer?
<i>Come closer.</i>
Can I sit on your lap?
<i>Do you always come on like this?</i>
No. Sometimes I'm aggressive.
<i>All right, Sheila.
Tell me about your parents.</i>
My parents?
Tell me about your mother.
<i>My mother.</i>
My poor, dear, sweet, grey-haired,
darling old mother.
<i>She was raised in an orphanage,</i>
by nuns.
They wouldn't let her go out--
<i>Goddamnit!
Can't anybody up there hear me?</i>
<i>Just let your hair down!</i>
Can't you talk?
All of you! Just talk!
To me, to each other.
Jesus Christ!
Better?
Your mother...
<i>Right.</i>
My mother was kind of...
middle-aged and frumpy.
Whose isn't?
At 14 she was middle-aged and frumpy.
Is that the kind of woman
your father liked?
No. My father liked them
very young, tall...
and filled out
in all the right places.
Anyway, uh...
God knows why,
they had this daughter.
Me.
And just to get away from her
frumpy middle-aged life...
she used to take me to every
ballet that came to town.
I think probably because
it was cheaper than a baby-sitter.
That's when I saw that movie...
"The Red Shoes".
<i>You too? It changed my whole life.</i>
<i>I saw that movie 112 times.</i>
I swear, on the grave of my mother!
<i>Go on, Sheila.</i>
Well, let's face it.
My family scene was, uh,
not good.
<i>Daddy thought
he married beneath him.</i>
<i>That's what he said,
that's what he said.</i>
<i>When he proposed
he informed my mother,</i>
<i>he was probably
her very last chance.</i>
<i>And though she was 22,</i>
<i>though she was 22,
though she was 22,</i>
<i>she married him.</i>
<i>Life with my dad
wasn't ever a picnic,</i>
<i>more like a "come-as-you-are".</i>
<i>When I was five
I remember my mother</i>
<i>dug earrings out of the car.</i>
<i>I knew that they weren't hers,</i>
<i>but it wasn't something
you'd want to discuss.</i>
<i>He wasn't warm.</i>
<i>Well, not to her.</i>
<i>Well, not to us.</i>
<i>But everything was beautiful</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>Graceful men lift
lovely girls</i>
<i>in white.</i>
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful</i>
<i>at the ballet, hey.</i>
<i>I was happy</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>That's when I started ballet class.</i>
<i>Up a steep
and very narrow stairway</i>
<i>to a voice like a metronome.</i>
<i>Up a steep
and very narrow stairway</i>
<i>it wasn't paradise,</i>
<i>it wasn't paradise,</i>
<i>it wasn't paradise,
but it was home.</i>
<i>Mother always said
I'd be very attractive,</i>
<i>when I grew up, when I grew up.</i>
<i>"Different", she said,
"with a special something,"</i>
<i>"and a very, very personal flair".</i>
<i>And though I was eight or nine,</i>
<i>and though I was eight or nine,</i>
<i>and though I was eight or nine,</i>
<i>I hated her.</i>
<i>Now, "different" is nice,
but it sure isn't pretty.</i>
<i>Pretty is what it's about.</i>
<i>I never met anyone
who was "different"</i>
<i>who couldn't figure that out.</i>
<i>So beautiful</i>
<i>I'd never live to see.</i>
<i>But it was clear,</i>
<i>if not to her,</i>
<i>well, then to me,</i>
<i>that everyone is beautiful</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>Every prince has got to have</i>
<i>his swan.</i>
<i>Yes, everyone is beautiful</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>I was pretty</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>I was born to save their marriage.</i>
<i>But when my father came to pick
me and my mother up at the hospital,</i>
<i>he said,
"I thought this was going to help,"</i>
<i>"but I guess not."</i>
<i>A few months later he left
and never came back.</i>
<i>Anyway, I had
this incredible fantasy life.</i>
<i>I used to dance around
the living-room, with my arms up,</i>
<i>like this.</i>
<i>And in my fantasy there was
this Indian chief,</i>
<i>and he'd say to me,</i>
<i>"Maggie, do you want to dance?"</i>
<i>And I'd say,</i>
<i>"Daddy, I would love to dance."</i>
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>Raise your arms</i>
<i>and someone's always there.</i>
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>The ballet.</i>
<i>The ballet.</i>
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
<i>I was pretty,</i>
<i>I was happy,</i>
<i>I would love to,</i>
<i>at the ballet.</i>
Where the hell is the resumé
of the blonde in the two-piece?
This one? Bebe Benson.
Can we smoke?
Can the adults please smoke?
No breaks, Sheila.
Then, can I discuss that
with my kidneys?
-Fine.
-Thank you.
Kristine.
<i>Me?</i>
I don't know where to begin.
Tell him
how you got started dancing.
Well, it was when this man
came around my home...
-selling--
-Lessons.
Yeah! Lessons.
Dancing lessons.
And-- well, ever since then,
I watched everything on TV
that had any dancing on it.
Specially--
<i>Oh, God, um--</i>
<i>What do you call 'em? Uh,</i>
-Variety shows.
-Right! Variety shows.
Specials.
I can't remember
what I was talking about.
Variety shows.
No, I wasn't-- it was--
Specials. The specials.
Right.
Um, specials.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
It's just I'm really nervous.
You want to take a minute
to pull yourself together?
<i>Uh, Zach...</i>
For her, this is together.
<i>Robbie...</i>
they're in a suitcase
over there, somewhere. Cass--
Sheila, get your ass
up on the stage.
Why is it only my ass that
ever gets invited places?
<i>Please, Al. Your turn.</i>
Costumes are in there.
Hats should be in this one.
Listen, go up to the prop room,
we've been using it for an office.
I think you'd better
stay out of sight for a while.
I know I'm putting you in a spot,
but I need a job.
-I really do need--
-Hey, hey.
I'll talk to Zach, but you've got to
stay put, for Christ sake.
No more interruptions, okay?
Promise?
Say, "I promise."
-I promise.
-Okay.
But I'm straight.
I'm not too bright,
but I'm not too dumb.
And...
I'm not too talented.
But you know me, Zach.
You show me what to do,
<i>and I'm gonna do it
the exact same way,</i>
<i>eight shows a week, forever.</i>
Can I go next?
I don't really have
anything to say, it's just that...
this waiting is killing me!
Okay.
Why don't we, uh,
start with your childhood?
It was terrible,
just like everybody else's.
<i>All of it?</i>
None of it, really.
But who wants to admit
to a happy childhood?
How about sex?
<i>Sex?</i>
Oh, sex!
Now, that was really terrible!
<i>How?</i>
I was twelve years old
and I didn't know much about it.
So I went to the library
I took out this medical book...
with pictures
of the male and female anatomy in it.
I thought it was pretty interesting.
I used to read that book a lot!
<i>Were you interested in medicine?
Or were you just into the pictures?</i>
I knew what I wanted to know...
<i>Hello, twelve.</i>
<i>Hello, thirteen.</i>
<i>Hello, love.</i>
Anyway, after I had my first--
wet dream, I went straight to
the medical book and looked it up.
"Milky discharge... "
Oh, my God! Gonorrhea!
<i>Changes, oh.</i>
<i>Down below.</i>
<i>Up above.</i>
I couldn't ask my Dad about it.
I was in shock!
I mean, God!
I didn't have anybody to talk to.
So, well, I went to the priest.
When I told him I had gonorrhea,
was he in shock!
<i>"Who have you been with, my son?"</i>
<i>"Nobody, uh... Nobody."</i>
<i>"Then how can you have gonorrhea?"</i>
Well, finally,
I told him about the book, and...
he set me straight.
Which is the only time
the church ever helped me out.
<i>Time to doubt,</i>
<i>to break out.</i>
<i>It's a mess.</i>
<i>It's a mess!</i>
Sex happens to be one subject
I can speak about...
with absolutely
no authority whatsoever.
<i>Too young to take over.</i>
It took me five years...
<i>Too old to ignore.</i>
Finally I got a girl
who was actually willing to do it.
There I am, making out in the
backseat with Sally Ketchum.
A little of this, a little of that.
Very little of that.
After about an hour she said,
"Don't you want to do anything else?"
I suddenly thought to myself...
"No, I don't."
<i>Did this come
as a big surprise to you?</i>
I guess.
Yeah.
It was the moment
I realized I was gay.
<i>Hello, twelve.</i>
<i>Hello, thirteen.</i>
<i>Hello, love.</i>
Talk about love. My first time
was with this girl, Paulette.
Forget about it.
We did it in a graveyard.
<i>First time we made love</i>
<i>it was a great deal.</i>
<i>I was too scared to feel,</i>
<i>nervous from trying.</i>
<i>Next time we made love</i>
<i>still we were not a hit.</i>
<i>I thought, if this is it,</i>
<i>everyone's lying.</i>
<i>But then we did it again,</i>
<i>and I forgot to be scared,
I guess.</i>
<i>'Cause when we did it again</i>
<i>I closed my eyes...</i>
<i>Surprise!</i>
<i>Sweet, icicle hot,</i>
<i>smooth as a lemon pie.</i>
<i>Sailing across the sky,</i>
<i>into the ocean.</i>
<i>We liked it a lot,</i>
<i>you can imagine why.</i>
<i>We had begun to fly,</i>
<i>feelings in motion.</i>
<i>And then we did it again.</i>
<i>I'm thinking,
"was it beginner's luck?"</i>
<i>Or is it wonderful once</i>
<i>in each three tries?</i>
<i>Surprise!</i>
<i>Surprise.</i>
<i>First time.</i>
<i>Love.</i>
<i>Again.</i>
<i>So I closed my eyes.</i>
<i>It was a sweet surprise.</i>
<i>Icicle hot,</i>
<i>smooth as a lemon pie.
<i>Surprise, surprise,
surprise, surprise.</i>
I mean it! How would you like
to stay 12 years old all your life?
My last show, I played a 14-year-old.
and I just turned 23.
The Year of the Chicken?
Cought.
Hey, didn't you go to the
High School of Performing Arts?
I thought you looked familiar!
Do you remember Mr. Karp,
the acting teacher?
Oh, yeah.
"In order to be a real actor,
it is not enough to act like a king."
"You also got to act like a throne."
Tell me about it, Morales.
On the first day of acting class,
Mr. Karp puts us on the stage,
with our legs around each other,
one in back of the other, and he says,
"We're going to do improvisations."
"You're on a bobsled."
"It's snowing out."
"And it's cold."
"Okay. Go."
<i>Every day for a week
we'd try to feel the motion,</i>
<i>feel the motion,
down the hill.</i>
<i>Every day for a week
we'd try to hear the wind rush,</i>
<i>hear the wind rush
feel the chill.</i>
<i>So I dug right down
to the bottom of my soul,</i>
<i>to see what I had inside.</i>
<i>Yes, I dug right down
to the bottom of my soul,</i>
<i>and I tried.</i>
<i>I tried.</i>
And everybody's going,
"Whoosh,  whoosh!"
"I feel the snow!"
"I feel the cold!"
"I feel the air!"
Mr. Karp comes up to me
and he says,
"Okay, Morales, what did you feel?"
And I said,
<i>"Nothing, I'm feeling nothing."</i>
<i>And he said, "Nothing
could get a girl transferred."</i>
<i>They all felt something,
but I felt nothing,</i>
<i>except the feeling that
this bullshit was absurd.</i>
So I said to myself,
"Don't worry about it."
"It's only the first week.
Maybe it's genetic."
"They don't have bobsleds
in San Juan."
<i>Second week, more advanced,
and we had to be a table,</i>
<i>be a sports car,
ice-cream cone.</i>
Mr. Karp, he would say,
"Very good, except Morales."
"Try, Morales, all alone."
<i>So I dug right down
to the bottom of my soul</i>
<i>to see how an ice-cream felt.</i>
<i>Yes, I dug right down
to the bottom of my soul</i>
<i>and I tried</i>
<i>to melt.</i>
<i>And the kids yelled "Nothing!".</i>
<i>They called me "Nothing",</i>
<i>and Karp allowed it,
which really made me burn.</i>
<i>They were so helpful!</i>
<i>They called me "hopeless",</i>
<i>until I really didn't know
where else to turn.</i>
Mr. Karp comes up to me and says,
"You know what, Morales?
I think you should try the Girls' High."
"You'll never be an actress. Never."
Jesus Christ.
<i>Went to church, praying
"Santa Maria, send me guidance",</i>
<i>"send me guidance", on my knees.</i>
<i>Went to church, praying
"Santa Maria, help me feel it",</i>
<i>"help me feel it, pretty please".</i>
<i>And a voice from down at
the bottom of my soul</i>
<i>came up to the top of my head.</i>
<i>A voice from down at
the bottom of my soul,</i>
<i>here is what it said,</i>
<i>"This man is nothing,
this course is nothing."</i>
<i>"If you want something,
go find a better class".</i>
<i>"And when you find one
you'll be an actress".</i>
<i>And I assure you
that's what finally came to pass.</i>
<i>Six months later I heard
that Karp</i>
<i>had died.</i>
<i>So I dug way down
to the bottom of my soul,</i>
<i>and cried,</i>
<i>'cause I felt...</i>
<i>nothing.</i>
Okay, Don.
To be honest, I've been listening
to these people all day long...
trying to be honest. I mean,
say I pull a hamstring, you know?
Let's be honest. Here today,
gone tomorrow. You know what I mean?
Like the couple over here,
that just got married. I mean--
Every time I tell my wife
I'm going to audition,
well, she's got a right to--
you know?
I mean-- What the hell!
It's not a question of--
You know what I mean?
I'm a damned good waiter.
I got two kids, and a wife,
a mother on social security
I'm trying to keep from eating cat food.
So my daytime job--
It's not a question of--
Look, I'm a waiter,
that's what I am.
On applications it says "occupation",
I put "dancer".
You know how many waiter jobs
I'm fired of?
One time late, sure,
but auditions, never, you know?
One of my kids, sometimes...
like my wife says...
But, come on! On applications?
Tuesday, Wednesday. Summer, winter.
I mean, Jesus!
Look, I'm married to this sweetest
little wife in the world, but, uh...
I don't know...
Listen, before madam here
makes a big deal out of it,
Cassie is in the prop room till
the rain stops. I told her to.
What is she doing this for?
I don't think
she's been working too much.
What do you mean? She's broke?
Is that it? She needs money?
-I have no idea.
-I don't know.
Talk to her.
Val?
Goddamnit, Larry!
Is the loading door closed?
I'll get it.
Go ahead, Val. I'm sorry.
<i>First of all,
let's get one thing straight.</i>
I never heard of "The Red Shoes",
I never saw "The Red Shoes"...
I don't give a shit about
"The Red Shoes".
I came to New York because I wanted
to be a Rockette at Radio City.
There was this girl in my home town,
Betty Lou Heiner.
She had actually gotten out,
she made it in New York.
She was a Rockette.
One Christmas, she came home for a visit,
and they gave her a parade.
A goddamn parade!
I had to twirl a friggin' baton
in the pouring rain for two hours.
Unfortunately, though,
she got knocked up over Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
Anyway, that was my plan,
to be a  Rockette.
But the problem was, I was so ugly
you wouldn't believe it.
I mean, I was homely. Skinny.
Flat as a pancake.
But anyway, there I was.
I got off the bus,
wearing my little white tights,
little white shoes, little white dress.
I looked like a fucking nurse.
Six months later, I finally got
my audition at Radio City.
You know what the man said to me?
He said he didn't like my fan kicks.
I can do terrific fan kicks!
So I said, "Screw you,
Radio City and the Rockettes!"
"I'm going to make it on Broadway."
But in every audition,
I would dance rings
around the other girls,
but I wound up in the alley
with the other rejects.
Until one day,
after an audition,
I swiped my dance card.
On a scale of 1 to 10
they gave me for dance...
10.
For looks...
3.
<i>Dance: 10, looks: 3?</i>
<i>And I'm still on unemployment.</i>
<i>Dancing for my own enjoyment,</i>
<i>that ain't it, kid,
that ain't it, kid.</i>
<i>Dance: 10, looks: 3?</i>
<i>is like to die.</i>
<i>Left the theater,
called the doctor for</i>
<i>my appointment to buy...</i>
<i>tits and ass,</i>
<i>bought myself a fancy pair.</i>
<i>Tightened up the derriere,</i>
<i>did the nose with it,
all that goes with it.</i>
<i>Tits and ass,</i>
<i>had the bingo-bongos done.</i>
<i>Suddenly I'm getting
national tours.</i>
<i>Tits and ass,</i>
<i>won't get you jobs</i>
<i>unless they're yours.</i>
<i>Didn't cost a fortune, neither.</i>
<i>Didn't hurt my sex life, either.</i>
<i>Flat and sassy,</i>
<i>I would get the strays and losers.</i>
<i>Beggars really can't be choosers.</i>
<i>That ain't it, kid,
<i>that ain't it, kid.</i>
<i>Fixed the chassis.</i>
<i>"How do you do?"</i>
<i>Life turned into
an endless medley of:</i>
<i>"Gee, it had to be you"</i>
<i>Why?
Tits and ass.</i>
<i>Where the cupboard once was bare</i>
<i>now you knock and someone's there.</i>
<i>You have got 'em, hey,
top to bottom, hey!</i>
<i>It's a gas!</i>
<i>Just a dash of silicone.</i>
<i>Shake your new maracas</i>
<i>and you're fine!</i>
<i>Tits and ass,</i>
<i>can change your life.</i>
<i>They sure changed mine.</i>
You're all looking at my tits now,
aren't you?
I'd settle for just one of yours.
Well, go out and buy them.
<i>Have it all done.</i>
<i>Honey, take my word.</i>
<i>Grab a cab, c'mon,
see the wizard on</i>
<i>Park and 73rd.
For...</i>
<i>tits and ass.</i>
<i>Orchestra and balcony.</i>
<i>What they want is what you see.</i>
<i>Keep the best of you,
do the rest of you.</i>
<i>Pits or class,</i>
<i>I have never seen it fail.</i>
<i>Debutante or chorus girl
or wife.</i>
<i>Tits and ass,</i>
<i>yes, tits and ass,</i>
<i>have changed my life.</i>
<i>Thank you, Val.</i>
Paul.
Sir?
<i>When did you start dancing?</i>
Not until pretty late.
<i>Why?</i>
I don't know why.
I just didn't.
<i>What did you do?</i>
Nothing much.
What was your family like?
We were close.
<i>Any brothers and sisters?</i>
Two sisters.
One died when I was 14.
<i>How?</i>
I really don't want
to talk about that.
I mean,
why do we have to talk about that?
Okay, Paul. Thank you.
Back in line.
Can he keep us standing here
this long?
Zach?
We've been standing here
for quite a while.
So, maybe we can take a five?
Take five, everybody.
<i>Five means five, guys, not fifteen.</i>
Stanley, can I hear the "One" routine
starting after the insert?
Uncle Larry's heartbreak kit.
One totally indigestible
cold pastrami.
One lukewarm celery tonic.
I'm going back on the 6:30 plane.
That sure's silly. You just
got here and I just talked to Zach.
C'mon, Larry, what's the point?
He doesn't think I came for a job. He--
Tell me the truth.
When I left, how did he take it?
You know how I knew how bad
he wanted me back?
'Cause he didn't call me once.
Not once to beg me:
"Please, come back."
As if I would, of course.
It's not that he can't be sweet
funny and even warm, but I--
Look, Larry, do me a favor, will ya?
He is what he is, and that's that.
Just stop talking about him, okay?
Cassie, Zach asked me
to give you this.
It's the telephone number of his
business manager, in case you'd--
-Well, he thought you might need--
-Some money?
-Cassie, he didn't mean--
-Money. "If I need some money"!
-All he meant was--
-Please.
If you change your mind
about going back...
My sister was such a little brat,
that was the reason.
But still, I guess it was
a little extreme shaving her head.
Would you like to hear about
the first time I saw a dead body?
I guess I was six or seven...
Larry!
Where the hell is Larry?
Larry, do me a favor.
Everybody, go downstairs and
learn the lyrics to the "One" routine.
Okay, let's go.
Kill the rail and
hit the work lights, please.
<i>Cassie...</i>
I'm trying to work.
Me, too!
That's what I'm trying to do.
I don't need a handout.
I need a job.
Goddamnit! It's my turn to audition,
like everybody else!
No. No, you shouldn't have come.
And if you'd called me,
I would've saved you the trouble.
This is for chorus,
it's not for you.
But this is the only place
there is for me!
<i>Zach, I'm a gypsy.</i>
I never had an apartment in my life
that wasn't a sublet.
All I know how to do
is to point my toes and leap.
<i>I, oh, Zach...</i>
<i>I'm a dancer.</i>
<i>That's who I am.</i>
<i>What I do.</i>
<i>I,</i>
<i>I am a dancer.</i>
<i>Give me the steps,</i>
<i>I'll come through.</i>
<i>Give me somebody to dance for.</i>
<i>Give me somebody to show.</i>
<i>Let me wake up
in the morning to find</i>
<i>I have somewhere exciting to go.</i>
<i>Christ, Cassie,
how can I put you in a line?</i>
You don't fit.
You're too goddamned good!
You bet I am! And I'm so good
I can dance any way you want me to.
<i>Let me dance for you,</i>
<i>let me try.</i>
<i>Let me dance for you.</i>
<i>We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I.</i>
-"We"? Are you talking about us?
-No, Zach.
I'm talking about a job.
I haven't worked in over a year.
<i>Please,</i>
<i>give me an answer.</i>
<i>Give me a place</i>
<i>to begin.</i>
<i>I,</i>
<i>I am a dancer.</i>
<i>I have come home!</i>
<i>Let me in.</i>
<i>Give me somebody to dance with.</i>
<i>Give me somebody to be.</i>
<i>Let me wake up
feeling terribly proud</i>
<i>that the girl in the mirror</i>
<i>is me.</i>
<i>Let me dance for you,</i>
<i>let me try.</i>
<i>Let me dance for you.</i>
<i>We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I.</i>
<i>Let me dance for you,</i>
<i>let me try.</i>
<i>Let me dance for you.</i>
<i>We made a lot of music dancing,
you and--</i>
Cassie!
All right.
Go down with the others
and learn the lyrics.
<i>We'll see.</i>
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, Paul?
I just wanted to ask,
If I can't talk
about myself, I'm out?
I think you're
a hell of a dancer, Paul.
I can't do it.
I wish I could,
but I just can't.
Let me ask you something.
I'm curious.
If you were gonna change your name,
why did you go from
Puerto Rican to Italian?
People always used to say
I don't look Puerto Rican.
<i>So you figured you look Italian?</i>
No.
I just wanted to be somebody new.
So I became Paul San Marco.
Why would you want to be
somebody new?
I don't know.
I'm not too proud of myself,
I guess.
Why did you decide
to become a dancer?
<i>My father loves movies.</i>
<i>When I was a kid, he used to
take us all the time to 42nd St.</i>
The ones I loved were the musicals.
<i>How old were you?</i>
Ten or eleven.
42nd Street,
with all those crazies?
<i>He didn't know that.
It was cheap and--</i>
Anyway,
because of my eyes--
I wear contacts now,
I'd have to move down front
by myself, so I could see.
And all these strange men
would come and sit beside me,
and play with me, you know?
-Look, Paul, if this is too rough, uh--
-No. I mean, I knew I was gay.
In school, they'd whistle at me
in the halls and everything.
But what really bothered me was
I didn't know how to be a man.
What was your first job as a dancer?
At the Jewel Box Revue.
A drag show. I was fifteen.
I went to audition, but
they weren't interested in my dancing.
They said, "Show us your legs",
they took me to a filthy rat hole.
They shaved my legs,
and put a pair of nylon stockings
on me, and high heels.
There I was, in show business.
The asshole
of show business, but a job.
-What did you tell your parents?
-That I was a dancer in a show.
Not what kind, of course.
They couldn't stop bragging.
<i>Go on, Paul.</i>
The show was going to Chicago.
My parents wanted to bring my suitcase,
down to the theatre, after the show,
to say goodbye and--
I don't know why, I said okay.
We were doing this Oriental number,
I was wearing an Oriental dress
and this enormous headdress,
with gold balls hanging all over it.
I was going down the steps,
for the finale, when I saw my parents.
They got there too early.
I freaked out, didn't know what to do.
I ran past them, as quick as I could,
hoping they wouldn't recognize me.
But the minute I passed,
I heard my mother say...
"Oh, my God."
I died!
After the show, I took off
my make-up, put on my clothes,
not knowing if they'd be
downstairs or what.
But there they were, standing
in the middle of all these freaks.
You should've seen my parents.
They didn't know where to look.
My mother had the guts
to look me in the eyes.
I could tell she'd been crying.
"Make sure you eat good," she said.
Bu then my father
couldn't even look at me.
"Take care of yourself," he said.
And they started out.
But then my father turned around
and went over to the producer.
"Take care of my son," he said.
That was the first time
he ever called me that.
Come on.
Zach?
Are you okay?
Go grab a hat.
Let's go, Larry. Bring them in.
Okay, everybody!
We're back up on stage! Let's go!
<i>every move that she makes</i>
We can, we can.
<i>One smile and suddenly nobody</i>
Take one that fits.
Don't keep him waiting.
All right.
<i>Let's go with the combination that
goes with the lyrics you just learned.</i>
<i>Everybody on the stage
and spread out.</i>
-Hit the rail lights, please.
-Is this where he picks the eight?
This is important.
I want to see unison dancing.
Every head, arm, body angle,
exactly the same.
I don't want anybody
to pull my focus.
Okay, Larry.
Okay, let's review it.
Starting position is upstage.
Just to remind you.
Chin up, hat down.
Pop the right heel.
Reverse directions.
Five, six, seven, eight!
<i>One
<i>singular sensation
<i>every little step she takes.
Okay, hold it. Hold it.
You with us? Okay.
On "singular sensation",
make sure your arm goes
all the way across your face
and back to shoulder.
Three, four!
<i>singular sensation</i>
<i>every little step she takes.</i>
<i>One</i>
<i>thrilling combination</i>
<i>every move that she makes.</i>
Six, seven, eight.
<i>One smile and suddenly, nobody</i>
<i>else will do.</i>
<i>You know you'll
never be lonely with</i>
<i>you know who.</i>
<i>One</i>
Okay, hold it!. Let's go on,
away from the mirrors.
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.
After the grapevine,
when do we pop the chin?
-You pop the chin on two.
-And when does the hat go up?
Hat goes up on five.
One, two, three, four, five.
<i>Okay, listen up!</i>
Larry's got the style I'm looking for.
Very thirties. Keep your eye on Larry.
<i>Let's continue now from
"moment in her presence".</i>
And,
five, six, seven, eight!
<i>One</i>
<i>moment in her presence</i>
<i>and you can forget the rest,</i>
<i>for the girl is second best</i>
<i>to none,</i>
<i>son.</i>
<i>Ooh! Sigh!</i>
<i>Give her your attention.</i>
<i>Do... I...</i>
<i>really have to mention</i>
<i>she's the</i>
<i>One?</i>
Okay, let me see you
in groups of four.
This time I want to hear
the lyrics in each group.
And,
five, six, seven, eight.
<i>One</i>
<i>singular sensation</i>
<i>One, turn, up, down.</i>
<i>every little step she takes.</i>
<i>One, turn, up, down.</i>
<i>Spotlight, out, in,

Okay, girls, just the girls,

Here we go!
Five, six, seven, eight.

Boys! From the top.
Five, six, seven, eight.

Do it again with the boys.
You're still doing it too much.

Goddamnit, Cassie, you're disturbing
the combination! Now, pull in!
<i>One?</i>
Okay, everybody, from the top!
Let's go!
Five, six, seven, eight.
<i>One</i>
<i>singular sensation</i>
<i>every little step she takes.</i>
<i>One</i>
<i>thrilling combination</i>
<i>every move that she makes.</i>
<i>One smile and suddenly, nobody</i>
<i>else will do.</i>
<i>You know you'll
never be lonely with</i>
<i>you know who.</i>
<i>One</i>
<i>moment in her presence</i>
<i>and you can forget the rest,</i>
<i>for the girl is second best</i>
<i>to none,</i>
<i>son.</i>
¡Cassie!
<i>Give her your attention.</i>
Come down here!
<i>really have to mention</i>
<i>she's the</i>
<i>One?
One smile and suddenly, nobody</i>
<i>else will do.</i>
<i>You know you'll
never be lonely with</i>
<i>you know who.</i>
-Turn around and look at the routine.
Is that what you really want?
<i>One</i>
<i>moment in her presence</i>
<i>and you can forget the rest,</i>
<i>for the girl is second best</i>
<i>to none,</i>
<i>son!</i>
<i>Ooh! Sigh!</i>
<i>Give her your attention.</i>
<i>Do... I...</i>
<i>really have to mention</i>
<i>she's the</i>
<i>One!</i>
<i>One!</i>
<i>One!</i>
<i>One!</i>
That's who I am.
No, you're not! You're special!
Zach, we're all special. Paul, Bebe,
Sheila and everybody up there.
Damn it!
You know what I'm talking about!
Look at them.
Look at them.
Why did you leave me?
Why, Zach, you noticed.
At least you could've told me
about that job in Hollywood--
And what would you've told me
if I told you? "Take it", right?
-I didn't want you to tell me "Take it".
-What're you talking about? You took it!
That's one thing, my taking it.
Your telling me "take it"
is something else.
Anyway, you're the one who left,
months before I went to Hollywood.
I left? We were living together!
Sharing the same apartment, maybe.
But when did I ever see you?
Now what're you giving me?
The neglected woman bullshit?
You were jealous of my work?
-You acted so proud of what I was doing.
-Zach, I was proud! I still am.
And I know that directing a show
takes 24 hours a day...
which I wanted for you
as much as you--
As long as I spend an equal 24 hours
with you, right?
-Exactly! That's all I wanted.
-And you're going to tell me
exactly how I could've done that?
If I knew that, then I'd be the hit
and you'd be asking me for a job.
<i>Cassie.</i>
Jesus.
Don't you know why
I took that job in Hollywood?
Not for me. For you.
It was the only way that
I could hold you, I thought,
was to be a star like you.
Make you want me again.
Treat me important.
<i>Ready, Zach?</i>
<i>Who do you want to pick?</i>
I don't know yet.
Let's do the tap combination
and start matching them up.
<i>Okay, everybody,
for the tap combination...</i>
<i>we're gonna start
after the second eight count.</i>
<i>Girls downstage, boys upstage.</i>
Nice and easy. And,
five, six, seven, eight.
<i>Kiss today goodbye,</i>
<i>The sweetness and the sorrow.</i>
<i>Wish me luck,</i>
<i>the same to you,</i>
<i>but I can't regret</i>
<i>what I did for love.</i>
<i>What I did for love.</i>
<i>Look, my eyes are dry.</i>
<i>The gift was ours to borrow.</i>
<i>It's as if we always</i>
<i>knew.</i>
<i>And I won't regret</i>
<i>what I did for love.</i>
<i>What I did for love.</i>
<i>Gone,</i>
<i>love is never gone.</i>
<i>As we travel on</i>
<i>love's what we'll remember.</i>
<i>Kiss today goodbye</i>
<i>and point me toward tomorrow.</i>
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>
<i>Won't forget, can't regret</i>
<i>what I did for love.</i>
<i>What I did for love.</i>
<i>What I did for</i>
<i>love.</i>
Okay, we're gonna put you
into groups of four.
Two and two. Let me see.
Mike, Maggie. Paul, Connie.
Girls downstage, boys upstage.
Let's go!
Ready?
Five, six, seven, ¡and eight!.
Connie, smile bigger,
if you gotta fake it.
Tapping's not my strongest point.
What?
Tapping's not my strongest point!
I see that.
I'll be right back.
-Paul! You all right?
-Don't move him! Don't move him.
Larry, call Dr. Rhodes.
838-1393.
It's his knee, the cartilage.
He had it operated on last year.
Don't move him, don't move him.
Maybe we should put something
under his knee.
-Get him the ice bag.
-It's okay, really. I just twisted it.
-Does anyone have any Darvon? Valium?
-I do.
-Somebody get some water.
-I'll get it.
It's already swelling.
You're gonna be okay, Paul.
You're gonna be just fine.
You think we should give him that?
-We don't know what's wrong.
-I've had three already, since lunch.
<i>-It's just a muscle relaxer.</i>
-Zach, Rhodes is at St. Joseph's.
He said to bring him to Emergency.
He'll be waiting.
-where's his handbag?
-I'll get it!
-You got the knee?
-Yeah, I got it.
Paul, you'll be all right. Rhodes is
the best knee doctor in the city.
-Paul, I got your bag!
-Good luck, Paul.
Call me from the hospital!
Do you ever think about what
you're gonna do if you stop dancing?
Me?
Yeah.
Real life, I guess.
What? Getting married, having babies?
Go off my diet.
What about you, Mark?
<i>Do you want to spend your life
dancing in a chorus?</i>
I'd just like to get in one.
You don't remember, but
we were in a show together,
in the chorus,
about a hundred years ago.
Of course I remember.
You were a rotten dancer.
Why do you think I became
a choreographer?
How've you been, Sheila?
God, since then, I don't know.
Good, terrific...
okay, so-so.
You know I actually found
the glass slipper once,
and it fit.
But then it broke.
I have a daughter. She's nine.
She loves me a lot, hates me a lot.
And, uh...
God help her,
she wants to be a dancer.
<i>What's so wrong about that?</i>
How can anybody in their right mind
want to be anything else?
I remember I used to stand
outside this stage door,
and watch the girls come out,
and think:
"God, can anything like that
ever happen to me?"
But now I meet somebody,
and they say:
"Wow, you dance on Broadway?
"You got somewhere. You're something."
Hell of a day, huh?
Yeah...
A few months ago,
the night before I was going to
audition for a new show,
I had a-- kind of breakdown.
I started crying and I couldn't stop
for about two weeks.
I just got out of the hospital and...
my doctor told me it was
too soon to try again.
But I did.
And now, even if I lose,
I won.
Hell of a day.
Larry.
-Line 'em up, Zach?
-Yeah, line 'em up.
Okay. Everybody on the line.
Before we start eliminating...
You're all terrific,
and special.
Very special. I wish I could
hire you all but I can't.
So, the following people
please step forward.
<i>Judy.</i>
<i>Don.</i>
<i>Greg.</i>
<i>Sheila.</i>
<i>Al.</i>
<i>Diana.</i>
<i>No. Excuse me.</i>
Diana,
will you get back in line, please?
<i>Kristine.</i>
<i>Connie.</i>
<i>Maggie.</i>
Front line, thank you very much.
I'm sorry.
Rehearsals begin September 22nd.
We're going to rehearse for six weeks,
with a two-week out of town tryout.
It could be Boston or Philadelphia.
<i>The New York opening will be
some time mid-January.</i>
<i>Prepare to sign
the standard minimum contract,</i>
<i>with a six-month rider.</i>
<i>Check with Larry to set an appointment
for your costume measurings.</i>
<i>Bring your dance shoes
and sneakers to all rehearsals.</i>
<i>Please, do not, I repeat,
do not change your hairstyle or color.</i>
<i>I'm really happy
that we'll be working together.</i>
<i>I gotta tell you,
I'm really excited.</i>
Thank you, very much.
Thank you.
Dick?
That's it. Thanks a lot.
<i>Cassie.</i>
How you dress!
You know, you can get arrested
for wearing those colors?
