Tickets, please.
Tickets.
Tickets?
Thank you. Tickets?
Is it far to Tucumcari?
- We pass it in a few minutes.
- Thanks.
Excuse me.
You're mistaken, Reverend.
I heard you're going to Tucumcari.
You're on the wrong train.
The nearest stop is Amarillo.
Get off at Santa Fe,
return by way of Amarillo.
You'll get where you're going.
You see,
the train doesn't stop at Tucumcari.
This train will stop there.
Easy, everybody.
- Why'd you stop? Something wrong?
- Somebody pulled the emergency cord.
You can't pull the cord
and jump off.
Why'd you do that?
If you want to get off...
We'd be pleased
to make any arrangements
if you want to get off here, sir.
I did get off. Thanks.
All right, let's go!
Go ahead. Let's go!
He came by in person
and added those two zeros.
He was spitting mad.
He wasn't flattered.
He said,
"A measly $1,000 is too little.
I'm worth a lot more."
That's right, he said that.
Then he added the zeros.
No one has the guts
to face that killer.
At least...
It's been that way till now.
Where is he?
Where is he?
I've no idea.
Oh, look.
Pardon me, ma'am.
I'll kill you for this.
There you are, $1,000.
Tell me about Cavanaugh.
He was seen at White Rocks.
Thanks.
If it's of any interest,
somebody else asked me about him.
- Who?
- I've never seen him before.
His name is... Manco.
Light?
You know B.B. Cavanaugh?
Tell me.
You know where I can find him?
There. At that table.
He's got his back to you.
Thanks.
Two cards.
Didn't hear what the bet was.
Your life.
Alive or dead, it's your choice.
Let Bret go!
$2,000. That's a lot of money.
Takes me three years to earn it.
Isn't a sheriff supposed
to be courageous, loyal
and above all honest?
Yeah. That he is.
Think you people need a new sheriff.
Hughey.
Hasta luego,
amigo.
- How are you, Nick?
- Better when I see you.
Go on, go ahead.
Open it.
- What's up? Who is it?
- Rodriguez, se単or.
You.
Come along.
I'm letting you live.
So you can tell everybody
what takes place here.
For the lousy money.
You took money to put me in jail.
You should have killed me.
Would be better for you.
And for them.
How old is the boy?
How old, I asked!
18 months.
Just the time that I was in jail.
You used the reward you got
to start raising a family.
So I feel
your family is partly mine.
I'll take my part now.
Outside.
They're both innocent.
Please let them go. I was the one.
No!
I know.
I'm sure you hate me just enough.
Now you can shoot me,
but not in the back.
Let go!
When the music finishes, begin.
Or do you think you can't?
Let's start.
Now.
- Check those figures again.
- Yes, sir.
Good day, sir.
Good afternoon.
Mortimer.
- Douglas Mortimer.
- Virginia, isn't it?
- Carolina.
- Yes, Carolina.
Can I help in some way?
- I'm looking for a first class bank.
- But exactly!
Yeah.
The territory's largest
and most secure bank.
I want to assure you we have
all the safeguards you desire.
Surely, but I have
a large sum to deposit.
Suppose I'm a bandit.
- A bandit?
- Yeah, with a gang of killers.
- Which is the hardest bank to rob?
- I'd suggest one bank in your case.
The Bank of El Paso.
Even Indio wouldn't dare.
It's not a bank,
it's a fortress there.
- When's the next train to El Paso?
- 11:30.
I'll telegraph my colleague there
that you're coming.
Thanks.
Mister, captain, gent, welcome.
Do you need a stable,
or a room, a bath?
My name is Fernando.
The stable's here, that's your hotel.
- Why this hotel?
- You wouldn't like the other one.
You'd shoot roaches half the night.
Here the rooms cost less
and there's a landlady.
- Married?
- Yes. She doesn't care.
The bank.
When I get money I'll put it in.
You'll have to earn it first.
50 cents if you tell me
when anybody you've never seen
comes here to El Paso.
A stranger
just came out of the hotel.
Where's he staying?
The hotel.
- Let me know if you see any more.
- Sure, se単or.
- Help you, sir?
- I want the room above.
I'm sorry, it's occupied. Too bad.
The hotel's filled to capacity.
- Sorry, that room's always occupied.
- By who?
Check the register.
Mary!
It's Sr. Martinez.
- It's free now.
- It's taken!
I'll see to it.
Nothing but a wild, vicious animal.
He's tall, isn't he?
You're just dirty.
Quick, my bill!
I want my bill!
- Before he comes.
- Don't check out.
It'll be okay, Mr. Martinez.
I'll give you a better room.
Take the bridal suite.
- No, I'd like to stay alive.
- Don't go.
- I have an appointment.
- Sr. Martinez!
Yes, se単or, what do you want?
- I don't wear them.
- I'm honored you thought of me.
Watch this!
Hello, my friends.
Hello, amigo.
I didn't waste a minute coming.
Indio calls
and Groggy comes running.
Sancho?
If you're waiting for him,
I'll come in four years.
He's in prison. For four years.
No amor, no dinero, no sun.
Bad for him,
not so bad for the rest of us.
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect.
- What's it all about, huh?
- Now just listen.
A bank at El Paso.
Let's see. We'll say
this is the inside of the bank.
- Ni単o is the safe.
- Which even dynamite can't open.
There are the two cashiers.
This is the manager's desk.
In back
is a fancy cabinet with bottles
for offering drinks
to rich depositors.
There's the main door
and opposite it a double wall.
What happens, Groggy?
Say you've killed
the cashiers and the manager.
The next few minutes
you're the boss of the bank.
Now what?
Your time's been wasted, Indio.
A waste of time.
Especially to blast open
that damn iron safe.
We'd need so much dynamite
the bank would disappear.
And you'd all go up with it.
Besides,
the presence of a safe
doesn't mean there's money inside.
To help you understand what I mean
I would like to relate
a nice, little parable.
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter.
Don't think he makes money?
No? You're wrong.
This one did well.
Because he built safes.
There was a banker once.
He wanted his iron safe disguised
to look like a wood cabinet.
To get it made
he goes to our carpenter for the job.
And one day,
as destiny has it,
the carpenter's in El Paso.
He goes into the bank.
What does he find?
The cabinet! Since he'd worked on it
he spotted it right away.
From that day he couldn't work.
Pity, because...
there was something he had to do.
There was this crazy idea.
And it stayed.
And it stayed.
To put his hands on the money inside.
To get in and grab it all.
You think he was lucky
the way things worked out?
Going in just that bank?
It wasn't true.
His good fortune ran out.
Because later,
as a prisoner,
he ran into me.
The carpenter told me the story
and I tell you.
The money's right in this!
Almost a million dollars!
Your colleague told me this bank
has the state's largest deposits.
That's correct.
Here at the bank at El Paso
we have half a million in reserve.
I see. You sure it's secure enough
to hold that much?
With your money deposited here
you can sleep soundly.
Besides,
after closing an armed guard
and a patroller remain here.
The Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.
Exactly.
The truth is
to try robbing us would be so futile
that only a fool would attempt it.
Yeah.
Or a madman.
Get out of the way.
Get out of here!
More news, amigo.
Another stranger in town?
Yes. And I know something else.
There was another one
I didn't tell you about.
You sawed-off little runt.
- How many altogether?
- There were two, now there's four.
Where?
In the saloon.
Whisky.
Why choose my place
to commit suicide?
I know him.
It's a miracle you're alive.
Why carry a pistol
then take such an insult?
- It's strange.
- The hunchback didn't shoot you.
He had a very, very important reason.
That's all.
I was thinking that myself.
One, two...
three, and four and five...
Seis, siete,
ocho, nueve, diez...
Eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen,
eighteen, nineteen,
twenty, twenty-one,
twenty-two, twenty-three,
twenty-four,
twenty-five, twenty-six,
twenty-seven,
twenty-eight, twenty-nine,
thirty, thirty-one,
thirty-two and thirty-three.
No, no, no.
All right now.
I don't know him.
I don't know him!
You know everybody.
I don't know anybody anymore.
I'm dead.
There was a time I knew everybody.
Long ago, when all this was prairie.
These days everybody's in a hurry.
With your good-for-nothing trains.
Choo-choo-choo! Twee!
Disgusting!
A guy from the railroad comes.
He says,
"Railway's gonna go past your house."
"That so?", I said.
"That's right", he says,
"lots of trains are gonna pass.
You'd best sell to the company
or we'll buy Baker's.
He lives next door.
The tracks will make you go crazy.
Will you sell to us, Prophet?"
"Oh, is that so?", says I.
He was anxious for me to sell.
Know what I said about the railroad?
What I told him he could do with it?
Know what my decision was?
- You said no.
- You're right.
No to him and his damn trains.
I wouldn't, no!
Look. Listen to me, old man.
You're supposed to be a prophet,
not rattle on about trains.
It's obvious
you don't know anything.
No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came to do,
clear out before I lose my temper.
Hey! Where you going?
I'd better go before you get angry.
Why are you so damn stupid?
Give me that pistol there.
Right behind you.
Hurry!
Yes, yes. That's the one.
Now hand it over.
That's it.
The man you asked about.
How does he carry his gun?
Wears it across his belly?
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you say so?
Of course I know
who you're talking about. Of course.
Colonel Douglas Mortimer.
Mortimer.
A brave man, a soldier.
The best shot in the Carolinas.
A great soldier.
Reduced to a bounty killer.
Like you.
Because of trains.
Because of the damn trains,
damn them.
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leaving.
Hold it!
Take it back.
Take it to the station.
- Go inside.
- The station.
Like the games we know.
A trick maybe.
How can somebody in my business
carry a contraption like this?
That contraption
almost sent you to your grave.
You forget,
I was shooting at your hat.
Well, I was only shooting at yours.
I recall firing first.
Boy,
I've reached almost 50
with my system.
Men don't last long in these parts.
How long do you expect to last?
Much longer than that.
When I get my hands
on Indio and that $10,000
I'm going to buy a little place,
maybe retire.
Well, I don't think
we should start another fight.
- But you forget one small detail.
- What?
- I want to get my hands on him too.
- Sure.
After me.
Or before you.
Or at the same time.
- That a proposition?
- Uh-huh.
An equal partnership.
- Why should I?
- I can think of three reasons.
First, there's 14 of them.
Yeah. It's a lot.
- A lot for me.
- Yeah.
Even for two of us.
Second reason?
Second reason?
You could make it 15 to 1.
I want to play in this game too.
As you're aware.
Two hunters with the same prey
often shoot each other.
We don't want to shoot each other.
Then the Colonel dies.
All right. I'll be generous.
You have the reward for Indio.
I take the reward for the rest.
No.
All wrong.
Indio's worth $10,000.
The rest adds up to much more.
- Lucky four, Wild three, Ni単o two.
- Ni単o's one.
Well, Frisco's worth two.
That's 10,000.
Yeah, but there's a few more
that'll add up to more, I'm sure.
- How do you know?
- I have my information.
When all's said and done
I might take you up
on your proposition.
Let's drink to this partnership.
To the partnership.
With no tricks, of course.
No tricks.
Well.
We have to figure some way
to get them in the middle.
Yep.
One on the outside, one on the inside.
There's no other way.
One of us
will have to join Indio's band.
- Why look at me?
- They don't know you.
Wild sees me,
his hump will catch fire.
Tell me, Colonel. How do you propose
I join up with Indio?
Maybe bring him a bunch of roses?
You could do that, but I'd suggest
you take him Sancho Perez.
Who's he?
A friend of Indio's.
Now he's cooling off
in El Magordo jail.
How do you know all this?
I've got my information too.
Naturally you'll have to arrange
for his "release".
Naturally.
Tell me, Colonel.
Were you ever young?
Yep.
And just as reckless as you.
Then one day something happened.
- Made life very precious to me.
- What's that?
Is the question indiscreet?
No.
The question isn't indiscreet.
But the answer could be.
They told me you were put away.
For four long years.
No, Indio. For four weeks!
Just four weeks!
Sancho!
- Who is that with you?
- He got me out.
That man's a friend of mine.
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?
Amigo, why did you help me out?
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen
that I thought I'd tag along
on your next robbery.
I might just turn you in.
Amigo.
That's the one answer I'll accept.
And you arrived just in time.
The job's already set.
It's tomorrow.
The place is
the bank in El Paso.
Close to El Paso is a town,
Santa Cruz.
Tomorrow Blackey, Chico, Paco...
you, amigo
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.
Shoot, kill, get every gun after you.
Especially those from El Paso.
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.
After the job
we'll meet at Las Palmeras.
Where are you going?
If there's gonna be any shooting,
I got to get my rest.
Hey, amigo. When you told
that story yesterday I fell for it.
A big joke, wasn't it, amigo?
Who said it was?
- I don't get it. If it's true...
- You have to die.
What is it?
By now they should be at Santa Cruz.
Listen, shorty.
Indio's band
just robbed a bank here in town.
Why don't you send out the alarm
to El Paso and other towns around?
I didn't hear any shots.
- I would have.
- You might hear one.
The alarm.
Easy now.
They've robbed the bank
at Santa Cruz!
Follow me!
Look, the telegraph wires.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.
- Sir.
- Afternoon.
The other side.
Eleven, twelve,
Fourteen...
What are you doing?
Running away?
No, I'm going after them alone.
Our partnership is dissolved.
- Let's talk it over.
- All we've done is talk.
I've been fair with no results.
Take it easy.
We only knew about Santa Cruz.
You had their strategy
all worked out.
- I'm meeting Indio.
- I'm coming.
I'm going alone. Me!
- I won't let anyone else interfere.
- Sure about that?
That's right.
In that case, I'm sorry.
That's not bad.
Indio sent four men to Santa Cruz.
One returns. The new man.
Without a scratch.
Indio's no idiot.
Show him that nick,
he might believe you.
Don't forget, as of today
the gang's worth $40,000 more.
That's the bank's reward.
- Is the partnership operating again?
- How, do you figure?
Try to convince Indio to go North.
Then along the Rio Bravo.
- It's a good spot to ambush them.
- Yeah.
You on the outside,
Me on the inside, right?
Um-hm. North?
North.
Hughey.
Wait a minute.
We need time to open it. Not here.
- And the others? Dead?
- Yeah.
After Santa Cruz we headed
for El Paso and were ambushed.
Just saved yourself? You yellow...
You did your part of it.
- Let's go.
- Which way we headed?
- North.
- North?
Along Rio Bravo Canyon?
Why not?
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.
You know a better way?
Yeah. South.
Right to the border?
They'll never expect it
now that the alarm has been sent.
No. Think we'll head East.
There's a place I know.
Agua Caliente.
Here we are. That's Agua Caliente.
Yes, I have many friends here.
It looks just like a morgue.
Look at it.
It could be one so easily.
- They don't like strangers.
- They don't like anybody.
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?
No.
Did any of you?
We don't know
how you'd be in emergencies.
I was thinking, this is
the right place to show the men.
- How's that?
- Go into town alone, amigo.
Bravo.
You mind telling me
how you got here?
I just reasoned it out.
I figured you'd tell Indio to do
just the opposite of what we agreed.
And he's suspicious enough
to think of a new plan.
El Paso was out of the question
so here I am.
Rum, a double.
Tequila for all of us.
Well, well!
If it isn't the smoker.
Well!
Remember me, amigo?
Course you do.
El Paso.
Small world.
Yes. And very, very bad.
Now, come on.
You light another match.
I generally smoke after I eat.
Come back in about ten minutes.
By then you'll be smoking in hell.
Get up!
Stay calm.
On your feet!
Cuccillo,
count to three.
One...
Two...
Three!
Stop it!
Who are you?
The one who can open the safe.
What safe?
From El Paso. You beat me there.
However...
However?
Open that safe,
you'll ruin half the bills.
I can open it without blowing it up.
- What'll it cost?
- 5,000.
Two is all I'll pay you.
Five.
Keep your hands off it!
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is keeping it.
Take it out.
Every man in New Mexico is after us.
If they find one of us with some,
we're all done for.
We'll wait here
for a month if we need to.
Everybody gets his share.
You'll wait a month too.
Naturally.
I'll be in the tavern.
The air stinks here anyway.
Just like the food.
But the month will go fast.
All right.
Right here.
Let's go.
I was worried about you.
All alone
with so many problems to solve.
It's all right here.
Go ahead.
You shouldn't have shot the apples.
Put it on.
Stop it!
See that they're tied
and keep an eye on them.
Why let them alone?
- All things at the right time.
- What do you mean?
Looking for the cash from the bank.
Right.
And suppose he finds their bodies
just outside El Paso?
With lots of money on them?
- What will the sheriff think?
- Well...
That's right.
Slim.
What is it, Ni単o?
Change of plans.
Indio wants you to...
It's not loaded.
You should get out fast.
Here's your guns. Without bullets.
Don't let Indio find you.
I know you don't like questions,
but why are you doing this?
Ni単o, how long have you known
that Manco's a bounty killer?
I found out tonight. Why?
I knew he was one
from the moment he arrived.
The other one's also a bounty killer.
So I have an idea.
They'll be useful to us.
We'll try it.
Those men are a lot better than mine
with a gun.
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.
But that won't really matter. To me.
Or you.
Because we'll be far away, right?
And we'll have all the money.
Go on.
Go on and wake Cuccillo.
- Who did it?
- Why don't you look at the knife?
- It's mine.
- It shouldn't be there, should it?
I didn't kill him. I didn't do it.
Cuccillo.
- It's difficult to prove that.
- Indio.
I'm innocent.
One horse is outside.
Let's see if you can get to it.
Indio?
Cuccillo...
killed Slim.
And he helped
those bounty killers get away.
I...
I want them back.
Right now.
Right now.
Right now!
What are you doing?
Go on, get them back!
Groggy.
Those bounty killers are sitting
on our backs. They must be killed.
We can't let them go free.
It's done now.
Prepare to get out of here.
- Here, Ni単o.
- Indio!
Not a bad idea, Indio.
But I'm one thing you forgot about.
Open it up now.
All right, come on now. Open it.
Leave Indio to me.
All right.
Where in hell is it?
I'll kill them
but I'll rip out their guts first.
I have a plan, Groggy.
What?
Let's just wait.
They'll be back.
- This way there'll be two of us.
- Can they come back?
- Your men could have killed them.
- Who, they?
You sure? That they haven't?
I thought differently.
You made the boys ride out to ensure
they're both killed. Fast.
- I'm not as dumb as the rest, Indio.
- There was no help for it.
Go on.
That watch.
It's been a long time
that I wanted to ask.
I can see it means
a lot to you, Indio. Why?
Listen to me.
This is Colonel Mortimer.
Douglas Mortimer.
The name mean anything to you?
When the chimes end,
pick up your gun.
Try and shoot me, Colonel.
Just try.
Very careless, old man.
Try this.
Now we start.
Bravo.
Seems to be a family resemblance.
Here.
Naturally,
between brother and sister.
My gun.
My boy.
You've become rich.
- You mean we've become rich.
- It's all for you.
You deserve it.
What about our partnership?
Maybe next time.
Ten thousand, twelve thousand,
fifteen,
sixteen,
seventeen,
twenty-two.
Twenty-two?
Twenty-seven.
Any trouble, boy?
No, old man.
Thought I was having trouble
with my adding.
It's all right now.
