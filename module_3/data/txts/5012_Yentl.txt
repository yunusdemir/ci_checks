- Morning.
- Good morning.
When I was in Lublin studying last week,
I found this wonderful book.
Can you believe the price of cabbage?
For instance, he gives 25 different
interpretations of Genesis alone.
Best in the market. Parsnip,
turnip, everything for soup.
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.
Lovely picture books for women.
...in each sentence.
Fish, fish. Fishy fish.
- Mama.
- Rachel.
Fish. Fish.
Come, look at this.
Look at this, ladies. Look at this.
Fine herring, carp,
beautiful silver carp.
- Delicious, delicious.
- See the difference?
The skin should be tight, firm,
and the scales shiny like diamonds.
Yentl, how's Papa?
- He's much better, thank you.
- Good, good.
And then there's the smell.
Lovely picture books for women,
sacred books for men.
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.
Yentl? Yentl, what would
you like to have?
Yentl, a pike or a carp?
- Fine. Fine.
- A nice carp.
Novels for women, sacred books for men.
Picture books for women...
Yentl, what's this I hear?
You finally got engaged.
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Did you or didn't you?
- What, hear about it or do it?
If she can make jokes about finding a
husband at her age, I shouldn't worry.
Here you are, darling.
So beautiful, it'll cook itself.
And what's so funny?
What are you laughing about?
- Are you going to buy my fish today?
- I'll eat chicken.
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.
Yentl, did you hear about Helen Shipman?
- I haven't got time today.
- You never do.
- Buy your gruel.
- Novels for women, sacred books for men.
Lovely picture books for women.
So, in the second part,
he relates the mysticism of creation
to the mysticism of language.
There are things in here we
shouldn't even be reading.
- Can we afford it?
- No, but we can read it.
There's one in the rabbi's study.
Come on.
What a nice girl. There's your change.
- You're in the wrong place, miss.
- What?
Books for women are over here.
- Novels, very romantic.
- I'd like to buy this one, please.
- Sacred books are for men.
- Why?
- It's a law, that's why.
- Where is it written?
Never mind where. It's a law.
Well, if it's a law, it must be written
somewhere, maybe in here. I'll take it.
Miss, do me a favor.
Do yourself a favor.
Here, buy a nice picture book.
- Girls like picture books.
- What if I told you it's for my father?
Why didn't you say? Fifteen kopecks.
And if you want to know where
that's written, it's inside the cover.
Thank you.
Good. And who's wise?
- He who knows a lot.
- No, try again. Who's wise?
- He who...
- He who learns from all men.
- He who learns from all men?
- Good. And who's rich?
- Who's rich? Oh, I know that one.
- You know?
He who has a full heart.
He who is content with what he has.
Yentl, is dinner almost ready?
Yes, he who has a full heart, and also,
he who is content with what he has.
But, Reb Mendel, how can one
question have two answers?
David, sometimes there are
many answers to the same question.
Now, the last one. Who is strong?
- Strong...
- No, no, no. Who is strong?
- He who controls his passions.
- Concentrate, David.
Controls his passions.
- Try, David.
- I'm trying.
- He who...
- He who controls his passions!
Yentl knows Talmud?
I think that's enough for today.
My father says that a woman
who studies Talmud is a demon.
She's not a demon.
She just has big ears.
So you don't have to mention
this to your father.
- Goodbye, Reb Mendel.
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Bye, David.
- See you tonight.
Now you'll have the whole
village talking about us.
Papa, you shouldn't be smoking.
Do you think the angel of death will be
frightened away by cough medicine?
Open.
In the first place, you don't
have to drown him in it.
Again.
And in the second place,
I think he's beginning to like it.
- Oh, you want some more?
- Yentl.
You know something?
Baked apple is good a little burnt.
- I'm sorry, Papa.
- No, no, no. I mean it. I like it this way.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
Go on, your move.
Papa?
Why is it that every book I buy,
every bookseller who comes
has the same old argument?
- You know why.
- I envy them.
- The booksellers?
- No, not the booksellers, the students.
Talking about life,
the mysteries of the universe.
And I'm learning how to
tell a herring from a carp.
Yentl, for the thousandth time,
men and women
- have different obligations.
- Have different obligations, I know, but...
And don't ask why.
Go on. Get the books.
- Get the books.
- Thank you, Papa.
- "Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Papa."
- Thank you.
- The shutters, darling.
- The shutters.
If we don't have to hide my studying
from God, then why from the neighbors?
Why? Because I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.
Questions, questions,
even when you were little.
- "Does a goat have a soul?"
- Does it?
- "What was before the universe?"
- I'd really like to know.
- Where were we?
- We were up to Hillel's argument.
Hillel's argument that knowledge...
Papa?
Papa?
Papa, I'm a little tired tonight.
Do you mind? We'll study tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Oh, Yentl, Yentl. Oh, Yentl.
You're such a comfort to me.
But you should have a young
man to take care of you,
preferably one who doesn't like to eat.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Papa.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Fine, fine.
God, our merciful father,
I'm wrapped in a robe of light,
clothed in your glory
that spreads its wings over my soul.
May I be worthy.
Amen
There's not a morning I begin
Without a thousand questions
running through my mind
That I don't try to find
the reason and the logic
In the world that God designed
The reason why
A bird was given wings
If not to fly
And praise the sky
With every song it sings
What's right or wrong
Where I belong
Within the scheme of things
And why have eyes that
see and arms that reach
Unless you're meant to know
there's something more?
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all
Then tell me what a soul is for
Why have the wings
unless you're meant to fly?
And tell me, please, why have a mind
If not to question why?
And tell me where
Where is it written
what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare
To have the chance to pick
the fruit of every tree
Or have my share
Of every sweet imagined possibility?
Just tell me where
Tell me where
If I were only meant to tend the nest
Then why does my imagination sail
Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe
of any fairy tale?
Why have the thirst if
not to drink the wine?
And what a waste to have a taste
Of things that can't be mine
And tell me where
Where is it written
what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare
To find the meanings in
the mornings that I see
Or have my share
Of every sweet imagined possibility?
Papa!
Just tell me where
Where is it written?
Tell me where
Are you all right?
Or if it's written
Anywhere
Did you hear, Albert?
- Yentl is learning Talmud.
- Learning Talmud?
- That's impossible.
- It's true.
- David's mother told me. He was there.
- It can't be.
Better she should learn
how to get a husband.
He came all the way
from Riga to see you.
So, why, Yentl, why won't
you at least meet him?
- What for?
- "What for?"
I want to dance at your wedding.
I want to see you happy.
I'm happy with you, Papa.
- I don't want to get married now.
- I noticed.
I don't want to just bear children
and darn my husband's socks.
What is it you want?
A husband who will darn your socks?
- Sounds interesting.
- And bear your children?
Go on, turn the world
upside down and inside out.
- You won't have a moment's peace.
- I didn't say I never wanted...
Children are more important
than the Talmud.
Without children to pass it on to,
the learning, the studying, the Talmud
dies with old men when they die.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm the one who's sorry.
You're a woman, but I didn't
teach you how to be one.
- You taught me everything I know.
- Too much you know.
You know too much, but not enough.
- And it's my fault.
- Papa, please, don't say that.
Learning is my whole life.
Please don't be sorry. I'm not.
- What is it?
- That tree.
That tree was this high when your brother
Anshel died, may he rest in peace.
You were only a baby, could hardly
talk, let alone ask, "Why?"
And now, look, look how it's grown.
Too late to tell you to
play with dolls, huh?
- I love you, Papa.
- Please...
Hear me, O Lord, master of the universe.
Thou hast given me a daughter
who brings me great pride and pleasure.
And for this kindness,
I thank thee forever and ever.
What's to become of you, Yentl?
Come, Yentl.
You must tear it over your heart.
- Good.
- Who will say Kaddish?
- I will.
- It has to be a man, Yentl, a male relative.
May God forgive her.
Listen, my house is hers
as long as she wants.
So she'll help a little in the store,
look after the children,
maybe do a little cooking...
Yentl, eat.
It's enough.
We mourn for seven days only.
Then life goes on.
Sorry.
Razel, Sarah, I think
maybe we come back later.
Yes.
Get your things together, Yentl.
I'll come back for you later.
Believe me, I'll keep you so busy,
you won't have time to think.
Forgive me, Papa.
Wait!
- Wait! Stop!
- Whoa.
- Please.
- What do you want, boy?
Could you give me a ride
to the next town, please?
- You got money?
- A little.
- Get in back.
- Thank you.
Say, where do you think you're going?
- Get off of here.
- Wait!
- Go find another wagon. Tomorrow.
- Wait! Please wait!
God
Our heavenly father
O God
And my father, who's also in heaven
May the light of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night,
the way your spirit
Illuminates my soul
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now that
yesterday has waved goodbye
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much
bigger now that I'm alone
Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night
is filled with voices?
I remember everything you taught me
Every book I've ever read
Can all the words in all the books
help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
and I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright
Papa, how I love you
Papa, how I need you
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me
Good night
If I am not for myself,
who will be for me?
Who will be for me?
Who will be for me?
If I am for myself alone, who am I?
Who am I?
If not now, when?
Wait!
Innkeeper, more soup.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. I hear, I hear.
- Who's throwing that?
- I need some more fish.
- Don't throw that. I told you not to.
- Watch out!
Lithuania, Poland,
all yeshivas are the same.
A school is a school.
I mean, it's only the rabbis that
are different. I mean, the girls...
- Why would the Talmud repeat itself, why?
- Because it's an improper translation.
- Even if they contradict each other?
- Avigdor, what do you think?
The Talmud recognizes life
is filled with contradiction.
- You see? He agrees with me.
- Your move.
Two beers.
I can hear you. I only have two hands.
What?
- Nothing, sorry.
- No, go on.
It's just that if you move
your castle to queen seven...
- Yes?
- His knight is pinned. That's all.
You don't know what
you're talking about.
No. Sorry.
- Stop yelling at me, Papa.
- I'm not yelling! I'm not yelling!
Checkmate.
- The long diagonal. Who knew?
- You should've listened to him.
Pay up.
Chaim, catch.
- You want a bite?
- No, thank you.
- Don't play.
- Hey, you. You.
- Sit down.
- Why?
Because I said so. Sit.
Five kopecks if you win.
You pay me one if you lose.
What do I have to do?
Whoever forces the other's
hand to the table wins.
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Ready? Go.
Wasn't it Rabbi Akiva who said,
"The true strength of a man..."
One kopeck.
"...lies in his ability to stretch even
the narrowest mind"? Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now you can stretch my mind again.
- Go.
- Well,
I think Rabbi Akiva also said...
Two kopecks.
- I thought it was one.
- But I beat you twice.
Give him back his money.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
Because you said so.
I'll see you later when your beard
starts to grow. Mama's boy.
No, it wasn't, since you asked.
Rabbi Akiva, "The narrowest mind."
- Was it Rabbi Eliezer?
- No, it was Rabbi Israel Salanter.
Rabbi Israel Salanter.
By the way, my brother
didn't have one, either.
What?
- Are you hungry?
- A little.
- Help yourself.
- Yes, please. Help yourself.
- Which yeshiva are you going to?
- I haven't decided. Someplace quiet.
A quiet yeshiva?
- Bechev's the best.
- Well, the nearest.
That's where we study.
Everybody else studies.
Me, I just count the days
till I go home again.
And his parents count the days
till they can send him back again.
Our rabbi's a genius. Rabbi Zalman.
Maybe you've heard of him?
- I think so.
- In one answer, he settles 10 questions.
My father had 10 questions
for every answer.
Had?
He died eight days ago,
may he rest in peace.
- You're in mourning, too.
- My brother.
Almost a month now.
May he rest in peace.
I'm Shimmele, by the way.
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- And you?
- What?
What's your name?
- My name?
- Name.
Anshel. That's it. That's my name.
My name is Anshel.
Well, good. You know your own name.
You're as good a scholar as I am.
- This is Avigdor.
- I know.
- I mean, hello.
- Boys!
Wagons to the north
and west leaving now.
- And now means now.
- Goodbye.
Bye, Anshel, nice meeting you.
Come on, then. We don't want to be late.
Anshel!
- Hey, are you deaf? Anshel!
- Anshel. Yes?
There's a spare seat in the wagon
if you're still undecided.
I just decided.
In Plzen there's a fisherman
who's got the strongest rod
The cod he catches are so big and
when they see his cod they scream
Where you from, Anshel?
A little village you've probably
never heard of. Yanev.
Yanev? I have relatives in Yanev,
a third cousin.
- We moved.
- What?
Years ago.
- You have relatives in Riga?
- Riga?
- No.
- Now we live in Riga.
Were you close?
Well, he was my father and my teacher.
- What more could you ask for?
- What about your brother?
- We were brothers.
- Older? Younger?
- Younger, about your age.
- What happened?
- Pneumonia.
- Sorry.
Would you like to discuss
a page of Talmud?
- Oh, no, not Talmud.
- Which?
- Whatever you're reading.
- I'll state the premise. You dispute it.
You know it by heart?
When does day become night?
- Sundown.
- When is sundown?
Sundown is when you can see
the first three stars in the sky.
- That's not precise enough.
- Why?
When's dusk?
- Dusk is when the light's no longer blue.
- That's twilight.
No, twilight is when all
objects are silhouettes.
Will you be quiet for five minutes?
You're not even in the yeshiva yet.
There's Bechev! We're home!
How do I get into this yeshiva?
Rabbi Zalman tests you
on what you know or what
you think you know.
- I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow.
- Will I be able to live at this yeshiva?
Not at this one.
Don't worry, you'll find lodgings.
There may be a room where I stay.
We'll ask.
- I'm starving.
- You're always starving.
- Wait for me.
- Come on, you're walking too slow.
You're walking too fast.
The synagogue's down
the street to the left.
The yeshiva's straight ahead.
I live right around this corner.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Avigdor?
- How many other boyfriends do you have?
I'm so glad you're back.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.
Well, as soon as you see Hadass,
you'll feel better.
- Who wants other girls when I've got you?
- What a shame, a wicked tongue.
I want you to meet a
friend of mine, Anshel.
- Anshel, Mrs. Jacobs.
- Good evening, Mrs. Jacobs.
- Anshel?
- I told him that you'd have a room for him.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, not tonight.
My niece is here from Latvia,
but she leaves tomorrow.
It's all right. For one night,
he can share my bed.
- No, I can't.
- Why not?
- I don't want to impose.
- Don't be silly.
- Anyway, I'm a restless sleeper.
- That's all right. I snore.
Come on.
Young.
Anshel, will you put out the lamp?
I can't. I'm being tested
by the rabbi tomorrow.
So? You're going to learn the
entire Talmud by heart overnight?
All 2,555 pages?
- You're tired, you sleep.
- I'm not tired, I'm exhausted.
I've been bouncing around in a wagon
all day long. All I want to do is sleep.
Get in bed.
- Would you like to talk a little before...
- Bed.
- Why don't I just put the light...
- Get in bed.
So...
Who's Hadass?
- Mrs. Jacobs mentioned somebody...
- For God's sake.
Sorry. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
Go back to sleep.
The girl I'm engaged to.
Sorry.
Oh, it's your suitcase.
- Is she pretty, this Hadass?
- No. Beautiful.
What color hair does she have?
Look, I have dinner at her house
every Tuesday. I'll take you.
Thank you.
- Red.
- Red?
- Now, will you get into bed?
- Sure.
You'll fall off the edge.
I always sleep like this.
- Why?
- Why?
I think it's written.
What is?
Two bachelors in the same
bed must lie back to back.
- Really?
- Really. So turn over, please.
Why'd you have to talk about Hadass?
Now I'll never get to sleep.
- Why not?
- Don't you ever think sinful thoughts?
- No.
- No?
- Yes!
- Don't be so nervous.
Why should I be nervous?
You're being tested
by the rabbi tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night.
I'll see you in class, okay?
No, Anshel, the whole point of study
is to teach us how to live,
not only to study.
- But why?
- "Why? Why?" Again, "Why?"
No, I mean, excuse me, but my father
used to quote Hillel, who said... May I?
- Hillel said, "May I?"
- No, I mean, may I quote Hillel?
Quote, quote.
Well, Hillel said, "He that
increases wisdom increases life."
- Exactly.
- Meaning that
wisdom is the most important thing.
Only as the means to an end.
Wisdom is the means. Living is the end.
Well, in that case,
may I ask you another question?
Ask, ask.
Well, if Hillel said,
"He that increases study
increases wisdom,
"and he that increases wisdom
increases life," then...
- Grab it.
- You can't just grab it.
- You're supposed to...
- No, that's not it.
You can do it, so long as...
That's why Rabbi Akiva says
you must use the left side.
No, I disagree.
- Well?
- I don't know. He just said to me...
- He asks a lot of questions, this one.
- I'm sorry, I've been told that before.
It's by their questions that
we choose our students,
not only by their answers.
Your father taught you well, Anshel.
Welcome to our yeshiva.
I'm accepted?
I'm a student?
- I'm a student.
- And now, a study partner for him.
There are moments
you remember all your life
There are moments you wait for
and dream of all your life
This is one of those moments
I will always remember
this chair that window
The way the light streams in
He's too advanced for them.
The clothes I'm wearing
The words I'm hearing
Too advanced for Yessel and Berish.
The face I'm seeing
So who?
The feeling I'm feeling
- Me?
- You?
The smell, the sounds
My chickens are too advanced for you.
Will be written on my mind
- Thank you.
- Avigdor?
Will be written in my heart
There's only me who is
too advanced for him.
It's up to you.
As long as I live
We'll see.
I can travel the past and take what
I need to see me through the years
What my father learned
and his father before him
Will be there for my eyes and ears
I can walk through the forests
of the trees of knowledge
And listen to the lesson of the leaves
I can enter rooms where there
are rooms within rooms
Wrapped in a shawl that learning weaves
I remember, Papa
Everything you've taught me
What you gave me, Papa
Look at what it's brought me
There are certain things
that once you have
No man can take away
No wave can wash away
No wind can blow away
And now they're about to be mine
No tide can turn away
No fire can burn away
No time can wear away
I can open doors, take from the shelves
all the books I've longed to hold
I can ask all the questions
the whys and the wheres
As the mysteries of life unfold
Like a link in a chain from
the past to the future
Joins me with the children yet to be
I can now be a part of the ongoing stream
That has always been a part of me
There are certain things
that once you have
No man can take away
No wave can wash away
No wind can blow away
Anshel, come down.
No tide can turn away
No fire can burn away
No time can wear away
Where in the Talmud does it say,
"Possession is nine-tenths of the law"?
Shimmele.
- Yebamoth?
- No.
- No, it's not Yebamoth. It's Bava Metzia.
- No.
- It's Bava Kama, page 29A.
- No.
Forgive me. It's Bava Kama,
but it's 31B?
Anshel is right.
There are moments you
remember all your life
There are moments you wait for
and dream of all your life
This is one of those moments
Perfect.
Beautiful.
So, congratulations, Anshel.
Accepted in a fine yeshiva.
- Your father would be proud.
- I hope so.
Sure.
- I understand he was a scholar, too?
- Yes, yes, he was.
Now his son after him.
May your father rest in peace.
- May he rest in peace.
- May he rest in peace.
Avigdor's brother, too. He told you?
- Yes, he did.
- Consumption, a terrible thing.
Esther!
- At our table, two scholars waiting.
- I'm coming.
I'd like to have a toast
to the new yeshiva boy.
Such an honor.
- How is the fish, boys?
- Delicious.
- Hadass made it herself.
- It's Avigdor's favorite.
I hope so. We get it every Tuesday.
I mean, it's very good. It's good fish.
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Vishkower.
Such beautiful things, the silver,
the dishes, the tablecloth.
Thank you, Anshel.
It's nice of you to notice.
Oh. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
You... You come from a big family?
- No.
- No brothers or sisters?
- No.
- And your father never remarried?
- No.
- Esther.
Well, I'm just curious.
I mean, who took care of them?
If I knew Talmud the way my wife knows
everybody's business, God bless her,
I'd be the sage of all sages.
Don't you pay any attention to him.
No wonder he loves her
No wonder at all
The moment she sees him
Her thought is to please him
Horseradish is good for you.
Before he even knows that he's hungry
she's already there with his plate
Before his glass is even empty
She's filling it up
God forbid he should wait
Before he has the chance to tell her
he's chilly, she'll go put a log on the fire
- Anshel?
- Anshel.
Fulfilling his every desire
More bread, please.
No trouble
Yes, more bread.
No bother
- Carrots?
- No, thank you.
No wonder she's pretty
What else should she be?
She hasn't a worry
And why should she worry?
When she gets up, her biggest
decision is figuring out what to wear
To pick a blouse, a skirt
And then there's the problem
Of what should she do with her hair
And later as she stands
and studies a chicken
The question's to roast or to not roast
Or better yet, maybe a pot roast
Tomatoes? No
Potatoes.
No wonder he likes it
It's perfect this way
Who wouldn't want someone
who fusses and flatters
Who makes you feel that
you're all that matters
Whose only aim in life is to serve you
And make you think she
doesn't deserve you?
No wonder he loves her
It's all right. It happens.
All the time.
What else could he do?
If I were a man
I would, too
- Let's try dessert.
- Yes, Mother.
Good?
Let's go this way.
She makes the best almond cakes,
doesn't she?
I thought it was pneumonia.
- Your brother.
- It was.
- Vishkower said consumption.
- Did he?
They were very impressed
with you in there.
"Beautiful dishes, beautiful home."
I didn't open my mouth the first
two months I went, except to eat.
Is she always that nervous?
She's a girl in love.
What do you expect?
- She doesn't say very much, does she?
- What does she have to say?
Don't you ever wonder
what she's thinking?
No. What could she be thinking?
Anyway, I don't need her to think.
I can do that with you.
You're wrong, Avigdor.
It's a mistranslation.
The Hebrew for rib never meant rib.
It meant side.
- Rib, side, what's the difference?
- All the difference in the world.
Since Adam was created
both male and female...
- Where's that written?
- Genesis, chapter five, verse two.
And if God took one side of Adam
and not his rib and created woman,
that means they're the same.
We all are, everybody is. Don't you see?
What I see is you've
never been with a woman.
What I mean is that they share
masculine and feminine qualities
since they come from the same source.
- Look, can you do that?
- What?
Create life, give birth to sons?
When you can do that,
then you tell me we're the same.
- Give me back my book.
- Another interpretation,
the true story of Adam and Eve,
Genesis Rabba 18.
God didn't make her from Adam's ear
lest she be an eavesdropper.
- Come on, please.
- Nor from his foot lest she be a wanderer.
Nor from his heart,
so she wouldn't be jealous.
Must you talk with your hands?
But from a hidden part of the body,
so she'd be modest.
- Stop it.
- Like my Hadass.
- In other words, the rib.
- No, not the rib. Not the rib, ox head,
- side! Side!
- Rib! Rib!
- Side!
- Rib, rib. Admit it. Admit you're wrong.
- Admit it! Admit it!
- I will not. I'm not wrong.
- Admit it!
- Get off me. I can't breathe.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
Come on.
- Where are you going?
- Come on!
Avigdor, wait.
Avigdor!
- Avigdor, where are you?
- Over here!
- Come on in.
- Oh, my God.
That's a bit funny, though.
- Come on in!
- No.
There's a passage here that...
- It's the only way to cool off.
- No, it's all right.
I'll... I'll watch the clothes.
- Don't throw me in the water.
- Look at this fish I've caught.
- Shimmele, come on in.
- Shimmele, come on in.
- Hey, Avigdor, how's the water?
- It's good. It's fun.
It feels wonderful.
- You're really missing something.
- Am I?
- The water's perfect.
- Is it?
- Here, your pants.
- What a day.
- Put on your pants.
- What a pleasure.
- It must be a sin.
- It couldn't be.
Anshel! Come on in.
- That's enough studying.
- No, no, it's too cold.
- The water's warm.
- No, I catch cold easily.
- That's not the reason.
- It's not?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What? What? Tell you what?
You can't swim.
I can't swim. That's right. I can't swim.
I can't swim, Shimmele!
Neither can I. That's why
I stay where it's shallow.
- Come on, Anshel. I'll teach you.
- No. No, no.
- Don't be afraid.
- I don't really want to learn.
- I'll hold you.
- No. I don't like swimming.
- Take off your clothes. I'll hold you.
- No. Stop it.
- Take your clothes off.
- No, no.
- You're gonna get all wet. Oh, stop it.
- Please, stop it.
- Are you ashamed? Embarrassed?
- I don't want to.
- All right, all right.
- I don't want to. Stop it!
All right, all right.
If you're that scared...
I'm not going to force you.
- Next time.
- Sure.
When you're ready.
There's no chill and yet I shiver
There's no flame and yet I burn
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of
And yet I'm trembling
There's no storm, yet I hear thunder
And I'm breathless, why, I wonder
Weak one moment, then the next I'm fine
I feel as if I'm falling
every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body
is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine
What are all these new sensations?
What's the secret they reveal?
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel
Oh, why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there?
The water shining on his skin
the sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can never share with him
I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him
And the way he makes me feel?
I like the way
He makes me
Feel
Which is the greater crime,
stealing by day or by night?
- By day.
- By night.
- What's wrong?
- That's what I want to know.
Every morning, by the time we reach here,
you've exhausted the five books of Moses,
the six orders of the Mishnah,
the seven wonders of the world
and the entire mystery of the universe.
This morning, not a word. What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- Just like my brother.
In a little world of your own half the time.
Not saying what's on your mind, moody.
- Who's moody?
- Worried about something?
- No.
- Studies?
- Nothing, Avigdor.
- I'm your study partner.
- You should tell me if you are.
- I'm not.
With me sitting next to you,
what have you got to worry about?
- Please.
- I know what's wrong.
Come on, I'll take you
to the matchmaker.
- It'll put you in a better mood.
- I'm not going to a matchmaker.
Give you something soft
and round and sweet.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Sophie.
- Avigdor, please.
My future father-in-law
would like to see me.
Well, we're eating there tonight.
- He wants to see me now.
- What for?
Dowry, wedding ceremony,
the wedding night.
- Why do you keep grabbing me?
- What?
You're always grabbing me.
- No, I'm not.
- Well, yes, you are.
So? Everything has to have a reason?
The wedding night!
- Hello, Sophie. Is Avigdor here?
- Hello.
He... Excuse me.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Anshel, I'm sorry.
You're still welcome here,
no matter what's happened.
Sophie will get you something to eat.
Where's Avigdor?
Excuse me, Reb Alter, but...
Hadass, sweetheart, try to understand.
Avigdor.
I just came from...
- What happened?
- The wedding's off.
Why?
He says I have the evil eye.
Says a streak of melancholy
runs in our blood.
What are you saying?
No man can let his daughter
marry into a family like that.
It's forbidden.
Avigdor, I have no idea
what you're talking about.
- They found out.
- What?
- About my brother.
- What about your brother?
He didn't die of pneumonia
or consumption. I lied.
He committed suicide.
Oh, my God.
So no wedding. No sons.
What's all this for?
- Did you talk to Hadass?
- What for?
She loves you, Avigdor.
She'll still marry you.
Not if her parents say no.
Yes, she can. If she thinks her
parents are wrong, she can.
Come on, Anshel. You think it's so easy.
She's a woman.
- What does that have to do...
- She can't think for herself.
That's nonsense. Not all...
Please, Anshel, this isn't a time
for a philosophical argument.
I've lost the one girl that I've
ever loved, that I'll ever love.
You want to sit here and argue?
You'll fall in love again.
No.
Hadass is a nice girl, but don't
make her into more than she is.
No, I'm not.
She was exactly what I wanted.
Please don't.
I'm sorry.
Is this really happening, Anshel?
Maybe someone else will turn up for you.
Maybe not quite as pretty,
maybe with brown hair.
I wouldn't notice her if she did.
Why do you punish him for
something his brother did?
- Anshel, please.
- Hadass should be proud to be his wife.
You should be proud
to be his father-in-law.
Anshel.
They love each other.
That's all that matters.
No, that's not all.
There are other things.
- Don't talk old wives' tales. Talk the law.
- I'll talk more than the law. I'll talk life!
What matters is a man's children.
It's his children that your
law exists for, her children.
That's her only dowry,
and my obligation as her father.
I have one daughter.
I want the best for her.
Avigdor is the best.
The best scholar, maybe the best friend,
but not the best choice.
We want someone from a good family,
someone with no secrets to hide.
Someone like...
Someone else.
Anshel.
A little more?
In the middle of the night,
he goes to school.
- What did you have for dinner?
- What did I have for dinner?
- Very little.
- And Hadass?
- She's still in love. What do you expect?
- How did she look?
Not as bad as you do.
You didn't miss anything.
It was like a madhouse.
- The whole family's going crazy.
- What do you mean?
Well, it's just that...
I'm sure Reb Alter... I mean, to save face,
they're going to try to marry her off...
After a broken engagement,
they have to. It's usual.
- Did they mention someone?
- No, no.
But you should have seen the
way they were looking at me.
You?
Can you imagine? It shows
you how desperate they are.
- What's the matter? What?
- The books.
Avigdor? What's the matter?
That's a sin. What are you doing?
Avigdor, please,
just tell me what's happening.
- The books.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Where is it?
- What are you looking for?
- Here it is.
- What's the matter? Please?
- Sit down. Sit down.
Avigdor, just...
Anshel, I'm going to make you
the happiest man in the world.
- Yes?
- Anshel, it is the law, and it's written.
- And you like everything written.
- What's written, Avigdor?
It's the perfect solution.
We are like brothers.
If one dies, it is the other's
obligation to marry his widow.
- Who's died? No one's died.
- I want you to marry Hadass.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
Never, Avigdor, I couldn't, never...
- Why not?
- Why not?
- She loves you. That's why not.
- Listen. Let me explain.
Anyway, you're not dead.
Hadass isn't a widow,
and I'm not your brother.
- In my eyes, you are.
- In my eyes, you're crazy.
I don't want to marry her!
I don't want to marry anyone.
- I don't love her. I can't...
- I know. That's good.
- Good. What are you talking about?
- Will you listen?
No, I don't want to listen.
Don't you see? It's fate.
It's meant to be.
Nothing's meant to be.
We make what's meant to be.
Anshel, the thought of her with
another man is driving me crazy.
- Aren't I another man?
- Yes, but not a total stranger.
You marrying her would be the
nearest thing to me marrying her.
- I don't want to discuss it any further.
- Think of her for a moment.
They may marry her off to someone
she doesn't even know, let alone love.
- She could never love me.
- So she could never love you.
She likes you.
She is comfortable with you.
I could see her. I could visit you both.
- The three of us could be together...
- Avigdor, you're talking like a madman.
Don't let them take her away from me.
I'll never see her again.
- Wait, think of you then.
- I am. I am.
- She'll take care of you.
- No.
- A wealthy family, a beautiful girl...
- No! No!
Why do you always have to be different?
Please, that's enough!
Your room is downstairs.
What's the matter with you?
Any other man would...
Anshel, time will go by.
Tempers cool, things change.
Who knows? Perhaps even her father.
Your marriage could be dissolved.
Hadass and I could be...
She means that much to you?
Who better will you find?
Who better will she find?
- Do it, for all of us.
- I can't. It's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
Just think about it.
I've thought. It's out of the question.
The answer is no.
Another question.
Do you feel anything for me?
- What?
- Do you?
Of course I do.
Then think again.
More noodles? They're your favorite.
- How do you know?
- You told me last week at dinner.
- I don't remember.
- I do.
It's a little chilly in here.
I thought it was rather warm myself.
Yes, it is warm, for this time of year.
No wonder she suits him
She never disputes him
Last year, it was also warm.
The conversation's not too exciting
But, oh, what a change it must be
To spend an evening where
there's no conversation
Must be a relief after me
I'll get dessert.
And though there's nothing much
to challenge your mind here
Who cares when the food's so delicious?
Not to mention these beautiful dishes
A matched set
From France yet
- You look pensive.
- No, I was just thinking.
About me?
As a matter of fact, I was.
Good thoughts, I hope.
Something smells good. What is it?
It must be the cinnamon
in the baked apple.
You bake apples, too?
No wonder he loves her
No wonder to me
- A cushion?
- Why not?
With ribbons and laces
In all the right places
- Milk or lemon?
- Yes, please.
I must admit it's all very pleasant
and this is a comfortable room
- Which?
- Which what?
And if he likes the smell
of lilacs and roses
Then maybe he likes her perfume
Lemon or milk?
And though her silky hair
and milky complexion are nice
Still, they're not that distracting
- Anshel?
- Milky.
- What?
- Milk, milk, milk!
So what accounts for the
way he's been acting?
Honey?
Her softness
No honey.
Her sweetness
Sugar?
How could he resist her?
An almond cookie?
And why would he try?
How do you get them all the same size?
No wonder he wants her
You notice everything.
He needs her
The china. Cookies.
No wonder
That's really wonderful.
So would I
Where are your parents, Hadass?
Maybe they'd like some tea.
They're in the study
having tea with a guest.
This one's from Zamosc.
Yesterday, there were two
from Tolmachev, even older.
Well, I really have to be going.
I may have to leave Bechev if they
don't find someone for me here.
I'm sure they'll find someone.
I mean, who wouldn't want you?
- I mean...
- Don't you ever think about marriage?
No, no, no. I just think
about my studies.
- I admire that in a man.
- That's very good. Well...
Good night.
Good night.
He's not there, Anshel.
He's gone. He took his things and left.
Hurry.
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.
- Avigdor, don't leave, please. I was wrong.
- You?
- Fight for her. She's worth fighting for.
- It's no use.
- Talk to Vishkower.
- I tried. He won't listen.
Well, let's go see the rabbi.
Maybe there's a law.
There are no laws, Anshel, not for this.
Maybe if you took your nose
out of books once in a while,
you'd know more about life,
about men and women, about love.
How could I expect you to understand?
You've never felt it.
- Last call for Lublin province.
- Avigdor!
- Oh, my God.
- Can I carry your suitcase, sir?
Bye, Anshel. I'm sorry about everything.
Asking what I did was my only way
of staying, and it was wrong.
- No, it's not wrong.
- I think so.
It's understandable. You're in love.
- It was sinful, unnatural.
- Who knows what's natural?
- I was asking the impossible.
- Don't go, Avigdor.
Everything loaded. Everyone aboard.
Don't go!
I'll come with you!
Wait! Avigdor. Nothing's impossible!
Nothing.
- It's impossible.
- So, we're wrong?
What do you think, Zelig? I never had
such a hard time fitting anybody.
- The shoulders are...
- Never mind the shoulders.
- Look how tight it is around the chest.
- It fits. It fits.
- This is the way you cut, Zelig.
- Maybe it's the tape measure.
- Look, it's all right.
- All right?
For Alter Vishkower's son-in-law,
we have to do our best work.
- Well, it's my coat, and I like it this way.
- He likes it this way.
Look at him.
Look at me
I must be absolutely crazy
How did I ever let it get this far?
Take off the coat.
I'm getting deeper into trouble
Am I a woman or a man?
Am I a devil or a demon?
- We've got a problem with the pants.
- What's wrong with the pants?
Compared to the pants, even the
coat looks good. Take them off.
- Why?
- Why?
Papa was right
I ask too many questions
He said a soul can get perplexed
I can't believe what happens next
Papa was right
- Having trouble at the crotch.
- What's wrong with the crotch?
You'll find out when you go
"excuse me" to relieve yourself.
It seems this little game I play
becomes more risky every day
- The pants, please.
- All right, I'll take them off.
- But you'll have to leave the room first.
- He's ashamed in front of his tailor.
A tailor is like a doctor.
What's to be ashamed?
What do you think, Zelig?
Are you crazy?
The wedding's tomorrow night.
Move!
Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Under the canopy I'll stand
with her tomorrow night
And place a ring upon her hand
with her all dressed in white
Tomorrow night
I don't know how this came about
but I'll be wed without a doubt
Oh, my God. I got to get out
What did you say?
- I've got to get out of my clothes.
- Get back out here.
Look at this
Come on, move.
The way one lie begets another
Somebody wake me up
and say it's all a dream
Ouch!
Look at this.
Look how easily I fool them
They may have eyes, but they don't
see They never really look at me
People are blind
How else would everyone believe me?
It might be interesting to know
just how much further I can go
Well, are you blind, Zelig?
Look, the right sleeve
is longer than the left.
- This will never work.
- We'll make it work.
Well, at least the hat fits.
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
I can't believe what I'll presume to be
Tomorrow night
I'm not the bride,
but I'm the groom-to-be
Tomorrow night
And that's a monumental trick
I'd better think of something quick
Oh, my God, I'm feeling sick
It's just the usual nerves
before the wedding.
I think I'd better rest.
Rest, rest. You'll need all the
rest you can get. Right, Zelig?
I could run away
I could leave without a trace
Go anywhere or anyplace
Where no one knows my face
as a woman or a man
I don't know, just so I can run away
Run away
I'd be free, I'd be rid of all of this
But there's someone I would miss
And being near him is what this
Is all about
So running away is out
Do you think he'll get away with it?
I think we'll get away with it.
Papa, dear
You dreamed of dancing at my wedding
But something tells me that I'm right
You wouldn't want to dance tonight
Take off the clothes. All right, all right.
We'll leave the room first.
Come, Zelig, we have
a lot of work to do.
All with God's help, amen.
Isn't this
A strangely logical solution?
Things may not be as they appear
but the advantages are clear
He loves her, she loves him
He likes me, I like her
And I've reason to think she likes me
She keeps him, he keeps her
I keep things as they were
It's a perfect arrangement for three
Who'd have ever predicted
the moment would come
When I'd find myself grateful
they've kept women dumb?
She's an innocent maiden
but then so am I
That's why it's possible I could get by
Look, I've seen the
impossible happen before
Maybe, God willing,
it'll happen once more
For I feel like a train
on a perilous track
No way to stop, no way to go back
A snowball that's gathering
speed down a hill
Going faster and faster and faster until
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Even if someone would pray for me
Tomorrow night
There's not a prayer
that they could say for me
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Is now tonight
Blessings.
Success.
Musicians, please.
The mitzvah dance.
The handkerchief dance.
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going, Anshel?
Look, look there. Look at the shoulders.
You're not leaving, are you?
I have a wedding present for you,
for both of you.
- Thank you.
- Nachmonides, the holy letter.
He wrote it over 500 years ago.
"Converse with her to
put her mind at ease.
"Speak words which arouse her
to love, desire and passion,
"and words of reverence for God."
Never force her.
Her mood must be as yours.
Win her with graciousness
and seductiveness.
Be patient until her passion is aroused.
Begin with love.
And when her mood is ready,
let her desire be satisfied first.
Her delight is what matters.
Come along now.
- Avigdor, I don't know if I can... Avigdor.
- Anshel.
- Anshel.
- Your father-in-law's calling you.
Anshel, I have to talk to you.
Remember your obligation.
- Yes, Mother.
- Anshel, come, my son.
As I said, you mustn't be nervous.
See, Eve was made from Adam's rib
to obey his wishes,
his demands, and so must you.
- See, there's nothing to be nervous about.
- No, Mother. Yes, Mother.
We have protected her.
She knows nothing.
But you're the scholar.
So I don't have to tell you
to be fruitful and multiply.
Thank you, sir. I know the law.
May your wedding night
be as joyful as ours was.
And, please God,
a grandson nine months from now.
Esther, it's a wonderful wedding.
Are you too warm?
No.
- Shall I open a window?
- No.
Unless you want to. You're the man.
That's true.
- You don't have to be frightened, Hadass.
- I'm not.
You're not?
- Yes, I am.
- Good.
- What?
- I mean, it's only natural.
But you don't have to do anything
you don't want to, Hadass. Anything.
But I do. You're my husband, Anshel.
I have to do whatever you demand.
- No, that's not so.
- It's not?
No. According to the Talmud,
a woman has the right to refuse
her husband. You didn't know that?
- No. My mother said...
- Too many women don't know the law.
- So if you want to refuse...
- I didn't say...
Then, naturally, I respect your wishes.
You're a very considerate man, Anshel.
Only because I know you're
thinking of someone else.
Who? I'm not at all, of anyone.
- You mustn't be angry with him.
- What?
Well, any woman would be, wouldn't she?
I mean, who was close to him.
You're very understanding.
It's only natural that you wish he
were here instead of me. Don't you?
- But you're my husband...
- The thing is... The thing is, Hadass,
because you're still
thinking of Avigdor,
I can't let you commit
any unnecessary sin.
- Sin?
- Yes, it's very clearly written
that a woman cannot
give herself to one man
while she's still thinking of another.
- You didn't know that?
- No, I...
Because it's a terrible sin, believe me.
So, tonight, we'll do what you want,
which is nothing. I understand.
- I don't know what I want.
- Well, when you do,
you must let me know.
You're... You're very
hard to resist, Hadass,
but I'm not going to
force myself on you.
I'll... I'll just have to be patient.
- Good.
- Good.
A drop more wine?
- It's our secret. No one needs to know.
- Our secret.
And our friendship.
- A husband and wife can be friends?
- Oh, yes.
- Only one problem.
- What?
Help me.
In the morning, when they come in,
they'll think we've...
- But we haven't.
- Secret.
Wait, no, no, just one bed.
You silly goose.
You tell me.
Truce, truce.
Anshel.
I think I'm going to like
being married to you.
- Good night, Hadass.
- Good night.
So, what was it like?
- Oh, the usual. Music, dancing...
- I was there.
Hadass and I talked, laughed a little...
Laughed a lot.
And then she went to sleep.
Anshel, I'm a grown man.
You can tell me the truth.
Why is it people who want the truth
never believe it when they hear it?
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.
- Come on, tell me. Please.
- What do you think I did to her?
I don't know. You kissed her,
you caressed her, you held her.
- All right. All right. That, that.
- What? What?
I did everything just like you said.
What else do you want to know?
Did she make sounds? Did she scream?
She did a little screaming,
and then she went to sleep.
Went to sleep?
- Anshel.
- And she talked a little.
Talked? In her sleep? What did she say?
- Things like, "Avigdor, I love you."
- "I love you"?
Go on.
"I adore you, Avigdor," she said.
That's the truth?
Yes, my friend.
That's the truth.
Raspberry tea is very
good for headaches.
- Thank you.
- Am I disturbing you?
No.
It's almost sundown, the Sabbath.
Yes.
My mother says it's a special
blessing on the Sabbath.
- Going to synagogue?
- Going to bed.
- Unless you're tired.
- What?
Drink your tea. It's getting cold.
When Avigdor used to call,
I sometimes spilled things.
- I don't know if you ever noticed.
- No, never.
It's because he made me tremble inside.
That's love, Hadass.
But you don't make me tremble.
You make me peaceful.
Well, yes. That's the friendship
I was telling you about.
- You see, in the Talmud...
- So will you teach me?
Teach you?
Please?
- Talmud?
- Talmud?
- Talmud.
- Not the Talmud.
Talmud. Talmud.
Why not? Why not, Hadass?
It's the least a husband can do
for his wife, the most maybe.
I could never learn Talmud.
That's nonsense. If I can do it,
you can do it. Lock the door.
But isn't it a sin?
I thought women were forbidden...
Sin, sin, it's not a sin.
Then why are you closing the
curtains and me locking the door?
Why? Because I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.
Come, sit.
What's funny?
You. I've never seen you so excited.
Now, pay attention, Hadass.
First there's the Bible,
- the five books of Moses, which God...
- Wait a minute. I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?
- Anshel, I have the soup on the stove...
Let your mother do it, please.
The Talmud, on the other hand, is a series
of commentaries interpreting the...
- What are you doing?
- I was just pulling a thread...
- Well, don't. We're studying.
- Yes, Anshel.
Now, where was I?
A series of commentaries
interpreting the Bible.
Yes.
The first of these commentaries is
called the Mishnah, our code of law.
I'm glad your headache's better.
What is so incredible, Hadass,
is that it's a masterpiece of literature,
folklore and philosophy.
It deals with astronomy,
architecture, medicine,
everything from making love
to planting Egyptian beans.
Making love?
To planting Egyptian beans.
I thought you said something
about making love.
Then there's the Midrash, legends,
stories dealing with legal issues.
For example, two men are disputing
the ownership of a mule
or a flock of chickens,
let's say a flock of chickens...
Anshel, while your books
argue about chickens,
I've had to pluck them.
It's Friday. I've been up since dawn.
I'm too tired to be a
scholar on Fridays, Anshel.
I'm sorry.
I'm the one who's sorry, Hadass.
I'm too tired for the
special Sabbath blessing,
even if maybe you were
going to demand it.
Maybe.
Next Tuesday, 8:00.
What about her parents?
What about her parents? I'll just tell them,
"Avigdor's coming to dinner." That's that.
Anyway, they're away next Tuesday.
Are you two agreeing or disagreeing?
- Agreeing.
- Disagreeing.
- Disagreeing.
- Agreeing.
He's one second late.
Yes.
- Hello, Sophie.
- I'll take your hat.
Thank you, Sophie.
Hello.
Well, this is the one I
was telling you about,
the one I brought from home.
The first part's about the ancient mystics.
It's all a bit elementary, but...
Welcome, Avigdor.
- Tell me more.
- I've told you everything.
It was a very interesting discussion.
And then what happened?
Well, Avigdor was there, too.
He'll tell you.
And was Rabbi Zalman
angry or did he laugh?
He laughed. Didn't he, Avigdor?
- Yes.
- Did you laugh?
We both did.
I can just see you.
- I'll do that.
- No. That's all right.
- But you have a guest.
- So have you.
Marriage agrees with you.
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- Thank you.
Avigdor, I'm concerned about Anshel.
- What are you talking about?
- Do you think Anshel is happy?
Why don't we have tea in the parlor?
Milk or lemon?
Fine.
Sorry.
We left off with Maimonides'
code of the golden rule.
Let's read chapters seven and eight,
and then we can discuss them.
- Is that all right?
- All right.
Don't stop, Hadass. It's pretty.
Look at how he looks at her
Will someone ever look at me that way?
Full of all the feelings
And the soft unspoken words
that lovers say
I thought that I knew every single look
And sweet expression on his face
Yet this is one that I don't recognize
Although I've sat and
studied him for hours
But now I see how love
completely occupies
A pair of eyes
See the way they gaze at her
Like slaves they follow
everywhere she goes
Do my eyes forget themselves
And do I ever look at him
And smile in such a way
That what I'm feeling shows?
Sometimes I have the feeling
Everybody knows
And even though it's crazy
Still I can't help wondering if
I'll ever live to see that day
When by some
Miracle of miracles
He'll turn around and look at me
That way
It's no good. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Avigdor. Avigdor, wait!
Good night.
Anshel.
How many children do you want?
The actual number?
I don't think I've ever really...
He didn't make me tremble tonight.
You did, though.
- What's even nicer, I made you tremble.
- What?
When he was leaving,
I put my hand on yours.
You were trembling.
Well, what are you doing, Hadass?
- I want to look at you.
- Well, I can't read without my glasses.
When you told me
I had the right to refuse you,
you didn't tell me I also had
the right to demand you.
Who told you that?
The Talmud, the Yebamoth Tractate,
I forget what page.
Sixty-three A and B.
- It's written, Anshel.
- You've been studying too hard.
You told me to tell you
when I knew what I wanted.
I do.
And it isn't Avigdor,
so it's no longer a sin.
Hadass, I...
It's been terrible for you,
I know, all this waiting.
But it's all right now.
You don't have to wait any longer.
Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry, Hadass.
- For what?
For teaching me? For understanding me?
For making me fall in love with you?
No. I can't. I can't.
I feel so certain that you love me.
Everything you do shows me you love me.
What is it, Anshel?
Look at how she looks at me
I can never look at her that way
Is it me? Am I so...
- Do you find me...
- I find you beautiful, Hadass, beautiful.
Then what?
Full of all the feelings
And the soft unspoken
words that lovers say
There are so many things
I wish I could explain to you,
things I'd like to tell you.
I feel so...
- Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow?
- I hope so.
In all the words in all the books
I wish there were a way to say
What she's taught me
isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be
the one who's wise
One thing is certain
I can never be what she
Expects of me
I've wanted the shadows
I don't anymore
No matter what happens
I won't anymore
I've run from the sunlight
Afraid it saw too much
The moon had the one light
I bathed in
I walked in
I held in my feelings
And closed every door
No matter what happens
I can't anymore
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken
I need him to touch me
To know the love that's in my heart
The same heart that tells me
To see myself
To free myself
To be myself at last
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn
It's time they were opened
To welcome the dawn
A voice deep inside's getting stronger
I can't keep it quiet any longer
No matter what happens
It can't be the same anymore
I promise
It won't be
The same
Anymore
I'll miss you.
Oh, you'll have lots
to do while I'm gone.
- I know, but...
- Tell your parents I'm sorry.
Sorry?
That I wasn't here when they got home.
You'll see them on Friday.
You can tell us all about the big city.
Show them the books you bought.
I baked almond cakes.
You and Avigdor wouldn't last three days
without my almond cakes.
Thank you.
Hurry home.
It won't be the same here without you.
Hadass.
Do you remember
what we studied last week
in the Talmud about patience?
Tell me, what did we read?
- "Patience yields many good things."
- That's right.
And if you have patience,
you'll have everything you want.
Children, beautiful children,
as many as you want.
Trust me.
I do trust you.
Well, I have to be going.
I'll study while you're away.
I want you to be proud of me.
Oh, I am proud of you.
You should be proud of yourself.
I love you, Anshel.
I love you, too.
She's mother
She's sister
She's lover
She's the wonder of wonders
No man can deny
So why would he change her?
She's loving, she's tender
She's woman
So am I
This trip was a good
idea of yours, Anshel.
- I have a secret to tell you.
- Tell me.
- Not now.
- All right.
So my crazy plan was crazy after all.
What?
She loves you now.
- She only thinks she does.
- What?
Things aren't always what they seem.
What are you talking about?
You'll see.
Now, what's this secret of yours?
I'll tell you when we get to Lublin.
- Look, there's our friend again.
- I wonder if it ever gets tired.
- So, when are you going to tell me?
- Not yet.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
Slivovitz?
No, thanks.
So, let's hear this secret of yours.
- Maybe I will have a glass.
- Good. You look a little pale.
So, tell me.
Well...
We're friends. What can't you tell me?
All right.
Avigdor, what would you do
if all you ever wanted in life was
to study, and it was forbidden?
- It isn't forbidden. It isn't.
- But if it were?
What if there was some crazy law
that said all men called Avigdor
or all men with brown eyes were forbidden
to study? What would you do?
- I'd study anyway.
- Secretly?
If I had to. Why?
That would be difficult, wouldn't it?
Always hiding, afraid of being discovered.
Yes. What's your secret?
Without Talmud, without studying,
you couldn't live. Is that right?
- That's right. But you don't...
- I couldn't live without it, either.
- So?
- So I studied, secretly.
No, you didn't. What are you
babbling about, Anshel?
Avigdor, my name isn't Anshel.
That's your secret?
Dear Avigdor.
- I don't know how I'm gonna tell you this.
- Well, don't. I'll guess. Let's see.
I'm not a yeshiva boy.
That's it. You're the chief rabbi
of Lithuania. Am I warm?
- I'm not any kind of boy.
- Not the chief rabbi, all right. All right.
My name isn't Anshel.
- It's Yentl.
- Yentl?
And...
I'm a woman.
A woman?
A woman.
Now, my secret.
- I'm the czar of Russia.
- If you don't believe me, I'll prove it.
- Stop this, Anshel.
- I'm not Anshel. I'm Yentl.
I'm not a man. I'm a woman.
Stop it.
- I'm a woman, Avigdor.
- Anshel, I don't like this.
What kind of a game is this?
It's not a game. Not anymore.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
I've only shown you,
so you can testify to the rabbis.
- It can't be.
- It is.
What have you done?
- Avigdor, listen to me.
- Don't come near me.
- Please, just let me explain.
- Don't touch me.
Avigdor, don't be afraid of me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
- Look at you. You're a monster.
- No. No, I'm not.
- Sins, sins, sins upon sins.
- All I ever wanted to do in life was study,
and they wouldn't let me.
"A woman shall not wear
that which pertaineth to a man."
Avigdor, please, I had no choice!
- You're a devil.
- Just try to understand...
- Enough! Please!
- I'm not... I'm not... No, I'm not a devil.
Every commandment broken,
every second, every day, every night.
Stay away from me! Please!
- What are you, a demon?
- I'm not. You know...
- You spit on the Torah!
- I love the Torah!
You spit on it! You spit on everything
and everyone and nature itself!
In God's face, in my face,
in Hadass' face! God, Hadass.
- She knows nothing.
- "She knows nothing." Nothing?
No, she's never...
An innocent married to a devil!
You married a woman!
- How could you do such a thing?
- It was your idea!
- Mine? This? My doing?
- Yes.
Why? Come on, you're a man.
Come on. Why?
You're a man. Answer me like a man.
- I want to know why. Why? Why? Why?
- You wanted me to!
Why didn't you tell me you were a woman?
- I was afraid!
- Of what?
Of this, of exactly this!
So you lied to me! You lied to Hadass!
God, the things I told you,
things I wouldn't even tell a wife!
I'm glad you told me.
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a woman.
That's not good enough.
I want the answer.
Tell me the answer. Why? Why?
- Why? Why?
- I was afraid!
- I wanted to be near you!
- Why?
- I didn't want to lose you!
- Why?
I loved you.
I loved you.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
I loved you.
I thought you didn't
understand about love.
No wonder.
My God, no wonder.
All the times I looked at you,
and I touched you,
and I couldn't understand why.
I thought there was
something wrong with me.
There was nothing wrong with you.
It was me.
Your skin.
It's so...
Your hair.
It must have been beautiful.
It'll grow.
Your hands.
I always tried to hide them.
Oh, no.
I did... I...
I didn't want to touch you.
I was afraid to.
Your mouth.
Yentl.
I loved you, too.
Hadass.
It's not difficult.
I'll write a statement to the rabbis
that the marriage was never consummated.
And you can take it back to
Bechev and give it to the rabbis.
The rabbis witnessed it.
Witnessed what, a marriage between
two women? It's null and void.
Nevertheless, according to
divorce procedures...
No, you're wrong, Avigdor.
According to God, it was not a marriage.
This is crazy.
I'm arguing Talmud with a woman.
It's not the first time.
Go back to her, Avigdor.
I don't think Hadass will listen
to her parents anymore.
Maybe there's something else we can do.
There must be a law or something,
a tractate...
Avigdor, there's no
book with this in it.
Sometimes right can come from wrong,
virtue from sin.
It's in the Talmud somewhere.
We'll go to another town
where no one knows us.
We'll get married. We'll make a home.
We'll have children.
- We'll... I'll find a new yeshiva.
- For both of us?
You still want to study?
Avigdor, we've argued the Bible
straight back to Genesis,
chapter one, verse one.
- How could you still ask me that question?
- You don't need to anymore.
I'll do the thinking.
I'll take care of everything.
No, I want to study with you,
not darn your socks!
- You're asking the impossible.
- Nothing's impossible!
All right. All right. You can study at night
when I come home. No one has to know.
What are we gonna do,
draw the curtains, close the shutters?
Don't you understand?
I want you to be a real woman.
- I am a real woman.
- Then act like one!
There's no gift from God that is
more beautiful and more miraculous.
You know everything without
opening a single book.
What more do you want?
More.
Your beard.
I suppose it'll never grow in now.
How could I have been so blind?
Here's a statement for the
rabbi and a note for Hadass.
Would you give it to her for me, please?
I will miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Avigdor.
Goodbye, Anshel.
Yentl.
Yentl.
There are moments
you remember all your life
There are moments you know
will be with you all your life
His face will be written on my mind
Will be written in my heart
As long as I live
My dear Avigdor.
After many months,
your letter finally reached me.
I hope this one finds you.
Since we said goodbye, I've prayed
that despite all the pain I've caused,
some happiness would come out of it.
And now you tell me it has.
As for me, I'm going to a new place
where I hear things are different.
Anyway, we'll see.
Take care of yourself and Hadass.
I hope she continues with her studies.
She has great promise.
And remember,
I will love you both, always.
Tell me where
Where is it written
what it is I'm meant to be?
That I can't dare?
It all began
The day I found
That from my window
I could only see a piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come
Papa, can you hear me?
To try my wings
Papa, are you near me?
And even though it seemed
at any moment I could fall
I felt the most
Papa, can you see me?
Amazing things
Can you understand me?
The things you can't imagine
if you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies there
the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories
that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be more to
question yet more to believe
Oh, tell me where
Where is the someone who
will turn to look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet imagined possibility?
The more I live, the more I learn
The more I learn, the more
I realize the less I know
Each step I take
Papa, I've a voice now
Each page I turn
Papa, I've a choice now
Each mile I travel only means
the more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly, then soar
With all there is
Why settle for
Just a piece of sky?
Papa, I can hear you
Papa, I can see you
Papa, I can feel you
Papa, watch me fly
