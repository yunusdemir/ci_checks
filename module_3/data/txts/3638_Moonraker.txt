<i>How we doing, Richard?</i>
<i>We should pass over the English
coast 15 minutes ahead of time, sir.</i>
<i>Well, with this load
on our back, that's good going.</i>
<i>Just trust the RAF, sir.</i>
<i>-What the hell is that?
-The shuttle ignition.</i>
<i>Disappeared?
And what happened to the Moonraker?</i>
<i>Good God.</i>
<i>Yes, yes, of course, Minister. Right away.</i>
<i>Moneypenny, is 007 back
from that African job?</i>
<i>He's on his last leg, sir.</i>
<i>Any higher, Mr. Bond, my ears will pop.</i>
<i>I don't think I'm ever going
to fly with anyone else.</i>
<i>You're so right, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>This is where we leave you, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>A little premature, isn't it?</i>
<i>Enjoy your flight.</i>
<i>-Good morning, Moneypenny.
-James.</i>
<i>But why are you so late?</i>
<i>I fell out of an airplane
without a parachute.</i>
<i>-Who's in there?
-Q and the Minister of Defense.</i>
<i>You don't believe me, do you?</i>
<i>-And you should go right in.
-Yes, Moneypenny.</i>
<i>-007. At last.
-Good morning, sir.</i>
<i>I think you know Frederick Gray,
Minister of Defense.</i>
<i>-Commander.
-Minister. Q.</i>
<i>007.</i>
<i>Moonraker?</i>
<i>-What do you know about Moonraker?
-What I read in the newspaper, sir.</i>
<i>Then you'll know that Moonraker,
the space shuttle,</i>
<i>was being flown over here</i>
<i>on loan from the Americans
on the back of a 747.</i>
<i>Yes, which crashed
somewhere in the Yukon,</i>
<i>aircraft and shuttle
totally destroyed, correct?</i>
<i>-That's the official version.
-The truth is rather more disturbing, 007.</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>Now, that's the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn over a large area.</i>
<i>That's all that's left of the fuselage.</i>
<i>We've been through it
with a fine-toothed comb,</i>
<i>but there's no sign of Moonraker,
not a trace.</i>
<i>Are you suggesting the shuttle
was hijacked in midair?</i>
<i>That's for you to find out, 007.</i>
<i>The shuttles are built in California
by Drax Industries.</i>
<i>Yes. We were responsible
for the safety of that shuttle, Commander.</i>
<i>The United States government
is justifiably concerned.</i>
<i>I can imagine.
Then, California must be the place to start.</i>
<i>-I agree.
-Don't make any mistakes, 007.</i>
<i>The situation is critical.
We've got to find that shuttle.</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>If that's all, gentlemen...</i>
<i>Just a minute, 007.
I've got something for you.</i>
<i>Roll up your right sleeve, will you?</i>
<i>This is now being issued
as standard equipment.</i>
<i>Strap it on your wrist.</i>
<i>It's activated by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.</i>
<i>Like this?</i>
<i>Oh, thank you, 007.</i>
<i>-Be careful, will you?
-Yes, Q.</i>
<i>Ten darts, five blue-tipped
with armor piercing heads,</i>
<i>five red-tipped, cyanide coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.</i>
<i>Very novel, Q. You must get them
in the stores for Christmas.</i>
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>
<i>-Welcome to California, Mr. Bond.
-I like it already.</i>
<i>My name is Corinne Dufour.</i>
<i>Oh, and you're going to be showing
me around, are you, Corinne?</i>
<i>No. I'm just a humble pilot
in the service of the Drax Corporation.</i>
<i>This is the Drax estate now.
Everything you see belongs to Mr. Drax.</i>
<i>-Owns a lot, doesn't he?
-What he doesn't own, he doesn't want.</i>
<i>We're approaching
the main complex now.</i>
<i>That's where
the Moonraker shuttle is made?</i>
<i>That's right, workshops, hangars,</i>
<i>design and experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.</i>
<i>Very impressive.</i>
<i>I'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.</i>
<i>Now, I can believe it. Good Lord.</i>
<i>The Drax residence.
Every stone brought from France.</i>
<i>-Cute, isn't it?
-Magnificent.</i>
<i>Why didn't he buy
the Eiffel Tower as well?</i>
<i>He did, but the French government
refused him an export permit.</i>
<i>Look there.
Those are the astronaut trainees.</i>
<i>Mr. Drax is financing the entire
training program out of his own pocket.</i>
<i>He seems to have an eye
for a good investment.</i>
<i>Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond
in the drawing room, Miss Dufour.</i>
<i>-Thank you, Cavendish.
-This way, please, sir.</i>
<i>Mr. Bond, sir.</i>
<i>-Mr. Bond.
-Mr. Drax.</i>
<i>Allow me to present, before they leave
us, Countess Lubinski,</i>
<i>Lady Victoria Devon, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>How do you do?</i>
<i>Well, my dear fellow,
your reputation precedes you, of course.</i>
<i>I'm honored that your government should
send you on so delicate a mission.</i>
<i>Delicate, Mr. Drax?</i>
<i>Well, to apologize in person
for the loss of my space shuttle.</i>
<i>How would Oscar Wilde have put it?</i>
<i>"To lose one aircraft may be regarded
as a misfortune,</i>
<i>"to lose two seems like carelessness."</i>
<i>Well, an apology will be made
to the American government, Mr. Drax,</i>
<i>when we've discovered why there was no
trace of the Moonraker in that wreckage.</i>
<i>And your loyalty
commands respect, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>You have arrived at a propitious moment,</i>
<i>coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution</i>
<i>to Western civilization.</i>
<i>Afternoon tea.</i>
<i>-May I press you to a cucumber sandwich?
-Thank you, no, nothing at all.</i>
<i>The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?</i>
<i>No. I own a number of subsidiaries
throughout the world,</i>
<i>producing components.</i>
<i>The conquest of space represents
an investment in the future</i>
<i>of the entire human race, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>It is, therefore, logical to seek out
the best that each nation has to offer.</i>
<i>-Are you referring to people or skills?
-Both, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>-Am I too soon?
-Not at all.</i>
<i>I'm sure Mr. Bond
is eager to start his tour.</i>
<i>Miss Dufour will escort you to
Dr. Goodhead who will show you around.</i>
<i>Ask anything you like.</i>
<i>-Thank you for being so cooperative.
-A pleasure.</i>
<i>Look after Mr. Bond.
See that some harm comes to him.</i>
<i>You'll find Dr. Goodhead first on the right.</i>
<i>-Oh. Thank you for the ride.
-Call on me if you need anything.</i>
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>-Can I help you?
-Yes. My name is Bond.</i>
<i>James Bond.
I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.</i>
<i>-You just found her.
-A woman.</i>
<i>Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>James, to my friends.</i>
<i>Holly Goodhead.</i>
<i>-Are you training to be an astronaut?
-I'm fully trained.</i>
<i>On loan from NASA,
the Space Administration.</i>
<i>Well, Mr. Bond,
I guess we'd better get started.</i>
<i>You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle, do you?</i>
<i>This is it, the Moonraker.</i>
<i>Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...</i>
<i>Orbiting the Earth and reentering
the atmosphere to land</i>
<i>like any conventional aircraft.</i>
<i>This is the centrifuge training.</i>
<i>It simulates the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.</i>
<i>The speed is controlled
by the instructor from up there.</i>
<i>Why not try it?</i>
<i>Why not?</i>
<i>-Strap yourself in firmly.
-Yes, Doctor.</i>
<i>Now your arms.</i>
<i>That's to prevent you
from knocking yourself out.</i>
<i>I see.</i>
<i>How fast does it go?</i>
<i>It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.</i>
<i>Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.</i>
<i>Most people pass out at seven.</i>
<i>You make a great saleswoman.</i>
<i>You don't have to worry.
This is what we call a "Chicken Switch."</i>
<i>You just keep your finger on that button,</i>
<i>the moment the pressure gets
too much for you, release the button</i>
<i>-and the power's cut off.
-Just like that?</i>
<i>Come on, Mr. Bond.
A 70-year-old can take 3 Gs.</i>
<i>Well, the trouble is there is never
a 70-year-old around when you need one.</i>
<i>-You want me?
-Mr. Drax says to telephone him.</i>
<i>All right, I'll call him from my office.
You go ahead. I'll be right back.</i>
<i>The instructor will supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.</i>
<i>Yes. We're taking good care of him.</i>
<i>I don't know what could've happened.</i>
<i>Something must've gone wrong
with the controls.</i>
<i>Let me help you.</i>
<i>My mother gave me a list of things
not to do on a first date.</i>
<i>Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.</i>
<i>No. What do you want then?</i>
<i>Would your feelings be shattered
if I were to say information?</i>
<i>-Why should I tell you anything?
-Why, indeed?</i>
<i>You presume a great deal, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>What goes on here
besides the manufacture of Moonraker?</i>
<i>And the astronaut training program?</i>
<i>There are other laboratories,
but not much is happening now.</i>
<i>No?</i>
<i>They were working on something very
secret, but everything's been moved.</i>
<i>Where to?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>What about that list of your mother's?</i>
<i>I never learned to read.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>You whetted my appetite for information.</i>
<i>Is there a safe in here? Thank you.</i>
<i>James, no.</i>
<i>That's amazing.</i>
<i>There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.</i>
<i>Eighteen karat.</i>
<i>You must go.</i>
<i>Well, you go first. I'll turn off the lights.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>-Take care of yourself.
-And you.</i>
<i>Ah, my dear Bond.</i>
<i>This is Mademoiselle Deladier
and La Signorina del Mateo.</i>
<i>-Ladies.
-I'll see you at lunch.</i>
<i>A pity you leave us. Such good sport.</i>
<i>Unless you're a pheasant.</i>
<i>Really, Mr. Bond. Take my gun,
a stray bird may fly over.</i>
<i>I only stopped to thank you
for your hospitality.</i>
<i>Fraser will get you
to the airport in plenty of time.</i>
<i>Come now.</i>
<i>-I doubt if I'm in your class.
-Oh, you're too modest, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>Over there.</i>
<i>You missed, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>Did I?</i>
<i>As you said, such good sport.</i>
<i>You called for me, Mr. Drax.</i>
<i>You were with Bond last night
in my study.</i>
<i>No, I...</i>
<i>-You showed him the safe.
-I didn't.</i>
<i>I'm terminating your employment.
You will leave immediately.</i>
<i>Franco, I'll call you
to tell you where to meet me.</i>
<i>Could I interest you in something?</i>
<i>Why, I'm tempted to say yes immediately.</i>
<i>But I think maybe
I'd better have a look around.</i>
<i>Please. Go anywhere you wish.</i>
<i>And in 1955,
the Venini Museum and Glass Works</i>
<i>was taken over by Drax Industries.</i>
<i>And here, ladies and gentlemen,
we have some of the rarest examples</i>
<i>of the glassblower's art.</i>
<i>As you know, everything was done
absolutely by hand.</i>
<i>Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati,</i>
<i>sometime between 1850 and 1860.
If you'd like to follow me over here.</i>
<i>This exquisite bowl was fashioned
about 1520, over 450 years ago.</i>
<i>If it ever came on the market,
it would certainly fetch a price</i>
<i>in excess of one million American dollars.</i>
<i>But if any of you are thinking
of taking it...</i>
<i>Now, we have here
a very early 17th century dish</i>
<i>with an aquamarine medallion.</i>
<i>Over here, we have
something very, very interesting.</i>
<i>This glass-handled sword,</i>
<i>the only one of its kind in the world,</i>
<i>was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century</i>
<i>and is the work of Bruno...</i>
<i>14th century.</i>
<i>Dr. Goodhead.</i>
<i>I can only hope your presence here
is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>-I dislike being spied on.
-Well, don't we all?</i>
<i>You're staying at the Danieli, aren't you?</i>
<i>-Yes. How did you know?
-Well, I like to keep abreast of things.</i>
<i>May I ask what you're doing in Venice?</i>
<i>I'm addressing a seminar
of the European Space Commission.</i>
<i>My, heavy stuff.</i>
<i>But there again,
I keep forgetting that you are</i>
<i>more than just a very beautiful woman.</i>
<i>If you're trying to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.</i>
<i>I have more important things
on my mind.</i>
<i>Ah, that's what I'd like
to talk to you about.</i>
<i>-Dinner this evening?
-This evening I'm giving my address.</i>
<i>Well, then, can you think of reason
why we don't have a drink afterwards?</i>
<i>Not immediately. But I'm sure I shall.</i>
<i>Franco.</i>
<i>Play it again, Sam.</i>
<i>-What the hell are you doing here?
-Convalescing.</i>
<i>Your friend Cha just tried to kill me.</i>
<i>And you think I had something
to do with it?</i>
<i>Well, the thought
had flashed across my mind.</i>
<i>-What's Drax up to in that laboratory?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?</i>
<i>-You leaving me your telephone number?
-I don't see the point.</i>
<i>Ah, now I do.</i>
<i>Not what I want to get stuck with tonight.</i>
<i>James, why don't you
pour yourself a drink?</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Daily diary.</i>
<i>Fairly deadly diary.</i>
<i>Bollinger.
If it's '69, you were expecting me.</i>
<i>Trifle overpowering, your scent.</i>
<i>Standard CIA equipment.</i>
<i>And the CIA
placed you with Drax, correct?</i>
<i>-Very astute of you, James.
-Oh, not really.</i>
<i>I have friends in low places.</i>
<i>Could this possibly be the moment
for us to pool our resources?</i>
<i>It could have its compensations.</i>
<i>Where are you
planning on going from here?</i>
<i>I'm not planning on going anywhere.</i>
<i>Oh, I suppose you're right, Holly.
We would be better off working together.</i>
<i>-Detente?
-Agreed.</i>
<i>-Understanding?
-Possibly.</i>
<i>-Cooperation?
-Maybe.</i>
<i>-Trust?
-Out of the question.</i>
<i>Send the night porter up
for my bags immediately, please.</i>
<i>I hope you know what you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge with this fellow Drax.</i>
<i>007 doesn't usually push the panic
button unless it's something serious.</i>
<i>-I should hope not.
-Good morning, Inspector.</i>
<i>-Good morning.
-I see you've covered everything</i>
<i>-with our Italian friends.
-Yes, sir.</i>
<i>-Is this it?
-Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Gas masks?</i>
<i>We can't afford to take
any chances, Minister.</i>
<i>Frederick Gray. What a surprise.</i>
<i>And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks.</i>
<i>You must excuse me, gentlemen,
not being English,</i>
<i>I sometimes find your sense of humor
rather difficult to follow.</i>
<i>On behalf of the British government,
I apologize.</i>
<i>I think you owe us an explanation, 007.</i>
<i>I've never been so humiliated in my life.</i>
<i>Your man
should be taken off the assignment.</i>
<i>I'll see you at the consulate.</i>
<i>I'll have to do what he says.</i>
<i>Well, before you do that, sir,
have Q do an analysis of this.</i>
<i>I took it from the laboratory.</i>
<i>Tell him to exercise extreme caution.
It is lethal.</i>
<i>So, there was a laboratory.</i>
<i>You better take two weeks
leave of absence, 007.</i>
<i>Do have any thoughts
about where you might go?</i>
<i>I've always had a hankering
to go to Rio, sir.</i>
<i>I think I can recall your mentioning it.</i>
<i>007, no slipups or we're both in trouble.</i>
<i>Yes, a minor crisis has been averted.</i>
<i>No, no, nothing serious,
but all merchandise</i>
<i>is to be rerouted as from today.</i>
<i>Now, regarding a replacement for Cha,</i>
<i>do you have someone in mind?</i>
<i>Oh, yes, well,
if you can get him, of course.</i>
<i>Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro
now boarding, gate number seven.</i>
<i>Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>-The President Suite.
-Really?</i>
<i>Well, don't bother showing me the rest.
If I get lost, I'll take a cab.</i>
<i>-Do you come with the suite?
-It depends who's renting it.</i>
<i>Vodka martini? Shaken not stirred.</i>
<i>Why were you
following me from the airport?</i>
<i>I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.</i>
<i>I work for Station VH.
We have been asked to assist you.</i>
<i>M thinks of everything.</i>
<i>Tell me, Manuela, do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?</i>
<i>C and W? Yes, Carlos and Wilmsberg.</i>
<i>They are very big importers in Rio.</i>
<i>A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe.</i>
<i>They have a warehouse
on Carioca Avenue.</i>
<i>I'd like to pay it a discreet visit tonight.</i>
<i>Tonight? I think you may find that
a little difficult.</i>
<i>Difficult or not,
it's something we have to do.</i>
<i>And meanwhile,</i>
<i>how do you kill five hours in Rio
if you don't samba?</i>
<i>-There's the warehouse.
-And not a soul about.</i>
<i>-I think there's a way around the back.
-Good thinking.</i>
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>Don't talk to any strange men. I'll be back.</i>
<i>-Are you all right?
-Yes, but I'd rather dance with you.</i>
<i>I did tell you
not to talk to any strange men.</i>
<i>-Did you find anything in there?
-Only this.</i>
<i>"Drax Air Freight."</i>
<i>Do you know which airport
they operate from?</i>
<i>Yes. San Pietro.
Do you want me to take you there?</i>
<i>No, I think you need some rest.</i>
<i>-Come on. I'll drop you off.
-Okay.</i>
<i>-Haven't we met before somewhere?
-The face is familiar, as is the manner.</i>
<i>It's become distinctly chilly since Venice.</i>
<i>Well, that was
before you walked out on me.</i>
<i>Yes, nearly tripping over your suitcase
on the way through the door.</i>
<i>So?</i>
<i>So why waste time
working against each other?</i>
<i>I've checked Drax's warehouse in town.
It's empty.</i>
<i>That's no surprise. Since I've been here,</i>
<i>those planes have been
taking off every two hours.</i>
<i>-Yes. He's moving out.
-Where to?</i>
<i>That's what we're going to find out,</i>
<i>now that we're working together.</i>
<i>-I still don't know if I trust you.
-I don't know if I trust you either.</i>
<i>That's what makes it
more exciting, doesn't it?</i>
<i>-What's wrong?
-I don't know.</i>
<i>But I'm sure we're better off out than in.</i>
<i>Bring that chain.</i>
<i>-Hang on, James.
-The thought had occurred to me.</i>
<i>I might have guessed.</i>
<i>-Do you know him?
-Not socially.</i>
<i>His name's Jaws. He kills people.</i>
<i>Here, give me the chain.</i>
<i>Come on. Hang on to me.</i>
<i>Jump.</i>
<i>-Have you broken something?
-Only my tailor's heart.</i>
<i>-What was that for?
-For saving my life.</i>
<i>Remind me to do it more often.</i>
<i>Oh, thank you, but we're in great shape.</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>
<i>James! You look as though
you've just fallen off a mountain.</i>
<i>Well, it's funny
you should say that, Moneypenny.</i>
<i>As a matter of fact,
I was in a cable car and...</i>
<i>-Never mind.
-The other courtyard.</i>
<i>-Ah, there you are, 007.
-Balls, Q?</i>
<i>Bolas, 007.</i>
<i>-Good. Have that ready for Army Day.
-Yes, sir.</i>
<i>-Where's M?
-He's in the office over there.</i>
<i>This way.</i>
<i>-Good morning, 007.
-Good morning, sir.</i>
<i>-You're just in time. Sit down.
-Thank you, sir.</i>
<i>-Q's come up with something.
-Splendid.</i>
<i>-Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
-Afraid not. Right, Q.</i>
<i>Well, it's a breakdown on that phial
of liquid you picked up in Venice.</i>
<i>-You know, you seem to be right, 007.
-Thank you.</i>
<i>It's a highly toxic nerve gas that
appears to have no effect on animals.</i>
<i>May I see the formula?</i>
<i>It's a chemical formula of a plant.</i>
<i>Orchideae anegra.
A very rare orchid indeed.</i>
<i>Yes. It was thought to be extinct.</i>
<i>Until a missionary brought one back
from the upper reaches of the Amazoco.</i>
<i>Well, actually he brought it back
from the area of the River Tapirape.</i>
<i>Well done, James.
You better get up there and fast.</i>
<i>And I've got something to get him there,
if 007 can be trusted to look after it.</i>
<i>Mr. Bond, you defy all my attempts
to plan an amusing death for you.</i>
<i>You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>Why did you break off
the encounter with my pet python?</i>
<i>I discovered he had a crush on me.</i>

<i>What exactly are you up to here, Drax?</i>
<i>-And why the orchids?
-The curse of a civilization.</i>
<i>It was neither war nor pestilence
that wiped out the race</i>
<i>who built the great city lying around us.</i>
<i>It was their reverence
for this lovely flower.</i>
<i>Because long-term exposure
to its pollen caused sterility.</i>
<i>Correct, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>As you discovered,
I have improved upon sterility.</i>
<i>Those same seeds now yield death.</i>
<i>Not, of course, to animals or plant life.
One must preserve the balance of nature.</i>

<i>We're all on parallel courses.</i>
<i>So, we must be headed

<i>Noah's Ark. This operation.</i>
<i>We're converging.</i>
<i>-Control rockets?
-Yes, we're slowing down.</i>
<i>What's that?</i>
<i>There's no image on the radar scanner.</i>
<i>An entire city in space

<i>-So nobody on Earth knows it's there.
-Right.</i>
<i>Drax must have a radar-jamming system.</i>

<i>Those are the globes I saw in Venice
with the nerve gas phials inside.</i>
<i>First there was a dream.
Now there is reality.</i>
<i>Here in the untainted
cradle of the heavens</i>
<i>will be created a new super-race,</i>
<i>a race of perfect physical specimens.</i>
<i>You have been selected
as its progenitors, like gods.</i>
<i>Your offspring will return to Earth
and shape it in their image.</i>
<i>You have all served in humble capacities
in my terrestrial empire.</i>
<i>Your seed, like yourselves,</i>
<i>will pay deference to the ultimate
dynasty which I alone have created.</i>
<i>From their first day on Earth
they will be able to look up</i>
<i>and know that there is
law and order in the heavens.</i>
<i>All units, start Operation Orchid.</i>
<i>If we were visible from Earth,
they'd investigate.</i>
<i>Where do you suppose
that radar-jamming system is?</i>
<i>We didn't pass anything on the way here,
so let's try this way.</i>
<i>Station two, check coordinates,
mode four.</i>
<i>Initiate globe launch timing sequence.</i>
<i>Orbital communicator, level 10.
Zero gravity.</i>
<i>This is it, the radar-jamming system.</i>
<i>-Coordinate conversion program.
-Check.</i>
<i>-Side lobe gain.
-Check.</i>
<i>-Spectral response.
-Check.</i>
<i>-Spin stabilizer correction factor.
-Okay.</i>
<i>Gigahertz reflector efficiency.</i>
<i>Solar photon screen.</i>
<i>Where did you learn to fight like that?
NASA?</i>
<i>No, Vassar.</i>
<i>-Switched off?
-Permanently.</i>
<i>Now we can be spotted from Earth.</i>
<i>-This doesn't look good at all.
-It's over 200 meters in diameter.</i>
<i>Yes, yes.</i>
<i>Will you please listen, General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.</i>
<i>Neither did we, Colonel Scott.
So what are you suggesting?</i>
<i>We've taken action already.
We're sending up a vehicle to intercept.</i>
<i>Very well, but if we don't hear from you
in the next 12 hours</i>
<i>we take action ourselves and hold you
responsible for the consequences.</i>
<i>We'll be in touch, General.</i>
<i>-Sorry to have woken you.
-I was already awake.</i>
<i>How can I sleep? Nothing but problems.</i>
<i>Problems, problems.</i>
<i>Marine astronauts to launch pad.</i>
<i>-Launch pre-program complete, sir.
-Launch globe number one.</i>
<i>T.D.R.S.S. reports a launch, sir.
Continental U.S.A. Vandenberg.</i>
<i>There are no launches scheduled.
Check radar-jamming system.</i>
<i>Well?</i>
<i>Jamming power supply
and backup have failed, sir.</i>
<i>-Investigate immediately.
-Investigate number 28, immediately.</i>
<i>James Bond.</i>
<i>You appear with the tedious
inevitability of an unloved season.</i>
<i>I didn't think
there were any seasons in space.</i>
<i>As far as you're concerned, only winter.</i>
<i>And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead.</i>
<i>Despite your efforts, my finely
wrought dream approaches its fulfillment.</i>
<i>Your dream, whatever sort of nightmare
it is, hasn't a chance, Drax.</i>
<i>You think not? We shall see.</i>
<i>We're coming up to
second launch position.</i>
<i>Launch globe number two.</i>
<i>No doubt you have realized
the splendor of my conception.</i>
<i>First, a necklace of death about the Earth.</i>
<i>50 globes, each releasing its nerve gas
over a designated area,</i>
<i>each capable of killing 100 million people.</i>
<i>And the human race as you know it
will cease to exist.</i>
<i>Then a rebirth, a new world.</i>
<i>U.S. spacecraft on course
to intercept us, sir.</i>
<i>Activate laser.
Prepare to destroy spacecraft.</i>
<i>You see, my dear Bond, we're well able
to protect ourselves against all enemies.</i>
<i>Allow me to introduce you
to the airlock chamber.</i>
<i>Observe, Mr. Bond, your route
from this world to the next.</i>
<i>And you, Dr. Goodhead.</i>
<i>Your desire to be
America's first woman in space</i>
<i>will shortly be fulfilled.</i>
<i>Leaving you on your flying stud farm,
conceiving your new master race?</i>
<i>If you like, yes.</i>
<i>And of course, anyone not measuring up
to your standards of physical perfection</i>
<i>-will be exterminated.
-Certainly.</i>
<i>Interesting.</i>
<i>Most interesting.</i>
<i>Jaws, expel them.</i>
<i>Jaws! You obey me!</i>
<i>Expel them!</i>
<i>Hold them!</i>
<i>Sir, U.S. spacecraft,
three minutes to intercept.</i>
<i>Stand by to laser it.</i>
<i>-Initiate firing sequence.
-Initiating.</i>
<i>U.S. spacecraft in laser range,
25.5 and closing.</i>
<i>Range 15.</i>
<i>Range 10.</i>
<i>Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two...</i>
<i>It's stopped rotating.</i>
<i>Open the cargo doors.</i>
<i>Number one platoon, EVA.</i>
<i>Number one platoon, EVA.</i>
<i>Let's try docking.</i>
<i>Colonel Scott will take the first landing!</i>
<i>Intruders have docked
at satellite seven, sir.</i>
<i>Double the guard at every entrance
in this satellite.</i>
<i>Report intruders' progress
throughout the space station.</i>
<i>Number three globe
ready for launching, sir.</i>
<i>Proceed!</i>
<i>Group One, attack enemy.
All units shoot to kill.</i>
<i>-Colonel Scott, don't shoot.
-Hold your fire.</i>
<i>Corridor five penetrated. Intruders
advancing on Command satellite.</i>
<i>Maintenance crew needed, section three.</i>
<i>At least I shall have the pleasure
of putting you out of my misery.</i>
<i>Desolated, Mr. Bond?</i>
<i>Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.</i>
<i>Allow me.</i>
<i>Take a giant step for mankind.</i>
<i>-Where's Drax?
-He had to fly.</i>
<i>How's Scott doing?</i>
<i>He's got control
of the Command satellite.</i>
<i>We put the launching gear
for the globes out of action.</i>
<i>When the station breaks up,
they'll disintegrate. They'll harm no one.</i>
<i>But the three that have gone,
they'll kill millions.</i>
<i>Those three must be destroyed.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Colonel, get your men off
as quickly as possible.</i>
<i>Your mission is completed.</i>
<i>Sergeant, round up your men,
get them back to the shuttle. Fast!</i>
<i>Back to the shuttle, everybody!
On the double!</i>
<i>Moonraker Five, that's the answer.
Drax's shuttle is armed with a laser.</i>
<i>We can track those globes
and destroy them.</i>
<i>It's hopeless, sir. The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.</i>
<i>All right, let's go.</i>
<i>Docking release system is jammed.</i>
<i>Release the door lock.
I'll see if I can operate it manually.</i>
<i>It's jammed too.</i>
<i>Well, here's to us.</i>
<i>Jaws, we can't disengage.
The docking release system is jammed.</i>
<i>Can you help us?</i>
<i>We're free.</i>
<i>Don't worry, they'll make it.
It's only 100 miles to Earth.</i>
<i>Let's get a read-out on those globes.</i>
<i>I have the three globes on the screen.
We should have a visual in a minute.</i>
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>The laser's on automatic. Code 945 set.</i>
<i>One down, two to go.</i>
<i>Number two straight ahead.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>We're skipping on the Earth's atmosphere.</i>
<i>In range.</i>
<i>-We should see the last one soon.
-There it is.</i>
<i>-It's getting hot.
-It can't be helped.</i>
<i>I'm coming in at a steeper angle than I
should in order to catch that last globe.</i>
<i>I can't hold this course much longer.
We'll break up at 200,000 feet.</i>
<i>Just a few seconds more.</i>
<i>Automatic firing system negative.
Must be the heat. Switching to manual.</i>
<i>Controls aren't responding.</i>
<i>-The wings are beginning to glow.
-Just hold her steady.</i>
<i>Steady.</i>
<i>It's entering Earth's atmosphere!
James, this is our last chance.</i>
<i>Steady.</i>
<i>Colonel Scott reports picking up
two survivors from the space station,</i>
<i>a tall man and a short blonde woman.</i>
<i>Right. Okay.</i>
<i>Dr. Goodhead reported their position
20 minutes ago.</i>
<i>They're just coming into range
of our tracking ship in the Pacific Ocean.</i>
<i>We should have audiovisual
within a few minutes</i>
<i>from the remote onboard TV monitors.</i>
<i>Houston calling Dr. Goodhead.
Houston calling. Confirm your position.</i>
<i>As this is the first joint venture
between our two countries,</i>
<i>I'm having it patched directly to
the White House and Buckingham Palace.</i>
<i>Well, I'm sure Her Majesty
will be fascinated.</i>
<i>-We have audiovisual.
-Ah, at last.</i>
<i>-007.
-My God, what's Bond doing?</i>
<i>I think he's attempting re-entry, sir.</i>
<i>-James?
-I think it may be time to go home.</i>
<i>Take me round the world one more time.</i>
<i>Why not?</i>
