Nice stems.
Thanks.
[Mr. Hall]
Cher?
Present.
We established that during attendance.
It's time for your oral.
Excuse me?
Your original oral.
Violence in the media.
Oh!
So, O.K.
The attorney general says
there's too much violence on TV,
and that should stop.
Even if you took out
all the violent shows,
you could still see the news.
So until mankind
is peaceful enough
not to have violence on the news,
there's no point
in taking it out of shows
that need it for entertainment value.
Thank you.
[Cheering]
Any comments? Elton?
My foot hurts.
Can I go to the nurse?
Travis?
Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.
Fine holiday fun.
Hello? Was I the only one listening?
I mean, I thought it reeked.
I believe that was
your designer impostor perfume.
[Bell Rings]
I dug it.

During the next few days,
I did what any normal girl would do.
I sent myself love letters
and flowers and candy,
just so he'd see how desired I was
in case he didn't already know.
# He got the finest face I ever seen#
# And the body to go with it#
# I'm telling you, he's mean#
# And my girlfriends be telling me#
# They be seeing him
and he be asking about me#?
And anything you can do
to draw attention
to your mouth is good.
Also, sometimes
you have to show a little skin.
This reminds guys of being naked,
and then they think of sex.
Hey, Duchess?
Yes?
You rashin' this weekend?
Huh?
Like Saturday.
I'm new, but I thought maybe
you had an in on the heavy clambakes.
Well, my ex-stepbrother's friends
are having a party.
Solid.
Daddy had an urgent case.
Some clerks and Josh helped him
go through a gazillion depositions.
[Doorbell Rings]
- [Cher] Daddy!
- What?
I can't open it.
I have to make him wait!
Then he can wait outside.
Josh, please!
Come on, Josh!
Come on!
[Doorbell Rings]
What do you hear?
She's not ready.
Hey, man.
Nice pile of bricks you got here.
You drink?
No, thanks. I'm cool.
I'm not offering.
I'm asking you if you drink.
You think I'd give alcohol
to teenage drivers
taking my daughter out?
The protective vibe. I dig.
You think the death of Sammy Davis
left an opening in the Rat Pack?
Christian.
Doll face.
Handsome.
[Mmwaa]
Stunning.
You're not letting her
go out like that, are you?
Cher, get in here.
- What's up?
- What the hell is that?
A dress.
Says who?
Calvin Klein.
It looks like underwear.
Go upstairs and put
something over it.
Tscha! I was just going to.
Hey, you.
Anything happens to my daughter,
I got a.45 and a shovel.
I doubt anybody would miss you.
Bye, Daddy.
Come on.
Oh, it's so killer!
Thank you.
Your dad is pretty scary.
Isn't he?
You like Billie Holiday?
I love him.
Right.
[Radio]
# Who do you think is coming to town#?
# You'll never guess who#
# Lovable, hugable...#?
I didn't like him.
What's to like?
Maybe I should go to the party.
If you feel like you should go...
You don't need me, do you?
No, no.
Josh, go to the party.
Go, go, go.
O.K.
Uh...
I'll watch her for you.
O.K.
You do that.
# There was a place#
# And the name of the place escapes me#
# When I can't remember,
it irritates me#
# Could be I can't remember#
# Could be I choose to not#
# Let's move along the song
and try to find the plot#
# There was a girl#
# And I don't know
her name, either#
# She gave me love,
and I said I'd never leave her#
# And if I did, I'd come back
someday and find her#
# Maybe I will,
I should write up a reminder#
# One day#
# One day, who knows#?
# Someday#
# Someday I suppose...#?
[Song Continues]
Tai!
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
Tai, are you O.K.?
Shit! That is so embarrassing!
No one saw it.
Now all night long,
I'll be known as
that girl who fell on her butt.
Wow! Are you O.K.?
That looked really bad.
Yeah. Thanks.
Oh, my God, Cher. Look.
He's going with Amber?
No. He's probably
just dancing with her.
Do you think she's pretty?
No. She's a Monet.
What's a Monet?
It's like the paintings, see?
From far away, it's O.K.
Up close, it's a big old mess.
Christian, what do you think of Amber?
Hagsville.
See?
They're charging for brewskies.
Pass me a fin,
I'll pay you back?
Sure.
Thanks.
Oh, he's so cute.
Oh, my God.
Do you see how
he's falling in love with me?
I mean, look how
he ignores every other girl.
Oh, God, look.
There's Josh.
He finds the only adult in here,
like he's deliberately
trying to not have fun.
Cher, I have a question.
What should I do with this thing?
Should I tie it around
or put it over...
Tie it around your waist.
Ready to slide?
Let's go.
# Where did you go?#
# Where did you go?#
# Where did you go??
# Where did you go?#
# Where did you go?#
# You played a tape
I couldn't hear#
# Emptiness began to roam,
and where did you go?#
The band was kickin',
and Christian was
the hottest guy there.
But my enjoyment was put on pause
when I saw how unhappy Tai was.
# ...Wish you sent me
this would end#
# Wrote a note,
then tore it up#
# Poured the beer into a cup,
sat on the couch#
# Drank and smoked,
wondering where did you go...?#
Hi.
Hi.
I think we were born to move.
[Gasp]
Look! Josh is dancing with Tai!
He never dances!
I can see why.
No. He's doing her a prop
so she won't be left out.
Oh, I dig you.
# Get on the floor,
and let's dance some more#
# Get on the floor, and
let's dance some more#
# Get on the floor,
and let's dance some more#
# Get on the floor, and
let's dance some more?#
- How are you guys holding up?
- I am so ready to leave.
I'm tired.
Let's get Christian and go.
Christian!
- You want to go?
- Now?
These guys got the skinny
on the happening after hours.
My trainer's coming really early.
I can take the girls home.
No. That's all right. Thanks.
No. It's fine. Stay.
- You sure?
- Yeah, sure.
Thanks, man. You got my mark.
You are a down girl.
I'll call you tomorrow.
It was really decent of you
to dance with Tai.
My pleasure.
You notice any
positive changes in her?
Yeah. Under your tutelage,
she's exploring the challenging world
of bare midriffs.
So you didn't want
to make a night of it
with the ring-a-ding kid?
Daddy won't go too ballistic.
It's not like he'll sleep.
Not if they're going to
finish those depos.
It would be dope if we got
some really delicious take-out.
I bet they haven't
eaten all night.
That would be
pretty... dope of us.
Let's do it.
The midnight snack
totally revived the lawyers,
and Daddy was way grateful.
Eat oranges. Get Vitamin C.
Daddy, no!
Cher, come on.
You can't have that.
I know it sounds mental,
but sometimes I have
more fun vegging out
than when I go partying.
Maybe because my party clothes
are so binding.
How many hours a day
do you spend grooming yourself?
Some people aren't lucky enough
to be as naturally
adorable as you are.
Stop it. You're making me blush.
[Telephone Rings]
Hello.
Hi, Cher. How are you?
Hi, Gail.
Is my son there,
cleaning out your refrigerator?
No, no, he's not here.
You should try the dorms.
All right. Bye, hon.
Bye-bye.
What was that all about?
She wants me to come home
for spring break.
So? Nobody will be in school.
Husband number four's at home,
and his idea of acting
like a family is to criticize me.
You're going to roam
around campus by yourself?
I don't mind.
That is stupid.
Come here. Have your old room.
There will be some great parties.
No.
Why not?
You got your whole
social world going on.
I'd get in the way.
You won't be in the way.
How much fun would it be
having a brother-type tagging along?
Josh, you're not my brother.
You know what I mean.
Come on. You need
some excitement in your life.
It will replenish you
for your finals.
O.K.
Good.
I can't believe
I'm taking advice
from someone who watches cartoons.
Be quiet, you idiot!
That's Ren & Stimpy.
They're way existential.
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?
No. Why, do I sound like I do?
Ha ha!
[Theme From
2001: A Space Odyssey Playing]
[Ring]
Christian said he'd call the next day.
In boy time, that meant Thursday.
You can imagine my astonishment
to hear from him
while I was packing Daddy up.
He said he'd come over
with some videotapes.
A night alone with Christian?
I sent for reinforcements.
Then Dee and I had
to design a lighting concept.
And costume decisions.
I don't rely on mirrors,
so I always take Polaroids.
# And you're the one
I've always planned to be...#
Whenever a boy comes,
you should always
have something baking.
# I believe I'm you#
# Yes, I do#
# I believe I'm you#
# You know it's true?#
Oh... l'm still all red!
I'm trying to make you
as white as I can, Cher.
Look, you're all flushed.
You have to calm down, O.K.?
Calm.
You know, I am so glad I never did it
with someone I had lukewarm feelings for
because Christian is brutally hot,
and I am going to
remember tonight forever.
Blot.
[Ding-dong]
Hi.
Hi.
Is something burning?
Oh, my God!
Oops.
Aw, honey, you baked.
I tried.
Come on. Show me
the rest of your pad.
Your father has
a well-rounded collection.
Daddy says it's a good investment.
He's absolutely right.
Claes Oldenburg.
He's way famous.
Ooh.
But this is older, see?
Transitional.
A very important piece.
Um, you want to go swimming?
Mmm.
Let's watch the movies.
Oh, O.K.
Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis,
so he brought over Some Like It Hot
and Sparatacus.
Singer of songs.
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?
For the children of my master,
whom I also taught the classics.
Classics, indeed?
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?
You shall be my body servant.
All of you, come with me.
My feet are cold.
Huh. Thanks.
Oh, watch this part.
This is good.
Are you O.K.?
Uh, I'm fine.
Um, do you want some...
something to drink?
I could get you some wine.
No. You notice how wine makes people
want to feel, like, sexy?
Well, that's O.K.
I'm actually getting tired.
But I can make you
some coffee if you'd like.
Oh, no, thanks. Got the ulcer.
But you had all
those cappuccinos before.
Oh. Well, you know,
that was, like, uh, foam.
You're great.
We're friends, right?
Yeah.
Knock me a little kiss.
See you.
I don't get it.
Did my hair get flat?
Did I stumble into
some bad lighting?
What's wrong with me?
Nothing.
Maybe he really was tired.
I suppose it wasn't meant to be.
He does dress better than I do.
What would I bring
to the relationship?
Get back into the right lane...
What's the first thing you do?
First thing I do
is put on my blinker.
- Oh, wait. Shit.
- Watch the road!
Stop. Then I look
in my mirror. O.K.
Then I glance
at my blind spot.
With your head,
not the whole car!
I swear to God.
I swear to God, woman!
You can't drive for shit!
I'm not trying to hear that.
Hear me! You...
Actually, going all the way
is, like, a really big decision.
I can't believe I was
so capricious about it.
Dee, I almost had sex with him.
You almost had sex with who?
Christian.
What?
Yo, look!
Are you bitches blind or something?
Your man Christian is a cake boy.
- A what?
- A what?
He's a disco-dancing,
Oscar-Wilde-reading,
Streisand ticket-holding
friend of Dorothy.
Uh-uh. No way.
He's gay.
Not even.
Yes, even.
He does like to shop, Cher,
and the boy can dress.
Oh, my God.
I'm totally buggin'.
I feel like such a bonehead.
What the hell?
Yo! You're getting on the freeway!
Turn right! Get out of the lane!
No, no! Forget procedure!
Get out of the lane!
Truck! Truck! Truck!
[Horn Honking]
We're on the freeway!
What do I do, Murray?
Go straight! Go straight!
Go straight!
Oh, shit!
Just relax and drive, baby.
Just relax and drive.
O.K.
I'm here with you. I'm here with you.
Shut up!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Whatever you do,
keep your hands
on the wheel at all times!
Aah!
[Horn Honking]
Look, just go!
Aah!
Go to the right!
Oh, there it is.
All right, we're off.
Woo!
Damn. You did wonderful.
It's all right, baby.
Relax, relax, relax.
Honey, relax. Baby, relax.
Breathe, breathe.
Breathe in. Breathe.
Let it out.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Relax, relax.
Boy, getting off the freeway
makes you realize
how important love is.
After that, Dionne's virginity
went from technical to nonexistent.
I realized how much I wanted
a boyfriend of my own.
Not that Christian wasn't
a blast to hang out with.
He was becoming one of
my favorite shopping partners.
So was the red.
Um, where's Tai?
She met some random guys
at the Foot Locker
and escorted them right over there.
Oh, my God! Did you...
I don't know where
she meets these Barneys.
I have a question, all right?
What?
The jacket...
Is it James Dean
or Jason Priestley?
Carpe diem, O.K.?
You looked hot in it.
Really?
If I fall, would you guys catch me?
Could they please be more generic?
Aah! Stop it!
Please!
Bring me back up!
Aah!
Aah!
Let me down!
Thank you.
You asshole!
Hey, man, we're just joking.
Oh, really?
Somebody could get killed.
Oh, my God.
Cher, you don't understand.
I was sitting there.
I was just talking to those guys.
All of a sudden,
we were laughing and...
Hey, you O.K.?
Y-yeah.
You sure?
I'm fine. Uh-huh.
Let's get you home for some R and R.
What's that?
Boy, considering
how clueless she was,
Tai certainly had
that damsel-in-distress act down.
Meanwhile, back at school,
everyone was talking about
Tai's brush with death at the mall.
Was it a montage of all the scenes
in your life?
Not exactly a montage.
Hey, Cher, is it true gang members
tried to shoot Tai?
No.
That's what everyone's saying.
Whatever.
When I was 9,
I fell off this jungle gym.
I swear I saw this...
Will you move down for Cher?
Tell me more. Tell me more.
Where was I?
You were thinking about
what was really important.
Oh, right, right.
Right before you die,
your mind just
sort of gets very clear.
It's a very intense spiritual thing.
I know when I was held
at gunpoint...
Excuse me. You were saying?
It's spiritual.
I can't pinpoint the spirituality.
If you've never
experienced anything...
Tai, I was planning on going to Tower
and getting something for Christian.
Uh-huh.
Like some kind
of present or something.
- You want to come?
- Sure. I owe him my life.
I'll get you after school.
Yeah.
Not today. I'm going
over to Melrose with Amber.
We're going to Melrose.
Oh. Well, how about tomorrow?
Do you think we could
do it next Monday?
My week's filling up fast here.
When we got back
from the IHOP, it was 8:00.
Here comes your boyfriend.
Tai, check it out.
- Ew!
- Ew!
Hey, could you shove down
a little bit?
No.
Don't the slackers prefer
that grassy knoll over there?
Tai, so anyway,
have you ever done it in water?
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?
What was happening?
Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?
Tai being the most popular girl
in the school?
It was like
some sort of alternate universe.
On top of everything else,
I was going to take the driving test,
so I had to find my most
responsible-looking ensemble.
Where's my white collarless shirt?
Lucy, where's my shirt?
Probably at the cleaner.
Oh, but today's the driving test.
It's my most capable-looking outfit.
O.K., I call them.
Oh, it's too late now.
Oh, we got another notice
from the fire department,
saying we have to
clear out the bush.
You said Jose would do it.
He your gardener. You tell him.
Lucy, I don't speak Mexican.
I not a Mexican!
Great. What was that all about?
Lucy's from El Salvador.
So?
It's an entirely different country.
What does that matter?
You get upset if someone
thinks you live below Sunset.
So everything is all my fault.
I'm always wrong, right?
You're such a brat.
I had an overwhelming sense of ickyness.
Even though I apologized to Lucy,
something was still plaguing me.
Like Josh thinking
I was mean was making me postal.
Move into the right lane.
Anyway, why should I care
what Josh thinks?
Why was I letting it throw me
into such turmoil?
Watch out for the bike rid...
Oops! My bad.
What are you doing?
You can't take up both lanes.
Get in the right lane.
Not so...
Ooh! Should I write them a note?
Pull over up here
and turn off the engine.
Right there.
Oh!
Are you going to take me somewhere
to make left-hand turns?
We're going back.
It's over?
It's over.
Well, how did I do?
How did you do?
Well, let's see, shall we?
You can't park,
you can't switch lanes,
you can't make
right-hand turns,
you've damaged private property,
and you almost killed someone.
Offhand, I'd say you failed.
Failed?
Well, can't we just start over?
I mean, I'm kind
of having a personal problem.
My mind was somewhere else.
That biker came out of nowhere!
Oh! I swear I'll concentrate!
I drive really good, usually.
Isn't there somebody else
I can talk to?
You can't be
the absolute and final word
in driver's licenses.
Girlie, as far
as you're concerned,
I'm the messiah of the DMV.
Now, get out of the car.
I can't believe I failed.
I failed something
I couldn't talk my way out of?
[Josh]
Go ahead, yeah.
Put your legs into me.
Hey, you're home.
How does it feel
to have a license?
I wouldn't know. I failed.
Oh. Bummer.
And, Josh, spare me your lectures
on how driving is
such a big responsibility
and you can't B.S.
your way through it.
I didn't say anything.
I know what you're thinking.
I got to tell you something.
I'm really sorry about your test.
I am so glad you're here.
There's something I got to do.
I need you here. Does this work?
Yeah. What is this stuff?
A bunch of junk
that reminded me of Elton.
I want to burn it
because I'm so over him.
What stuff?
Do you remember
when we were at the Val party
and the clog knocking me out
and Elton got a towel of ice?
I didn't tell you at the time,
but I took the towel as a souvenir.
You're kidding.
No.
And then...
remember that song
that was playing when we danced?
Remember that?
You know, Rollin' With The Homies.
Anyways, I got the tape, right?
I listened to it, like,
every single night.
Don't burn that, O.K.?
Tai, I'm really happy for you,
but what brought on
this surge of empowerment?
It's, like, I met this guy
who's so totally amazing
that he makes Elton
look like a loser.
That is so great.
Look, you've got to
help me get Josh.
Get Josh what?
You know what I mean?
I like him.
Do you think
that he likes you?
Yeah.
How do you know?
Like, little things, you know?
Like, he always finds
some sort of way
to touch me or tickle me.
Do you remember
the time at the frat
when I was totally depressed?
We danced, and he was really flirty.
You O.K.?
Yeah. Oh, actually...
I was really bad today.
I had two mochaccinos.
I feel like ralphing.
I know exactly how that feels.
Like, the other day,
I was talking to Josh,
and we were discussing
the difference
between high school girls
and college girls.
College girls wear less makeup.
That's why guys like them more.
But, Tai, do you really think
you'd be good with Josh?
I mean, he's, like,
a school nerd.
Am I some sort of
a mentally challenged airhead?
No! Not even!
I didn't say that.
I'm not good enough
for Josh or something?
l... I just... don't think
you mesh well together.
You don't think
that we mesh well?
Why am I even listening to you
to begin with?
You're a virgin who can't drive.
Oh, that was way harsh, Tai.
All right. Look, I'm really sorry.
Let's just talk when
we've mellowed, all right?
I'm Audi.
What did I do?
I've created some sort of a monster.
I could feel the chunks
start to rise up in my throat.
I had to get out.
# When I was young#
# I never needed anyone#
Everything I think
and everything I do is wrong.
I was wrong about Elton.
I was wrong about Christian.
Now Josh hated me.
It all boiled down to
one inevitable conclusion...
I was just totally clueless.
Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing
was wiggin' me more than anything.
What was my problem? Tai is my pal.
I don't begrudge her a boyfriend.
I really... Ooh!
I wonder if they have that in my size.
What does she want with Josh anyway?
He dresses funny.
He listens to complaint rock.
He's not even cute...
in a conventional way.
I mean, he's just like this slug
who hangs around
the house all the time.
And he's a hideous dancer.
Couldn't take him anywhere.
Wait a second.
What am I stressing about?
This is, like, Josh.
# All by myself?#
O.K., O.K.,
so he's kind of a Baldwin.
What would he want with Tai?
She couldn't make him happy.
Josh needs someone with imagination,
someone to take care of him,
someone to laugh at his jokes...
in case he ever makes any.
Then suddenly...
Oh, my God.
I love Josh.
I am majorly, totally,
crazy in love with Josh.
But now I don't know
how to act around him.
I mean, ordinarily,
I'd strut around him
in my cutest little outfits
and send myself flowers and candy,
but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh.
What's with you?
What do you mean?
You're so quiet.
You haven't made me
watch The Real World.
I care about the news.
Since when?
Since now.
...ln Central Bosnia.
You look confused.
Well, uh, I thought they
declared peace in the Middle East.
Cher, get in here!
What's up, Daddy?
What are you doing dancing
in front of my office?
Nothing. I just wanted to see
if you need any help with anything.
Yeah, you can help me
with something.
Come over here.
All right.
Every time that you see
a telephone conversation
that took place on September 3rd,
highlight it.
- Just September 3rd.
- O.K.
It's fun, huh?
Yeah.
O.K.
Daddy, did you ever have a problem
that you couldn't
argue your way out of?
Tell me the problem,
and we'll figure out how to argue it.
I like this boy,
and he likes someone else.
How could that be?
I don't know. I feel wretched.
Obviously, this boy
is a complete moron.
You are the most beautiful girl
in Beverly Hills.
And to tell you the truth,
I'm not sure I want you
with a stupid fellow.
Well, actually, he is a smart guy.
He's one of those do-gooder types.
I feel like my after-school
commitments aren't good enough.
How can you say that?
Who takes care of everyone
in this household?
Who makes sure that
Daddy eats right?
I have not seen
such good-doing since your mother.
Really?
Really.
Now, get back to work.
Later, while we were learning
about the Pismo Beach disaster,
I decided I needed
a complete makeover,
except this time,
I'd makeover my soul.
But what makes somebody
a better person?
Then I realized all my friends
were good in different ways.
Like Christian,
he always wants things
to be beautiful and interesting.
Or Dionne and Murray,
when they think no one is watching,
are so considerate of each other.
And poor Miss Geist,
always trying to get us involved
no matter how much we resist.
Oh. That's just...
That doesn't even show...
Every single possession,
every memory,
everything you've had
your whole life
gone in a second.
Can you imagine
what that must feel like?
Elton?
Can I use the pass?
Yeah. We'll be collecting blankets,
disposable diapers,
uh, canned goods.
Miss Geist?
Cher?
I want to help.
That would be wonderful.
I felt better already.
Daddy!
What?
You didn't like that
red caviar, did you?
What's she talking about?
Ew!
Cher, what are you doing?
I'm captain of the Pismo Beach
disaster relief.
I don't think
they need your skis.
Daddy, some people lost
all their belongings.
Don't you think that includes
athletic equipment?
This is your influence, Josh?
# Shake, some action's what I need#
# To make a bus stop at full speed#
# And I'm sure that's all you'll need#
# To make it all right?#
...Really fun.
It's so pretty.
Should I leave it here?
Could you bring it to bedding?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Miss Geist,
I need more boxes.
They're all filled up.
Already? Great.
I divided them into
entrees and appetizers.
Oh. O.K.
I'll have them picked up.
Uh!
Hey.
Proper. This is really decent
of you, Travis.
Sure.
I wasn't sure about that.
I don't need it anymore,
but far be it for me
to deny anyone else.
I'm sorry about your shoes.
What shoes?
The red ones with the strappy thing.
Oh, those are so last-season.
What made you think of them?
It's one of my steps.
I joined this club,
and there are these steps.
There's, like...
12?
Yeah. How did you know?
Wild guess.
Wow. Good guess.
Uh, also, here.
ASL.
Amateur skateboarding league.
This clarity thing,
it's brought me to a whole new level.
My skating...
Would you come Saturday?
Sure.
Ah, cool.
Ha ha!
Well, um,
I guess kitchenware?
That's where I used to keep it.
Hi.
Hi.
Cher, can I talk
to you a minute?
Um, sure.
Look, I have been in agony
for the past week.
I can't believe
I went off the way I did.
No. I have been going
down a shame spiral.
I can't believe
I was so unsupportive
of your feelings for Josh.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I'm the tard here.
Cher, you've been nothing
but super-duper nice to me.
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have liked Elton.
I'm so sorry, Tai.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, shit. Now I'm going
to go ahead and cry.
Let's never fight again, O.K.?
Next up, number 14,
Travis Birkenstock.
Woo! All right, Travis!
I had no idea
he was so motivated.
Oh, I did.
When I saw the sparks
between Tai and Travis,
I knew Josh was
out of the picture.
You look like Pippi Longstocking.
You look like Forrest Gump.
Who's Pippi Longstocking?
Uh, someone Mel Gibson
never played.
You're funny.
What happened to
the August 28th files?
Hmm? What?
Mel wanted them tonight.
There were twice as many.
He's going to go ballistic.
Where are they?
I think I checked them
for the September 3rd
conversations.
What?
Where'd you put them?
I divided them
into two piles.
I have to redo all that.
Are you some kind of idiot?
Hey, she didn't know.
She just set us back a day.
Who cares about
the September call?
I'm sorry.
Just forget it.
Just go back to the mall
or something.
[Josh]
What's your problem, man?
She didn't mean any harm.
I'll get killed
'cause she's a moron.
She's not a moron.
If you were paying attention,
it wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't have been
playing footsie,
she wouldn't be bothering me.
What the hell are you talking about?
This is a multimillion dollar lawsuit,
not some excuse for puppy love.
We've worked
our butts off on this case!
Do whatever you want
with your butts.
I'm calling in sick.
Did I really ruin
Daddy's lawsuit?
No.
Of course not.
Well, did I set him back?
I mean, there's
so much work to be done,
and he can't afford
to lose that time.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
Your father won't lose any time.
Can you imagine
the nerve of that guy?
I mean, making
you worry like that.
He's the one that screwed up.
Then he goes and blames us.
Imagine saying we were...
you know.
That's right. You've been
very dedicated to this case.
Yeah. Well, it was
a good learning experience.
At least for me.
I want to be a lawyer.
But you, I mean,
you don't need to be doing this.
Go out and have fun.
Go shopping.
You think that's all I do?
I'm just a ditz
with a credit card?
No, no.
That's not what I meant.
It's just... um...
Uh, th...
You're... young
and beautiful and...
And?
And, uh, well, what?
You think I'm beautiful?
Mmm... yeah, a little.
You know you're gorgeous,
all right?
And popular and, uh, and...
but this is not
why I come here.
This is a good
learning experience for me.
You already said that.
Mel. I want to help out Mel.
He's the only one
who cares about me.
That's not true.
He's not?
No.
Are you saying...
you care about me?
Josh.
Well, you can guess
what happened next.
As if!
I am only 16.
This is California, not Kentucky.
You may kiss the bride.
I know that
when I have my own wedding,
I want this, like,
whole, entire floral motif,
like, very floral garlands.
No, no, no.
When I get married,
I'll have a sailor dress,
but it will be a gown.
My bridesmaids
will wear sailor hats.
They're planning
our weddings already.
Could you all stop that
till death do us part
mumbo jumbo?
I'm completely buggin'.
I'm buggin' myself.
Girls, she's about
to throw the bouquet!
Come on!
We got a pool going to see
whose girl gets the bouquet.
It's up to $200.
It's in the bag.
All right, come on, girls.
Hey! Over here! Over here!
