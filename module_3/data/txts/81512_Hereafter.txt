Come on, get up.
You need to buy gifts for your kids
before we leave.
I'll pick up something at the airport.
No way.
Airport gifts suck.
Marie, please let me sleep
another half hour.
Fine.
If you won't buy the gifts
for your kids, I will.
Can you ask the front desk
to prepare the bill...
...and have some breakfast sent up?
You know what?
The posters are up, all over paris.
Apparently, you can't miss them.
How many have you seen?
Really?
Good morning.
Could you prepare the bill for 321?
- Sure.
- And could you send up some breakfast...
...coffee and fruit?
- Okay, I'll call room service.
- Thank you.
They said there would be
120 across paris.
Can you sum up the headlines for me?
I won't have time to go online.
That's good.
Big kisses, bye-bye.
Hello.
Oh, I like this one.
You have more like this?
Yes?
Yes. Take this one. Yes.
- How much?
- One dollar.
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me your hand! Give me--
Give me your hand!
Can you reach me? Take my hand.
- All right, hold on.
- She's not breathing.
Think she's gone, dude.
- Get back, get back!
- Everybody get off the boat!
Come on.
Roll her over on her side.
- Breathe, breathe.
- Vomit it out. Good, vomit.
Turn her back around.
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yeah.
- You're okay.
- We got you.
Slow. Slow down.
Marie.
Come in and have a seat.
I'll go talk to my brother, okay?
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay. Sit, sit, sit.
- Hey.
- How could you do this to me?
- What?
- You know I don't do this anymore.
Just one time. This guy's a real important
client of mine. I need this. Come on.
- This is it.
- I know.
- This is it.
- I know.
Okay. Mr...?
Andreou. Christos.
Christos. Okay.
I'm gonna hold your hands just until
I get a connection, and then...
...just for the purposes of the reading,
confine your answers to yes or no.
Give me your hands?
A woman close to you has passed?
Yes.
- In her middle age? Was she in her fifties?
- Yes.
Was this woman your wife?
Yes.
And I'm picking up you were together
for a long time.
Yep.
- But it wasn't always easy.
- No.
- Now I'm picking up she was sick.
- Yep.
She was sick for a long time.
Did she have difficulty moving?
Yes.
Was she bedridden?
Yes. She had multiple sclerosis.
I'm sorry.
She wants to apologize to you
for ruining the marriage.
That's not true.
She feels bad that you had to care for her,
even as a young man...
...and wishes that you'd find someone now,
before it's too late.
Because you're not getting any younger.
Or slimmer.
No.
She's got quite a sense of humor.
- Yeah.
- She's really funny.
Okay, wait. Now she's telling me
to pay attention.
Okay, she has something important
she needs to say.
Okay, she's trying to give me
some kind of a date. June.
In June?
Did that mean anything to you?
- No.
- Is that when you were married? June?
- Is that when she passed?
- No.
I mean, she's being very specific
about June.
Yeah, June.
Hm. Well, maybe I'm wrong.
That happens.
I don't even do this anymore.
Guess I'm rusty.
Thank you. I can't thank you enough.
- Hey. Thanks, baby brother.
- Okay.
I owe you.
That was incredible.
Your brother, I'm telling you,
he's for real.
- I know.
- No, no, no. He's really for real.
I gotta tell you I was skeptical
before I came. All this psychic shit is...
...mumbo-fucking-jumbo
as far as I'm concerned.
He was telling me things
I'd never told anybody.
- He could make money.
- He did. Good money.
Had an office, website, newspaper articles,
even had a book written about him.
Yeah? So, what happened?
Couldn't cope.
Turned his back on the whole thing.
He told me, he said, "A life
that's all about death is no life at all."
He works at a factory and makes 2 grand
a month. He says he's happy.
Who knows?
He wasn't gonna do this again.
I had to persuade him
to make an exception.
Well, I appreciate it, man.
I mean, this was....
I owe you. All right,
I'll talk to you Monday about that thing?
Yeah. Great, Christos, thanks.
Hey. What was with June,
if you don't mind me asking?
June Menendez was my wife's nurse.
Took care of her for 15 years.
For 10 of those years,
I was in love with her.
And I felt so guilty
I couldn't tell anybody.
Least of all June herself.
Right.
All right, I'll see you.
We might have gone about half a mile...
...and my pocket handkerchief
was quite wet through...
...when looking out, to my amazement,
I saw Peggotty burst from a hedge.
She jumped up into the carriage.
Not a single word did she speak.
She squeezed me until the pressure
on my nose was extremely painful...
...crammed some pieces of cake
into my pockets..
...and a purse,
which she put into my hand.
Then she got down and ran away.
Presently, I noticed one of her buttons
rolling around on the floor.
I picked it up and treasured it
as a keepsake for a long time.
Okay, you two. Yeah.
Oh, lovely. Come on, you guys.
Which one of you two is the oldest?
- Twelve minutes.
- Really? Do you know, I think I could tell.
- And you're Marcus?
- No, he's Marcus.
- Right.
- The quiet one.
Uh-huh. Oh. Aw.
- I was gonna say the handsome one.
- I'm Jason.
Jason, yeah, all right.
The oldest. The chatterbox.
The smartass.
Lovely. Think we're done.
Okey-dokey. What did you guys do,
rob a phone box?
- Thank you.
- Go on.
- Bye.
- Cheers, bye-bye.
- What's the matter?
- I don't understand it. Can I copy yours?
- No.
- please. It has to be in tomorrow.
Tough bananas.
She can see it in the morning.
Good night, Jase.
Good night.
Shit.
Jackie? Are you in there?
Come on, open up.
Come on, wake up.
Open up, please!
Boys, it's no use.
We know you're covering for her.
Wake her up. Make her look better.
Social Services.
Mom! Mom, wake up!
Jackie, you in there?
She's not here. She's gone to the shops.
Mom, come on!
We're gonna wait.
Boys, it's no use.
We know you're covering for her.
Come on, Mom. Get up, please!
Come on. You're wasting our time.
If she's not here in five minutes...
...we'll call the police Child protective Unit.
Come on. Open up.
He means that! Five minutes!
Thanks. I've got it.
Jason, open the door.
You can come in
and wait for her if you want.
Have a seat.
Thanks.
Hope she won't be much longer.
I'm home!
Hello. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.
Hi.
I completely forgot you were
gonna be here.
Jason, go put the kettle on.
Marcus, go and get a plate.
Let's get these biscuits out.
- Have you been here long?
- A while.
Sorry.
It's all right, Jackie.
Why don't you sit down?
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking that is the best present
in the whole wide world.
Absolutely love it. Thank you.
Thank you.
My boys.
- Marcus, will you do something?
- Yeah.
- Get the red box in the cupboard.
- Yes, Mom.
Thank you.
Now, I want you to go down
to the chemist.
Give this to the nice man.
Then he'll know what to do, okay?
- Yes, Mom.
- Thank you, baby.
- I'll do it.
- Why?
Marcus hasn't done his homework yet.
- Go on, then.
- Call me on this and I'll talk you through it.
Yeah, but not long, okay?
I haven't got any credit.
Take care, Jason, okay?
- I will.
- I'll see you later.
And why haven't you done
your homework?
Come here, you.
Look at your silly little face. An angel.
Okay. It's okay. Forget about your
homework. You can copy mine.
I want you to look up
naltrexone and hydrochloride.
Okay. Hang on a minute.
Found it. I think this is it.
"Naltrexone blocks the effects
of heroin and of opiates.
Detoxification can last between
a week and a month."
Does that mean she's stopping?
Yeah, I think that's exactly
what it means.
This is great. She's never done this before
up till now. It's just been promises.
- Yeah, I knew it was just a matter of time.
- There you are.
Thank you.
Just think. It'd be like living
in a normal family for once.
That kid's got a mobile.
Hey, little one.
Hey, come here, lad.
Leave me alone!
Give me your phone, mate.
Give me that back!
Jase?
What do you got pills for?
You're a little freak.
Get your phone, brother.
Get your phone.
- Grab him!
- Wait a minute, little prick!
- Come here!
- Little prick!
Come on, little prick!
Come on, you little dickhead,
where you going?
Jase?
Marcus!
Jason?
Jason?
please, Jason.
Jason, come on. I need you.
please.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Jason!
Jason, come on. please, Jase.
Jase.
I feel bad.
I should've stayed on to cover the story.
After what happened to you?
They've sent a crew
from the Hong Kong office.
I've never done that...
...run away from such a story.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Should I come up?
- No, I'll be fine.
I almost forgot...
...the gifts for your kids.
I love you.
The estimated
figures are at several billion dollars
But of course, we're going to talk
about the survivors..
...because we hope there are survivors
The number of victims is estimated
at several hundred thousand.
It is a horrific scene here,
as this tsunami...
...has devastated the population.
Good evening, everyone.
Marie, can you hear me?
Mm-hm.
Everybody, break a leg.
Ready and on the air in...
...five, four...
...three, two...
...and cue, Miss Lelay.
Good evening,
and welcome to a new edition...
...of Window on Events.
Tonight, our guest is
Guillaume Belcher...
...CEO of famous
clothing manufacturer Soucil.
We're going to present to you
a shocking investigation...
...on child labor in their factories
in Southeast Asia.
Cyril Guignard reporting.
Here in the West, it's
easy to criticize Third World labor practices
But the truth is..
...these factories..
...play a vital role in
industrial development...
...and evolution of poorer countries.
And let's be clear about this,
the wages we are paying...
...are substantially higher
than local wages.
Marie, go at him!
Marie, do you hear me?
pull this guy apart!
You hear me, get him!
But will this kind of justification satisfy
French customers...
...Mr. Belcher?
If they were aware of the conditions
under which the clothes are produced...
...do you think you would
still be profitable?
Go there and you'll see how much
these people need us.
Thank you for watching.
That's all for now, see you next week.
I'm sorry, that was unforgivable.
We'll fix it in the edit. No one will notice.
And it was my fault.
A defensive CEO was a tough start
for the new season.
Do you want to get something to eat?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I think something happened
to me out there.
You had a close call.
No, something really happened to me.
When I went underwater...
...I had visions.
I don't know.
You had a concussion.
You hit your head.
Hm?
You're right.
Two right-wing newspapers
claim Sikhs were out in the streets...
...burning cars, looting shops.
Others say the unrest was triggered by
elements within the nationalist parties...
...to cast negative suspicion
on racial minorities.
What do you think about
the story on the Sikhs?
What?
The story on the Sikhs,
what do you think?
It's very good.
Listen, I've got to work late
and finish some things.
See you tomorrow.
Can I say something...
...you might find difficult to hear?
I think you came back to work too soon.
physically, you're fine.
But since the accident....
Take some time off
to get over what happened.
Just a couple of weeks.
To "get over"?
You've always said you wanted to write.
Your book idea, Michel would jump on it
and pay good money.
But that would take time.
This will all be here waiting for you.
What matters is that you feel better.
We need you too much.
I'll think about it.
Hey.
You see that meeting going on?
On the first floor?
- The head office guys and the union?
- No, no, I didn't.
Yeah, well, they were in there
all afternoon.
Kind of makes you think
the rumors are true, huh?
What rumor?
That they're gonna let 30 percent of
the workforce go. You heard that, right?
Yeah, right. Right.
What's the matter with you today?
No, I just didn't get
a lot of sleep last night.
Well, see you tomorrow, all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you.
- Yeah.
Down the end of the hall, on your left.
Hi there.
Welcome, all of you,
to this 10-week course in Italian cuisine.
My name is Carlo.
Some of you know me already.
You've done some of my other courses.
Those of you that don't, buonasera,
and you can call me "Chef."
We'll be working in pairs
throughout the course...
...so one of the first things I want to do
today is to pair you all up.
All right? Don't be shy. Grab a partner.
I see some of you have
come in twos already.
Others have worked together before.
Okay. Now who's left?
Excuse me. God. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The roads were closed
for some reason...
...plus this jerk in registration took an age
processing my application.
Am I too late?
No. No, no. Not at all.
What is your name?
- Melanie.
- We were just pairing people off.
Why don't we put you with....
- What is your name?
- George.
Melanie with George.
And, Alice, you're with....
Tony.
How you doing, Tony?
- Sorry.
- All right.
Now, in exercise class,
you warm up with stretches.
We're gonna warm up
with a glass of Barbaresco...
...a beautiful wine from the piedmont
region in northwestern Italy...
- ...made from the Nebbiolo grape.
- Hi. George.
Take a sip.
Mm. Mm.
And some music.
Because cooking is all the senses, right?
The nose, the eyes, the palate and the ears.
And tonight, we're gonna start
at the beginning.
The cornerstone of so much
of Italian cooking...
...the classic tomato sauce
from Toscana.
And in preparation, we're gonna need
chopped tomatoes, so let's get chopping.
Take your time. Doing all right?
Look at these beautiful tomatoes, huh?
Ah, the music. Is this beautiful?
God, some of them are really good.
Is this your first time?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, mine too.
I read in the brochure that the course
builds to a competition.
I saw that. To be judged
by a local restaurant critic.
Yeah. I don't think we should
get our hopes up. Heh, heh.
Well, we still have 10 weeks.
- Well, that's true.
- And we haven't cut our fingers off yet.
That's a good attitude.
Which one of us is using the wrong knife?
Am I using the wrong knife?
Yeah. You're using that.
The woman next to me
brought her own knife.
- Really?
- Very intimidating.
So I'll see you next week.
Great. Yeah. See you next week.
- George Lonegan?
- Yeah.
I hate to bother you.
I'm Mr. Andreou's neighbor.
The Greek guy, mid-fifties,
who lost his wife.
I believe you recently did
a reading for him.
- I'm just gonna stop you.
- Candace.
Okay, Candace,
I don't do readings anymore.
You did one last week for Mr. Andreou.
He's an associate of my brother's.
It was a one-time thing.
please, I give you my word.
I won't tell anyone.
- I'm sorry.
- Listen, listen, listen. I brought money.
- I don't want your money.
- Everything I have.
I lost my child.
My only child. Just a baby.
I just wanna talk to her.
please, I wanna talk to my baby.
I can't help you. I don't do that anymore!
- please!
- Mr. Lonegan! I got money!
Mr. Lonegan. please.
I wanna talk to my baby.
Go, girls! There you go! Kick it!
So another person came to see me
for a reading.
Thanks to your friend Mr. Andreou.
- What?
- Yeah.
Told that Greek jerk to keep
his big mouth shut.
Go, girls! Kick it back!
You gotta kick it back!
Well, obviously he didn't.
I'll talk with him, make sure nothing
like that ever happens again.
Okay.
And?
- And what?
- Did you do it?
- What?
- The reading.
- Did you do the reading?
- You still don't get it, do you?
You think just because I can
make money doing this...
...just because I can that I should do it.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I also think you have a duty to do it
because you have a gift.
It's not a gift, Billy. It's a curse.
You have no idea. It ruins any chance
I have at a normal life.
Feel like a freak.
Freak?
Freak or not, Georgie, it's who you are.
It's what you are, you know.
You can't run from that forever.
To divert
his thoughts from this melancholy subject...
...I informed Mr. Micawher that I
relied on him for a bowl of punch...
...and led him to the lemons
His recent despondency,
not to say despair, was gone in a moment.
I never saw a man
so thoroughly enjoy himself...
...amid the fragrance of lemon peel
and sugar, and the smell of burning rum...
...as he stirred and mixed and tasted...
...and looked as if he were making,
instead of punch...
...a fortune for his family
to last for all posterity.
Death is not final.
It is merely the beginning.
Gateway to an afterlife that reflects
our conduct here on earth.
God, in his infinite generosity,
has created heaven...
...which is where Jason is now...
...surrounded by all the angels and saints,
looking down at us.
And so we commit Jason's body to dust,
his soul already in God's care.
Jason's ashes will be available
at the back...
...but if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like you to leave through the front door.
Morning.
please come in.
Thank you.
Morning.
Good night, Jase.
It won't be for long.
It's a short-term placement.
Just until your mum feels better.
The couple we have in mind have a lot of
experience and live close to where you live.
Of course you'll stay at the same school.
I don't wanna go with anyone else.
I wanna stay with you.
Where are you going?
Just give us a minute, will you?
Look, I need a little time
to sort myself out.
But I'm not running away, I promise.
I could stay with you now,
and I want that so much.
But chances are I wouldn't make it,
because I'm not strong enough.
I don't expect you to understand.
And I know for me to leave you now...
...it must feel like the worst thing
in the world.
But I promise you I'm not gonna
let you down, okay?
I promise you.
I'm so sorry.
I love you. Come here.
Come here.
Be a good boy.
Come on.
Summing up France's postwar
history, only two statesmen counted:
De Gaulle and him.
On de Gaulle, everything's been written.
On Mitterrand, I want to finish the job.
There are fascinating elements.
The abolition of the death penalty,
the European Union.
Coming from a right-wing family,
he seduced the left.
And what's more,
converted it to liberalism.
Amazing! It was a revolution, right?
plus the darker sides of his character
that have never been explored.
He's been dead for 10 years.
The timing is right, we can dig deeper.
I want to dig into his past.
Vichy, the Elf scandal....
What part did he play?
The Taiwan frigates,
the papon scandal...
...Mazarine, Marguerite Duras.
These stories were never really addressed.
They've all been buried.
I'm going to tell who knew,
who didn't talk.
Isn't that going to bring us
too much controversy?
I don't think so.
What I want is a book
that can be read by all.
Mitterrand was not just a politician.
Mitterrand was an icon.
He's "Tonton," our uncle!
Maybe that's what we should use
as the title!
- Tonton.
- Heh, heh, heh.
I'm not sure we can keep that title.
Of course not. It was a joke.
I'll welcome your suggestions
for the title.
How about Chipping Away at the Myth
or The Vacillating Statue?
I look forward to your suggestions.
We'll make a list.
Congratulations.
The timing couldn't be better.
politically, there's nothing going on
now anyway.
You'll write the book you've always
wanted to. You'll get some rest.
Come this summer,
you'll be back on the air...
...with a bestseller under your belt,
and a big renegotiated contract.
Stronger than ever.
Exactly.
Adapting and turning misfortune
to your advantage.
That's what I've always loved about you,
never a victim.
That's right.
Never a victim, never vulnerable,
never complains.
Excuse me. Your table is ready.
Great. I'm starving.
Can I ask you something?
What do you think happens
when we die?
That's a strange question!
Tell me.
When you die, you die.
The lights go out, that's it.
Why?
That's it? Just blackout?
Totally black, the plug's pulled out.
The eternal void.
Don't you think it's possible
that there is something?
Like what?
I don't know, something....
A hereafter.
No, I don't.
If that were the case, wouldn't someone
have discovered it by now?
And there would be proof.
I guess.
Do you have a lot of questions like that?
More champagne?
Huh?
Okay, does everyone have
their blindfolds on?
Okay.
Now, if you wanna be a good cook,
first we need to work on your palate.
To stimulate your imaginations,
your senses.
No good being an expert chopper,
dicer, roaster, toaster...
...if you can't give names and colors,
and even shapes, to flavors.
Okay. Now, spoon number one.
Now, look, this isn't easy. So don't worry
if you don't immediately identify it.
Let's start by trying to describe it.
What is the texture?
Okay, you ready?
- What is the consistency?
- Open.
Very good.
What?
I have no freaking idea what this is.
"No freaking idea." Okay.
But, um....
It's not a fruit.
It's kind of nutty.
- But it's kind of sweet too. I think.
- Okay.
"A little nutty."
"Kind of sweet."
- Did she get it?
- Yeah.
So how are we gonna do this?
What?
Well, we could make up a whole
load of crap, or we could...
...cut to the chase and be honest
with one another.
About?
About why we're both doing
night-school classes?
- All right.
- Open.
Everybody okay? How we doing?
Mm.
There's, um....
There's something oaky about that.
"Oaky." Okay.
- Yeah. Nutmeggy? I think.
- Okay.
You're not gonna tell me it's
because you wanna make...
...the perfect spaghetti vongole, right?
No, not entirely.
Okay. I'll jump in.
I'm doing this because
I'm new to San Francisco.
Because I'm looking
to make new friends.
And who knows? If I'm lucky,
maybe even meet the man of my dreams.
- Here, open.
- Okay.
So why'd you move to San Francisco?
Uh....
Because I got dumped by someone
in pittsburgh.
Sorry.
Not quite at the aisle, but pretty close.
Down payment on the wedding dress,
honeymoon booked. That kind of thing.
I mean, it's okay. You know, I'm....
I'm over it, just about.
Not at all, actually.
What'd that taste like?
Oh. Um....
I don't know.
I mean, I really-- I don't....
- Wanna try again?
- Yeah, okay.
Okay.
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.
Okay.
- Is that a bean?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You know what color it is?
It's like....
Tastes like a black bean.
- Am I right?
- Yes.
How we doing? Don't be shy.
- Here we go.
- Oh, well...
...like you, I recently made
a big change to my life...
...and I just wanted to reevaluate things
and change my priorities.
What was--? What was the change?
Divorce or...?
Oh, no, no, nothing like that. No.
A job that I needed to put behind me.
It was making
any kind of life impossible.
Definitely a nut.
You're not gonna tell me,
you know, what the job was?
Would you mind if I didn't?
I mean, don't worry,
I wasn't like a criminal or anything.
- Okay. So open up.
- Okay.
No hitting on Alice.
- peppers.
- Yeah.
- Wasn't that great?
- Yeah, fun.
God, it's made me so hungry.
Yeah, me too.
Do you wanna get something to eat?
Yeah. There's actually a place nearby
that everyone's talking about.
place nearby, are you kidding me?
We're practically experts ourselves.
- I can drive.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, great, okay.
So you been in San Francisco long?
Born and bred, yeah.
Oh, nice.
You can just leave all that. I'll get it.
You just get comfortable.
No, I'm your partner. Remember?
I have to....
- We have to do this together.
- Okay.
Oh, my gosh. Are these...?
- This is you? As a kid?
- Yeah, that's me and my brother, Billy.
Let me tell you, you got the looks.
Well, he got everything else.
Are these his kids?
Yeah. My nieces.
Hm.
Who's this?
Is this some kind of ancestor?
No, that's Charles Dickens.
- Oh.
- I'm a fan. I'm a huge fan.
You know, people go on and on
about Shakespeare and it's--
I mean, he's great, of course,
but Dickens....
No, no, I'll get that. I got it.
There's a-- There's a little trick.
Hey. It's Billy.
Just to say I finally
caught up with our Greek friend.
Told him to keep his mouth shut. Okay?
Just relax. There shouldn't be
any more freaks..
...knocking on your door asking
for readings, you know?
I gotta say though, this guy...
...he made a big point of saying
how brilliant you were...
...and with so many fakers out there,
someone who had a genuine gift.
I don't know--
Sorry about that.
Uh....
- What gift?
- Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it.
No, I mean, I'm interested.
Well, the job I had before,
it was as a psychic.
I know, but....
- What?
- But it's true.
I had an illness as a child...
...and I had an infection,
which turned into a fever...
...which turned into inflammation
of my brain and spinal cord.
It's called encephalomyelitis.
And they had to operate,
in the back, here.
It was a complicated procedure. It was
eight hours. And they nearly lost me.
Actually, technically, they did lose me...
...and bring me back
on a number of occasions.
Anyway, they cured the illness...
...but they must've messed up something
else while they were back there, because...
...not long after,
I started to have these migraines.
And then nightmares.
And then these connections.
And one day I'm sitting with a friend,
and I had a vision of a woman...
...a crystal-clear vision.
And I described her to him.
And turned out it was an exact description
of his mother, someone I'd never met...
...who'd died the previous week.
And you're not laughing yet.
No, I'm not.
Well, anyway, I assumed
it was some kind of a coincidence.
But as time went on, I began having more
and more of these things, connections.
So the doctors ran a bunch of tests.
They told my parents that I'd developed
something called passive schizophrenia.
They gave me a bunch of pills and,
you know, the pills stopped the visions...
...but they pretty much
stopped everything else also...
...so I had this choice.
I was either gonna live my life
with these hallucinations...
...with apparently no way
of switching it off.
Or I could have no life at all.
Oh, my God.
See, there, now I've been
neglecting my duties.
Could I ask you a question?
You know, these are probably
ready to go in.
George?
Would it be okay if I told you
the answer was no?
You don't even know
what I was gonna ask.
Yes, I do. You're gonna ask me
if I can do a reading for you.
Look, Melanie, I barely know you...
...but I like you a lot.
Really, a lot.
Is there any way we could pretend
that maybe we go back in time...
...and just forget about the phone ringing,
and my brother's message...
- ...and we never had this conversation?
- Why?
If we open the door
and go down that road...
...any chance that we had of having
something normal will just be gone.
It just will.
Believe me. I have enough
experience of that now.
I mean, sometimes, I mean....
You know, knowing everything
about someone, it's--
You know, it seems nice, but, really...
...maybe it's actually better
to hold stuff back.
I hear you.
But you can understand. I'm curious.
No, of course. I mean, yeah. Yeah.
please?
Okay.
Come on.
Here, take a seat.
Okay.
I'm gonna take your hands for a second,
to get a connection...
...and then I'll let go, and I'll just
ask you a couple questions.
All right.
Okay. Give me your hands.
Okay.
Okay.
There's a woman. And she's tall.
Thin. She has brown hair.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Is this woman your mother?
Yes.
And I'm feeling a pain in my chest.
Yeah. That's how she died.
Of a heart attack.
I'm sorry.
Okay. You ready to eat?
There's not something else?
- No, there's nothing--
- No, no, no, I can tell.
please, there is, I can tell.
I mean, what's the matter?
You don't think I could handle it?
All right, um....
When you touched me before,
there was a....
There was a man.
Dark hair.
My father.
He passed away not too long ago?
- Last year.
- And....
All he kept saying,
all I kept hearing was--
Was what?
How sorry he was.
What for?
For what he did to you all that time ago.
And he hoped
that you could one day forgive him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
...for pressing you like that.
Maybe we shouldn't have gone there.
I don't know what to say.
Except if I....
If I go now...
...if we draw a line under this...
...pretend it never happened...
...we'll be okay.
I'm sure.
Good.
Good.
We still have the competition
to win. Right?
Right.
I should've listened to you.
You know, too much knowledge
and all that.
I'll see you next week.
Yeah, you betcha.
MAN The old, unhappy
feeling that had once pervaded my life...
...came back like an unwelcome visitor,
and deeper than ever.
It addressed me like a strain
of sorrowful music...
...a hopeless consciousness
of all that I had lost...
...all that I had ever loved.
And all that remained
was a ruined blank and waste...
...lying around me,
unbroken to the dark horizon.
All right, son, out you get.
All right. Lovely, thanks.
- Hello.
- Hi, Marcus!
Hi. I'm Angela. This is Dennis.
All right, mate?
I call him Dennis the Menace.
Now, I'll show you the kitchen.
Just keep walking through there.
So this is where we eat
our breakfast in the morning.
What do you like to eat in the mornings?
We're porridge eaters in this house.
Do you like porridge?
Or cornflakes?
This is your room.
Our last boy, Ricky, moved out
about a month ago.
Just turned 18.
Got his first job, security guard.
Go on, mate. It's all yours now.
Do you
think it's possible to get another bed?
Two secs, Marcus.
We're gonna need another bed.
Upstairs? Should I take yours?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Good night, Jase.
Who agrees? A and D. "Rowan is an
old Roman word for a mountain ash."
"A mountain ash lives over 100 years."
And does anybody else
think it's anything else?
Marcus, could you take
the hat off, please?
Thank you.
So now let's move on to number six.
On the next page.
So you're gonna need to look
at the extract, "Wings of Courage."
- Thank you very much for coming in.
- You're welcome.
And....
We'll be in touch
when we've made the appointment.
Yeah. Okay, great.
Let's get it sorted as soon as possible.
Thanks.
All right, Marcus? See you soon, mate.
Be a good little man.
It's lunchtime, Marcus. You gonna go?
The angel of death comes to you...
...and will find you,
no matter where you are hiding.
Even if you are hiding in,
like a rich man in a castle...
...the angel of God will find you.
Hello.
A number of us are probably
too frightened to ask:
"What happens to us when we die?"
But the good news is, if you believe
in Christ, you have nothing to fear.
Excuse me. I don't understand.
Ah. What wouldn't we give to know
exactly where she's gone?
But from what you wrote in your letter,
perhaps you know already.
- Claudia Rousseau.
- Marie Lelay.
- I'm so happy to meet you.
- You too.
You know, I really need to talk
about the vision I had.
- Sure, go ahead.
- Yeah.
It was a very peaceful sensation.
Everything was quiet.
Darkness everywhere.
And a light was catching my eyes.
And I was hearing the sound
of a gentle wind.
Mm-hm.
A feeling of weightlessness?
Yes.
A 360 perspective?
No sense of linear time or motion?
Yes.
But all-knowing, all-sensing?
Exactly.
- Would you care for some tea?
- Thank you.
You know, as a scientist and atheist...
...my mind was closed to such things.
Oh, absolutely.
Afterlife, near-death experiences.
Like everyone else,
I thought people saw bright lights...
...Eden-like gardens and so forth...
...because they were
culturally conditioned to do so.
But after 25 years in a hospice...
...working with people,
many of whom were pronounced dead...
...but then miraculously survived...
...the account of what they actually
experienced were so strikingly similar...
...it couldn't just be coincidence.
And add to that the fact that when
they had these experiences...
...they were almost all unconscious...
...a state in which my enemies agree
the brain cannot create fresh images.
So you think I really did
experience something?
Oh, yes.
I think you experienced death.
It's all here.
I'm afraid if your journey is anything
like mine, it won't be an easy one.
It's a lonely field to plow.
people get quite irrational around
this subject. Quite hostile, even.
But the evidence is irrefutable.
I tried.
You know, perhaps someone like you...
...in your position, and with your influence,
can change that.
I hope you can.
Thank you.
Good luck.
I'll send it back when I'm done.
Good evening.
Following a joint statement by Vivendi
and electricity giant VFM..
...announcing higher than expected
quarterly profits..
...we wonder if evoking France's economic
downturn might be premature?
Like to see you upstairs.
George, have a seat.
You're probably aware there's been a lot
of talk about cutbacks.
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah. Anyway, seems the suits
got together with the unions...
...and came up with packages for anyone
willing to consider voluntary redundancy.
Voluntary redundancy?
Look, if you ask me,
the deal is pretty good.
You get six months' pay in your pocket
with health insurance for two years.
So, what does this have to do with me?
It's a freaking scandal.
You worked there three years?
You never missed a day,
never called in sick.
- He said it was nothing personal.
- That's B.S.
He's trying to protect the guys
who have wives and kids.
- You should hire a lawyer.
- I can't afford a lawyer.
If you need help getting another job,
I'll help you with that.
I'll make calls. I'll make it happen. But you
know what I think you should do, right?
Yes, I do.
You know, the website's still up.
Waiting.
It'd be different this time, George.
We could control it.
That's how it would be different.
We'd only do two clients a day,
three, tops. Keep it small.
Don't give out your phone number.
We won't talk to the media.
We learned our lesson
with that the last time, right?
Just think about it, all right?
- Doing all right, George?
- Yeah.
Look a little bummed out.
Listen, I'll step in and partner with you.
Me and you could win this thing,
you know?
- Why not?
- Yeah.
Great.
Watch your fingers there.
- Hello?
- Clare?
Dennis. I think you should come over.
Yeah, of course, Dennis. I'll come now.
- How much was in here?
- Two hundred pounds.
We called the school. He never got there.
What happens now?
Well, we don't want to
involve the police.
No, that's really a last resort.
Will you let us know if he comes back?
We will be in touch.
I'll see you out.
There you go.
I'm afraid our sensitive,
Mr. Hewitt, is very busy.
Earliest he could see you
is six weeks' time.
Oh, dear.
Mrs. Joyce, our senior sensitive...
...is doing a public reading tonight
if you're interested.
In the lecture hall.
All right. I'll try my luck. Thank you.
Can I help you?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm getting a strong feeling
over this side of the room.
Someone whose name starts with a "J."
Does the letter "J" mean anything
to anyone? Anyone?
Anyone?
Oh.
Don't be shy.
Tell us your name, please.
Marcus.
Marcus. Marcus. Come on.
Come up here where I can see you.
Good boy.
There's a good boy, Marcus.
That's right. I'm not going to hurt you.
That's lovely.
Now, Marcus,
you've lost someone recently.
Was it someone very close to you?
He's telling me his name.
It's Joe, or Jack.
- Jason.
- Jason, that's it.
He was very close to you, wasn't he?
Was he part of your family?
Is it your dad?
Well, Daddy says please don't be sad...
...and to look after Mummy
for him, will you?
Will you do that for him?
Give Marcus a round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.
Lovely boy.
And as I go into a trance...
...my spirit guide will speak to you
through me.
Oh.
Who summons me from the spirit world?
Say your name.
- Marcus.
- Marcus.
Welcome, Marcus. My name is Yoshi.
What I'm doing is I'm adjusting
the level of the microphones.
Do you do physics at school?
Good. Then you know that all matter
vibrates at different speeds.
But in the spirit world,
operates at far higher levels.
So we can't hear them.
Not with our normal hearing.
So, what we really need
is an omnidirectional...
...supercardioid condenser microphone.
Like this beauty.
Right. I think we are ready.
And....
Jason? Are you there?
Your brother, Marcus, is here.
Is there a message for him?
It was the ancient Greeks
who first discovered it.
"psychomanteum," they called it.
The reflective surface
being the conduit to the afterlife.
Nowadays, we call it "mirror gazing."
You might not be able to speak to him,
but you will see him...
...if you really want to, that is.
Did you see him?
No.
Hello. Clare speaking.
There's no sign of him.
I'm gonna call the police.
- But that will not help.
- Well, I don't care what--
Hang on. He's here.
I'll call you right back.
I'm sorry.
Ah--
Leave him be.
Watch out!
Excuse me.
Sorry, we are running a little late.
Come in.
Everyone is upset by the events.
Sit down.
Marie, to be honest with you,
I'm a bit confused.
I thought we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.
Instead, you give us
the first three chapters of...
...Hereafter:
The Conspiracy of Silence.
I realize it's not
what you were expecting.
You always said there weren't
enough surprises in publishing.
Well, this is certainly a surprise!
I don't know where to begin.
Did you at least find it interesting?
Of course.
You've always had a nose for a good story.
But we're a political publisher--
This is political!
This kind of material, however fascinating,
is for a specialized market.
This morning, in London,
six bombs went off in the heart of the city.
Apparently coordinated, the bombs
exploded at the height of the rush hour.
Why are you all against this?
Why are you so afraid of this?
This is real!
This is scientific evidence...
...from well-known researchers
forced to work in secret.
A Nobel prize winner, hounded
by the religious lobby. That's a story!
Better than a philandering,
dishonest old politician.
But a book like that would probably
have to be written in English...
...for the American market.
It happened to me, Michel.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Where we're going.
What we'll experience.
Each and every one of us.
That doesn't interest you?
Now listen, we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.
Either we agree on this
and you start writing it...
...or else I want my money back.
That's all I can say.
It was so humiliating.
They looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.
Six months ago they begged me
to write about anything.
Anything by the great Marie Lelay.
You'd better give me my job back.
I've had enough with being humiliated.
Today, they even took down my posters.
Why didn't you tell me?
And your book?
I'll finish it in my spare time.
It's caused me enough trouble as it is.
What's the matter?
Look...
...getting your job back...
...might not be as easy as you think.
Why?
It was a temporary break.
And on your advice.
I know, but--
What we couldn't have foreseen is...
...you'd be talking in public
about these experiences.
- That you'd lose your credibility.
- But I didn't want to write this book!
It was your idea!
It was my idea you should write
about Mitterrand.
So, what are you saying?
I'm saying take some more time.
Finish the book, get it out
of your system, then come back.
It's that girl, isn't it?
My replacement?
I've watched her a few times.
She's good.
Yes, she is.
But not as good as you.
You're sleeping with her?
How can you say such a thing?
You always told me to ask
the tough questions.
It's funny....
Who'd have thought it?
A few months ago I was famous.
Rich.
A success story.
I was happy.
Fulfilled by my work.
By you.
All this happened because
you didn't buy your kids their gifts.
Because of what?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.
Forget it. It doesn't matter.
It's Michel.
Listen....
I feel terrible about our meeting
earlier today.
This book is obviously
very important to you.
I think everyone was a bit on edge
because of the events in London.
But I made a few calls. There are
two publishers who might be interested.
One American, one English.
Do you have a pen?
I'm listening.
Anyways, I thought this would be
a good group reading room.
Group reading?
Yeah, where you could
read more people at once.
Up to 20 people or more, it's up to you.
They'd pay lower rates that way.
This would be your personal
consulting room.
And right next door, George,
this is gonna be my room.
I'm gonna make sure
everything gets taken care of.
You won't have to worry.
I don't understand.
What about your other businesses?
Oh, yeah, of course. They're gone.
Once this thing takes off,
forget it, you know?
Let's get you home. You need rest.
You got a big day tomorrow.
You already have three appointments.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Come on.
- You Billy Lonegan?
- Yes.
Before he went, your brother
asked me to give this to you.
Went? Went where?
I have no idea.
Dear Billy...
...I'm sorry.
I guess there's nothing I'll ever
be able to say to persuade you...
...that what I have isn't a gift,
but a curse.
I know you feel what I have
comes with a duty to help others
But right now, the person
I most need to help is myself.
So I've decided to take some time out.
I don't know what the future will bring
or when I'll be back.
So don't wait up, so to speak.
Love to Jenni and the kids
Your baby brother, George.
You know the recovery rate
in substance abuse cases like this.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Very low.
So, what's the best way forward?
Are you okay for a little bit longer?
Yes. But not too long, please.
We're running out of ideas,
and it's beginning to take its toll.
Taking him to see
our previous child, Ricky.
Who knows, you know?
One kid talking to another.
- Marie Lelay?
- Yes?
This is Richard Aronson
of Aquarius Books in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Excuse me?
Aquarius books in Santa Fe?
A few months ago, you sent us your book.
I'm just ringing to say
how much we liked it.
Sorry it's taken so long, but we loved it,
and we'd like to publish it.
- Really?
- In fact, we'd like to print it...
...in time for a book fair in London
in the spring.
- You're based in Paris?
- Yes
So, if we were to ask
going to London wouldn't be inconvenient?
No. No, no, no, not at all.
That would be a good opportunity
to do some publicity.
Maybe a reading. It's an incredible story.
Thank you.
And here we are.
48 Doughty Street.
Charles Dickens' home in London...
...where he lived with his wife Catherine
and their children.
Anyone know how many children?
Here we are in the main hallway.
- This is the view that greeted the author...
- Ten.
...as he walked in each time.
Everything has been preserved
exactly as it was.
So just follow me up the stairs.
We'll start at the top of the house.
Now we move in to Dickens' study.
And directly in front of you, you'll see
an original copy of A Christmas Carol...
...arguably one of Dickens'
most famous books.
But over here, the thing I expect
most of you have come to see.
Dickens' desk,
where he wrote most of his books.
On this wall we have several illustrations
for The Mystery of Edwin Drood...
...the novel Dickens was writing
at the time of his death.
And on the far wall here,
a painting loved by Dickens fans.
It shows the author asleep at his desk...
...with characters from his novels
floating in the air around him.
Anyone know its name?
Dickens' Dream.
It's called Dickens' Dream.
This way, please.
Just gather again at the front
of the building.
Does anyone have any questions?
What is the date today?
- Fourteenth.
- It is the 14th. Yeah, okay.
I think you'll like Ricky.
He was about your age when he first
came to us, and just as shy.
Now he's a grown man.
With a job and his own flat.
- He's in here somewhere.
- He said he'd meet us at the front.
Where is he?
- Where is he?
- Hey. Look at this.
- Hey.
- Heh, heh, heh.
Oh, my God, I hardly recognized you.
- You gonna arrest us?
- Yeah. Not if you behave yourself.
Marcus, this is Ricky.
You all right, mate?
Fancy a coffee first?
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- Yeah, great idea.
It's an amazing place, isn't it?
Can I have a look around?
Yeah. But meet us back here
in one hour, yeah?
- Good lad.
- Okay?
It's been nearly a year.
He hardly speaks to us.
Neither did I, remember?
This one's different. He's not like you.
- Let's have that coffee, yeah?
- Yeah.
Oh, lovely.
"'She is,
I do assure you, the winegariest person.'
Mr. plornish, with a modest
disavowal of his merits...
...opened the room door
for her readmission...
...and followed her in with such
an exceedingly bald presence...
...of not having been out at all...
...that her father might have observed it
without being very suspicious.
In his affable unconsciousness,
however, he took no heed.
plornish, after the little conversation,
took his leave.
Making the tour of the prison
before he left...
...and looking on at a game of skittles...
...with the mixed feelings
of an old inhabitant...
...who had his private reasons
for believing...
...that it might be his destiny
to come back again."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, if any of you wish to purchase a CD,
I am at your disposal.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi. George.
- To George.
- Yeah. George Lonegan.
To George.
I'm a-- It's-- This is an honor, Mr. Jacobi.
I'm a really big fan. You have no idea.
Thank you.
You're a long way from home.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Did you enjoy it?
- Very much, yes.
- There you are. Thank you.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
"I felt connected to another world...
...a place of utter peace and tranquility.
Whether what I saw was a genuine
glimpse of the afterlife...
...or just a concussed fantasy,
I'll probably never know.
I arrive at the end of my journey
with as many question as I started with.
I certainly never imagined
I would be exposed...
...to that kind of prejudice
and close-mindedness.
We obviously still have
a long way to go...
...before we will be able to deal
with death and what follows...
...in anything approaching
a sensible fashion."
Okay, so if you want to buy my book,
I can sign it.
You're welcome. Thank you.
- Hello. What's your name?
- Hello.
- Maria.
- Maria.
- Thank you, Maria.
- Thank you very much.
- Michael.
- Michael. Okay.
Thank you.
Honora.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- My name's George.
- George.
- To penny.
- Sorry?
- penny.
- penny.
Wait a minute. I recognize you.
Sorry?
You're that psychic.
No, no. Um.... No, you got me mistaken
with someone else.
Yes, you are. You're George Lonegan.
- I don't even know who that is. No, I'm not.
- You are George Lonegan.
- You got me--
- I need to talk to you.
No, you got me mixed up
with someone else.
please, I need to talk to you.
You're a psychic.
I'm not. I'm not who you think I am.
I saw it on the Internet.
You are a psychic.
What? What is it? What do you want?
If it's a reading, I have news for you.
I don't do it anymore.
Now leave me alone.
"When I look back on this, it was insane.
The rudder cables became useless
and I lost my ability to steer.
I was helpless amid the swirling
maritime mass of industry.
The sea had turned malevolently dark.
What had once seemed friendly was now
a violent monster trying to kill me."
Did you see a Frenchwoman who was
here just a few minutes ago?
She's gone. She left already.
"You realize you're in danger...
...and dwell on how things might end.
I spent every second...."
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone.
Come on, please. Move along.
Hill cuts it back nicely,
perhaps almost too far.
But it's gone in! It's gone in!
Andy Fisher!
You have to question that play....
Okay.
We better get you inside.
Come on.
- What's your name?
- Marcus.
Okay. Couple of ground rules
before we get started.
I'm sorry about the woman.
What woman?
The woman at the book fair.
I could tell you liked her.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
So I'm sorry for taking you away.
I don't have any idea what you're
talking about. Here, sit down.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Okay, I'm gonna grab your hands
because it seems to help...
...and then I'll let go.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna go into
any stupid trance or anything like that.
I just gotta grab them to get a connection,
then I'll let go. Okay?
Now, I want you to answer yes or no
to everything I ask.
- You understand?
- Yes.
Okay.
Let's see them.
Okay.
Okay, someone close to you
has passed away?
Yes.
A male?
Yes.
He was young when he died.
Yes.
This person your brother?
Older brother.
But not by much, he says.
Only by a few minutes.
I'm sorry, kid.
I gotta concentrate.
This guy.... This guy talks a lot.
Talks fast.
Got a really weird laugh.
Okay. Ahem. He says...
...there's so much he wants to tell you.
You wouldn't believe how it is.
How you can be all things...
...and all at once.
And the weightlessness.
He says that's cool.
Now he's laughing.
He's got a funny laugh.
Um....
Okay.
He says how you
always looked up to him...
...and relied on him
to make the decision...
...how maybe you used that
as an excuse.
Is that true?
Okay. He says can't do that anymore.
Now you're on your own.
Okay, now, hang on, okay, now.
Now he's saying something about a hat.
The cap?
A cap. Okay.
He says to take it off right now.
Take it off.
He doesn't--
He's telling you not to wear it again...
...because it was his.
And that's why he knocked it off
your head that day?
At the tube? Do you know
what he's talking about?
Okay.
He says good thing he did too.
And that's the last time
he's ever looking out for you.
I'm sorry. I'm, uh....
I'm sorry, I'm losing him now.
He's leaving. He wants to leave.
No, Jase.
Don't go.
You can't. Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be here without you.
please, Jase, don't go. I miss you.
Okay, he came back. He's here. He says...
...if you're worried about being
on your own, don't be.
You're not.
Because he is you and you are him.
One cell.
One person.
Always.
I miss you.
please, Jase, don't go.
please come back.
I miss you so badly.
Okay, wait. He's leaving again.
Hold on, hold on. I'm sorry.
Well, where's he gone?
I'm sorry, kid. I don't know.
But you've done all those readings.
I still don't know.
Sorry.
Okay. We better get you home.
- Hello?
- May Fair.
What?
The hotel where she's staying.
The woman you like?
What are you talking about?
Well, I rang up the publisher
and said I heard her speak...
...wanted to drop off a letter
saying how interesting it was.
Anyway, that's the name.
May Fair.
Okay, well, that's really interesting,
but what does that have to do with me?
Hello?
Well, I'll be.
I must be crazy.
Morning, sir.
Okay.
- Here's your room key. Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm looking for a guest. Marie Lelay?
Okay. Okay.
No, there's no answer from the room,
I'm afraid, sir.
Would you like to leave a message?
No.
Actually, you know what? I would, I would.
Do you have a pen and paper?
Sure.
- pen, paper.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
This is it.
Marcus? Good luck.
Come here.
I missed you so much.
Oh, Marcus.
Come here. I missed you so much.
Marie?
