<i>The trial of kingpin Lou Janero ended today.
Samantha Walker has the story.</i>
<i>After four days of deliberation...</i>
<i>the jury has found Lou Janero guilty
of murdering Paul Cirela.</i>
<i>Cirela, part of Janero's organization,
was set to testify against Janero...</i>
<i>in an upcoming trial on charges of
bookmaking and tax evasion.</i>
<i>Assistant DA Thomas McSherry
credited Inspector Harry Callahan...</i>

prosecution of Lou Janero.</i>
<i>I 'd say</i> a <i>great deal of credit should go

<i>He put Lou Janero out of business.</i>

<i>I'm Samantha Walker for Channel 8.
Back to you.</i>
Get off my ass.
He's going.
Did you recognize
any of the attackers?
Does this attack have anything to do
with the Janero trial?
Has Janero put out a Contract on you
because of your testimony?
- Were these men employed by Janero?
- Have you received any death threats?
Has the department offered to
provide you with more protection?
Hold it. The department will issue
a complete Statement...
as soon as we've conducted
our own investigation.
$13,453.63.
That's how much an unmarked squad car
costs this department.
That's the third goddamn car
you trashed this month.
- Lou Janero.
- What?
His men shot up the car.
Send him the bill.
Very funny, Harry.
See how funny it is behind a desk.
You're off the street,
effective immediately.
- All this for a frigging car?
- At Lieutenant Ackerman's request.
With the chief's approval.
It's for your own good.
- If you think I'm gonna shuffle papers...
- Just until we can handle Janero.
He may be in prison, but it's clear
he's calling the shots. Literally.
And our newest hero can't be turned into
Swiss cheese before the commendation.
There, you see?
You're getting a commendation.
Swell.
It's time we took advantage
of the press you've been getting.
How do you propose
to do that, lieutenant?
It's my opinion that you'd be serving best
by working with me in Public Relations.
Well, opinions are like assholes.
Everybody has one.
I don't think you realize what you've done
for the department's image.
I mean, you just put a major
crime figure in prison.
You've got a high visibility right now.
- Al.
- Harry.
And for once, it's positive.
You know what that means
in terms of recruitment?
I mean, look at this.
Look at this copy we're getting.
My God, we've never been this swamped
with interview requests.
I'm not some dog-and-pony act.
It's important that we maximize
your public-relations value while we can.
I don't feel like getting close and
personal with reporters. That's not my job.
Your job is to promote
the department's positive image.
How positive would the image be
if I resigned, lieutenant?
Don't misunderstand me.
Harry, all I'm asking for
is a little cooperation.
All right. I guess we don't have to
pull you off the street completely.
- Just be more cooperative with the press.
- Anything else?
Yeah.
Quan, will you come in here
for a minute?
Quan's moving over from
Youth Gang Task Force to Homicide.
Good, Homicide can always use a cop
with AI's experience.
I'm glad you agree.
Because if you wanna stay on the street,
you take Quan to watch your back.
- Now hold on...
- That's final.
That's just swell, being as that most of
my partners end up in the hospital or dead.
Ask AI how he feels about all that.
What about it, Quan?
Any objections to working with Callahan?
I think I can handle it.
Get a bulletproof vest, kid.
Teaming Callahan with a Chinese-American
would be very good for our image.
- You have any kids, lieutenant?
- Me? No.
Lucky for them.
Cut. Cut!
You're out of sync, Johnny.
What's the problem here, love?
Where is that...? Where is that fool?
Jeff!
Jeff!
We've had a short, Peter.
You said you had the bugs worked out.
"Trust me," you said.
- Isn't that what he said?
- "Trust me."
Know how they say "fuck you"
in this business? "Trust me!"
I checked it. I've got a backup head.
Just give me 20 minutes, we'll be ready.
All right, do it.
And no more cock-ups this time.
And that goes for the rest
of you incompetent morons. Come on!
This sucks, man.
How can I sing with shit
exploding all over the place?
- It was just an accident, Johnny.
- This whole movie is an accident.
How the fuck did I get
talked into this shit?
You needed a music video
and I needed a Sequence for the film.
Stop complaining.
We're both getting what we want.
Well, why can't we shoot on a warm
sound stage, instead of a meat locker?
I need it cold so the audience can see
your breath when you sing. It's an effect.
Brilliant.
It won't be original, but at least
the audience will know I froze my ass off.
What the hell does that mean?
It means a director with talent would have
the guts to shoot something original...
instead of ripping off
old movies like The Exorcist.
This is not a rip-off,
it's a homage. You stupid...
Jesus, I don't believe you.
What?
You're hurting, aren't you?
I don't know what you're saying.
Don't give me that shit.
You promised not during shooting.
I know what I'm doing.
I know what I'm doing. I can handle it.
- You will not fuck up my film!
- I said, I can handle it!
Just let me go back to the trailer
and get it together.
Then we'll kick some ass.
- Okay?
- Okay_.
- Can I get a coat?
- Get a coat, please, for Johnny.
- Now what do we do?
- Don't worry, Johnny's like a trained Seal.
Throw him a fish, he'll perform.
Come on.
Rise and shine, boys.
Time to get up.
What's happening?
I always knew that working Homicide
would be glamorous.
I mean, meeting celebrities and all.
Well, too bad you can't
get his autograph.
You know, Harry,
they always die in threes.
Haven't you noticed? When a celebrity dies,
two more always go in a week or two.
It's a fact, Harry.
Celebrities always die in threes.
Well, this one's got crystalline powder
around his nose and mouth.
Scabs up and down both arms.
Fresh puncture marks
on his left forearm.
Yeah, Homicide can be
really glamorous.
Check the dummy out, please.
Meagan.
I want a three-inch lens, very tight.
Try not to drop it.
Let's hurry up and shoot this
and wrap this up, please.
And my second assistant and I
found Johnny in his trailer.
He was just lying there.
At first we thought it was a joke.
- But then, well...
- When did you last see him alive?
About half an hour before that.
He went back to his trailer
while we set up for another take.
Was he alone?
I don't know,
but he was alone when we found him.
Tell me, does anyone
on your set use drugs?
We don't do drugs, Callahan.
We do film.
Look, Callahan,
what people do is their own business.
As long as it doesn't interfere with
my film, I really don't give a shit.
- What about Squares, was he using?
- How should I know?
Johnny had agents, lawyers, friends.
If he had a drug problem, it was
their job to take care of it, not mine.
Well, that's a very caring attitude.
What do you want from me, Callahan?
Drugs were Johnny's trademark.
He made his career singing about them.
It made him controversial.
I can see why you'd want him
in your flick.
It was purely a marketing decision.
Johnny Squares sells tickets.
You know, burns on seats, love.
Besides, we needed a music video tie-in.
You have any idea
who was supplying him?
No, but if I hear of anything,
you'll be the first one I call.
Marvelous.
Make a note to check on anyone
who dealt with Squares.
- Whether it's his cast, crew...
- Inspector Callahan.
Inspector.
Shit.
We just had word Johnny Squares OD'd,
is that true?
We're in the process of
conducting an investigation.
Right as we speak, this moment.
Nothing's been determ...
Thank you, inspector.
- Excuse me, are you Suzanne Dayton?
- What's going on here?
Johnny?
Johnny?
Hold it. I'm sorry, step back.
- No, Johnny!
- There's nothing they can do now.
Johnny! Oh, my God!
You'll make yourself sick. Calm down.
Hold on a second,
could we give her a little air?
Can you step out of the way, please?
No! NO!
- Off with that camera.
- I'll film what I want. Keep shooting.
This is someone else's heartache.
Right in here.
What are you doing? Give me that.
Smart.
High <i>and Dry is the kind of
mindless film Comedy...</i>
<i>that's come to typify summer films
aimed at the youth market.</i>
<i>The humor, what little there is,
is of the locker-room variety.</i>
<i>Audiences seeking more sophistication
will have to look elsewhere.</i>
<i>The producers...</i>
<i>Rock star Johnny Squares
was found dead this afternoon.</i>
<i>Samantha Walker filed this report.</i>
<i>The body of Johnny Squares was
discovered at the Royal Meat Company...</i>
<i>where he was on location
filming the movie</i> Hotel <i>Satan.</i>
<i>Lnvestigators wouldn't comment
on the cause of death...</i>
<i>but Squares had</i> a <i>long history
of drug use.</i>
<i>The rock star was arrested last July
for possession of heroin.</i>
<i>Many of his songs were allegedly
based on his drug experience.</i>
- What's that all about?
- It's my past catching up with me.
When I was a kid, I was in the gang
that hit him up for protection money.
All my life I've been involved with gangs.
With them, or trying to put them away.
So I figured I'd come over to Homicide.
It was time for something different.
It's different, all right.
Call for backup.
Come on. Get the fuck out of here.
Hurry up!
Come on, hurry!
Move it! Move it!
Put your money on the table!
Hurry up!
Don't move!
Don't fuck with me, lady! Okay.
Come on, you guys, hurry UP!
- You forgot your fortune cookie.
- What?!
Itsays:
"You're shit out of luck."
Get out of the way!
I think teaming up with a Chinese-American
is good for the department's image.
Stay behind the lines. Hey!
I'm not gonna tell you again.
- Coming through here.
- All right. Heads up, please.
Who was he?
Some poor guy in the wrong place at the
wrong time. Dean Madison was his name.
Does it ring a bell?
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he knew you, Harry.
I found this in his pocket.
It's a list of celebrities.
Tony Engelhart, the pro linebacker.
Michael Cipriano, the race car driver.
And one Inspector Harry Callahan.
Johnny Squares is also on that list.
You see what's written beside his name?
Yeah, "R.I.P." "Rest in peace."
You know what this is?
It's a bill for a TV camera and lens.
When I said stop wrecking our cars,
I didn't mean destroy something else.
They were interfering
with an official investigation.
Don't give us that.
Is this your idea of media cooperation?
Cooperation works two ways, lieutenant.
Just what is it you have
against reporters?
Some of them
are just marvelous people.
But some walk through a pile and track it
through an investigation. I don't like that.
Well, you better
change your attitude fast.
Because unless we
reach an agreement with them...
it's liable to cost this city
2 million dollars, and your career.
Would you join us, please?
This is Ms. Samantha Walker
of station KWSF. Captain Donnelly.
- Ms. Walker.
- Captain.
- And this is Inspector...
- Callahan. Yes, we've met.
- Yes, of course. Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Ms. Walker...
Lieutenant Ackerman here tells me
you have a proposal to make...
regarding the accidental
damage to a...
There was nothing accidental
about it, captain.
Well, I think the department might
have something to say about it.
Although the camera itself was destroyed,
I have the entire incident on video.
I see.
And your proposal?
We may be willing to drop
the lawsuit against the city...
but that all depends
on Inspector Callahan.
- The inspector would be willing to...
- Just what do you have in mind?
Dinner.
I owe you an apology.
You were right about what I did
the other day.
I had no business intruding
on that girl's grief.
I get a little too eager sometimes.
In my rush to get the story first,
I made an error.
- We all make those from time to time.
- No, I should have known better.
I'm sorry.
- Let me ask you something, Miss Walker...
- Sam.
Sam. Do you like cops?
As long as they're not
in my rear-view mirror. Why?
I wondered what we're talking about here,
other than the damage to the camera.
Oh, no, no.
I'm willing to let the insurance company
deal with that.
And I think I can be persuaded
to drop the lawsuit...
- ...but I want something in return.
- Oh?
- What would that be?
- I want your story.
- What do you have there?
- I've done my homework on you.
You've had quite a colorful career.
Look at this. You see...
there's a lot of interest right now
in the Janero case...
and in the cop that put him in prison.
So Channel 8 is doing a series of specials
on organized crime in the Bay Area.
But what <i>I</i> would like to do
is an in-depth profile...
- ...of you, Inspector Harry Callahan.
- Sorry, I'm not interested.
But why not? This latest attempt
on your life by one of Janero's men...
You're not interested
in doing a story on me.
All you want is blood.
That's what sells...
- No. Now, wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.
You people are interested
in death and mayhem...
but you don't care
how you get the story.
No, that is not fair.
That is not the kind of journalism I do.
You don't know me.
I'm just a cop with a price on my head.
And let me tell you something, lady.
I don't like people saying they'll kill me.
And I don't like journalists using it
as a way to increase ratings.
- That's what I was asking...
- That's the end of the story.
Sorry.
The coroner's report last night
said that Squares was using speedballs.
- Injecting both cocaine and heroin?
- Only that isn't what killed him.
He was using an inhaler
with some new designer drug.
A synthetic form of heroin.
You mean something along the lines
of China White.
Yeah, only about a thousand times
more powerful.
He took one snort and went into
immediate respiratory failure.
What I'm trying to figure
is why is a guy like that...
screwing around with synthetic junk
when he's got the real stuff?
Maybe he didn't know
what he was using.
Harry.
Harry?
Sorry about that.
Get you next time.
Check the cast and crew
for prior drug busts.
I'll check with Narcotics to see if there's
any dealers moving synthetic heroin.
Harry, there's something here
you ought to see.
<i>The story to be published
in today's Tribune...</i>
<i>reveals that director Peter Swan
and other people closely involved...</i>
<i>in</i> Hotel <i>Satan were playing</i>
a <i>bizarre game called "The Dead Pool."</i>
<i>Sources say
the object of the game...</i>
<i>was to pick
eight Ba y Area celebrities...</i>
<i>who might die, presumably of
natural Causes, by</i> a <i>predetermined date.</i>
<i>The winner was the person whose list
contained the most dead celebrities.</i>
<i>Now, what makes this story Significant...</i>
<i>is that rock star Johnny Squares appeared
on the list of director Peter Swan.</i>
<i>Although Swan would not comment
on these developments...</i>
<i>we have confirmed from another source
that there was such</i> a <i>game...</i>
<i>and Swan's production accountant,
Dean Madison, was also involved.</i>
<i>Lronically,
Madison was killed yesterday...</i>
<i>in</i> a <i>tragic holdup attempt
that took place in Chinatown.</i>
There is no man who is master of
the breath of life so as to retain it...
and none has mastery
over the day of death.
For the Lord of all
shows no partiality...
nor does he fear greatness...
because he himself made the great
as well as the small.
And he provides for all alike.
And the dust returns to
the earth, as it once was.
And the life breath returns to God,
who gaveth.
My condolences.
Mrs. Dayton, I'm terribly sorry.
Suzanne, I'm very sorry.
Thank you.
My sympathies.
Do you mind, gentlemen?
I happen to be at a funeral.
I'd like to talk to you about your list.
It's no big secret.
Most of the cast and crew knew about it.
I didn't tell you because
the Dead Pool is just a harmless game.
It sounds pretty sick to me.
Let me tell you something.
People are fascinated
with death and violence.
That's why my films make money.
They're an escape,
a vicarious release of fear.
Same thing with this game.
Nobody takes my films
or the Dead Pool seriously.
Well, someone gave Squares the drugs
that killed him. Maybe it was you.
You can't tie me into Johnny's death
just because of a coincidence.
My assistant and my effects supervisor
played too. Why not talk to them?
We Will.
But nobody on their list is dead yet.
Johnny was a major drug user and I
predicted he'd die this year. That's all.
The whole idea is to pick celebrities
who won't make it...
because they're old, sick
or in a high-risk profession.
- Like police work?
- Nothing personal, love.
I don't like your list, Swan.
I don't like being on it.
That's what this is really all about,
isn't it?
If you have a choice...
Maybe <i>I'll</i> start my own Dead Pool
and put you on it.
Are you threatening me?
If you want to play the game,
you'd better know the rules, love.
That's our report. I'm Patrick Snow.
I'm Samantha Walker.
We thank you for being with us.
Tune in tonight for a report...
on chemical dependency
among celebrities.
Who they are, why they do it...
and the price they pay.
Tonight at 11.
- Good night.
- Good night.
And we're clear.
Thought I'd seen
the last of you, Callahan.
I saw your report yesterday.
We confirmed it
with two people in the game.
Vicky Owens, Swan's assistant,
and special-effects supervisor Jeff Howser.
I don't suppose it occurred to you
to clear it with us first?
I had to go with the story.
The papers got the same tip. I had the
chance to get the story out faster.
Otherwise someone else
would get it first?
- Something like that.
- How were you tipped?
By mail. A copy of the Dead Pool
and a letter explaining how it worked.
- It's already started, you know.
- What has?
All the media bullshit.
Newspapers print the Dead Pool,
it doesn't help our investigation any.
No, what bothers you...
is that we found out about
the Dead Pool first.
You people take Janero and the Dead Pool,
add the hype and distortion...
innocent people get hurt.
Aren't you overreacting just a bit?
I've seen it happen.
Look, I don't like the hype
any more than you do...
but it happens when reporters
compete for a story.
Why don't you start thinking about
your responsibility to the public?
You can't kill the messenger
because of the message.
Sorry if we Screwed up your investigation.
That was not my intention.
Here's the list. Now, excuse me.
Thanks.
It seems to me I owe you one.
Dinner, that is.
I was offered a job as an anchor
at this small local station because...
I was first runner-up
in Miss Colorado.
- Colorado?
- Yes.
We're right over here.
But I had absolutely no experience,
just my bachelor's in journalism.
But it was a way in, so...
Thank you... I grabbed it.
But I didn't just smile at the camera
and read copy.
I did anything and everything
at the station.
Sports, news, hard news, weather.
I produced three documentaries.
I love San Francisco.
But it isn't easy.
Big city, big news.
I had to prove myself all over again.
Have you succeeded?
Somewhat.
But apparently not with you.
I guess I shouldn't complain.
At least you stayed for dinner this time.
I'd still love to do your story.
No, thanks.
You're wrong about me, Callahan,
and what I want to do.
I wish I could convince you of that.
- I'll tell you what.
- What?
Let's think on it.
Sounds fair.
Thank you.
Yeah, well, it's the truth,
I don't care what you say.
Hey, Callahan.
- You're Callahan, aren't you?
- That's right.
What can I do for you?
You're the cop who
put Janero away, aren't you?
All I want is your autograph.
Can I shake your hand?
I'd just like to thank you.
It's about time Somebody did something
about garbage like Janero.
Could you sign it to
Chester Docksteder? That's me.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Some other time.
You know what we need?
More cops like you. That's what we need.
I gotta change my shorts.
What are you laughing at?
- This is your 15 minutes, Callahan.
- What?
Andy Warhol said everybody's famous
for 15 minutes. Well, this is it.
Swell.
Was this your first autograph?
Yeah.
And I hope my last.
- Watch your step. Here we go.
- Get that squad car out of there.
You know something, Harry?
I don't think Lou Janero
likes you very much.
She's okay. Just a little shaken up.
How're you doing, girl?
Whatever they're paying you, Harry,
it couldn't be enough.
- My colleagues.
- Yeah.
I don't want to be the news.
Let's get you out of here.
You sure you want to see this guy?
Yeah.
Hey, watch the footprints.
Here's your animal.
Hicks.
What the fuck do you want?
I brought you some cigarettes.
And what would I have to do for you?
Nothing. Just stand where I tell you.
Shit. Who the fuck let him out?
Stay right here.
Fifth cell down.
Hey, man, you owe me cigarettes.
That's the trouble with this prison.
They let anybody in here.
I don't like scum like you
trying to kill me, Janero.
Sounds to me like this Dead Pool thing
is making you a little paranoid, Callahan.
Oh, yeah. I heard about it.
Good news travels fast.
Big fucking media hero.
Hero today and gone tomorrow.
Call off your guns now, you hear me?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
The trouble with you is,
you have too much time on your hands.
What you need is a job.
- A what?
- A job.
I'm gonna give you a job
being a postman, understand?
It'll be your job to make sure
the mail gets through.
See that gorilla down there?
That's Butcher Hicks, and he's killed
three men. You know how he did it?
He tore them apart with his teeth.
Didn't even find all the pieces.
You might say he has
an unhealthy appetite.
So what?
So Hicks there is my new pen pal.
I'm gonna send him a letter
once a week...
about how I'm looking in
on his sick mother...
and trying to get him
special privileges here.
And the interesting part is,
if anything happens to me...
and Hicks doesn't get his letter,
he'll be really pissed off.
And he's gonna come and see you
because you're the mailman.
In fact, he'll probably come down here
and Cancel your ass like a stamp.
So you better ensure prompt,
courteous delivery.
And pray nothing happens to me.
- That's it?
- That's it.
You see that dirtbag
I was talking to down there?
He says smoking can cause Cancer...
and anyone who smokes as much
as you do is one dumb son of a bitch.
Fire!
Cut! Cut! Cut.
Where is that stupid fuck? Howser!
Get your ass down here.
The dummy, asshole. You're supposed to
harpoon the goddamn dummy.
- The tide shifted, all right?
- "The tide shifted."
The ocean's incompetent, not you.
- This is the third time this week.
- Peter!
You'll never work
on one of my films again.
There's a bunch
of reporters down there.
Come on, come on.
Can we ask you a few questions?
Please! Please! Please!
I would just like to say one thing.
In light of what's happened...
perhaps playing the Dead Pool game
isn't smart.
Any tie between the Dead Pool
and Squares' death?
None whatsoever. Next question, please.
Mr. Swan, will the game continue?
No, we're filming a nightmare
Sequence at the shipyards...
and we'd like to put this behind us
and get on with ourjob.
Johnny would have wanted it that way.
First Squares died, then your production
accountant was tragically killed.
Is your film Hotel <i>Satan</i> cursed?
People can believe whatever
the hell they want, but nothing...
I repeat, nothing will stop me
from making this film.
End of interview.
Please! Please. Whatever you want,
money, credit cards, just take it.
You ever notice how time seems
to slow down at night?
Just like in my films.
A dream world.
- Please.
- Shut up!
I can't hear the colors.
I've got to hear the colors.
That's the mark of a good director,
you've gotta be able to hear the colors.
You've gotta be able
to taste the sounds.
Please. I have a heart condition.
A critic with a heart.
That's a laugh.
- Do you like my films?
- What?
- I said, do you like my films?
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I don't. I don't know you.
God...
what kind of a film critic are you?
<i>Shadows of the Dead!</i>
<i>Hell Without the Devil!</i>
<i>Night of the Slasher!</i>
Peter Swan.
Brilliant, love.
What do you think of my films?
Give me your honest opinion.
I like them.
Liar!
The entrance was probably
through the sliding glass door.
She wasn't sexually assaulted.
Killed sometime last night.
Maid found her this morning.
Do you recognize her?
- No.
- Molly Fisher. Famous movie critic.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being the best...
I think I'd have to rate this one an 8.
Harry, we found this.
Thanks.
Dead Pool.
Molly Fisher's also
on Peter Swan's list.
<i>Oh, God, it's coming!</i>
<i>Oh, Shit!</i>
Those are just some of the highlights
of Peter Swan's films.
The typeface is the same as the ones
sent to the papers and TV stations.
And the neighbor saw a dark-haired man
exiting Molly Fisher's condo last night.
Mid-30s, wearing a blackjacket.
I want Swan in Custody now.
It just doesn't feel right.
Doesn't feel right?
Every Celebrity on this list must have
called in the last couple days.
They're all screaming
for police protection.
They don't understand we don't have
the manpower to be 24-hour babysitters.
Ackerman is whining about the negative
impact this case is giving our public image.
And your name
is on this list too, Callahan.
Now, my gut feeling tells me Swan is
the best suspect we have...
so get his butt in here!
Donnelly.
What?
Yeah. It's for you, Callahan.
Yeah. Yeah?
Okay, we'll be right there. Let's go.
Wait a minute. What was that?
Where are you going?
To do my job.
I think we've got our man.
You all stay back.
Everyone.
I'm gonna go UP-
Where's the news crew?
You better get them here.
I mean it. Now!
What's up?
His name's Gus Wheeler.
He said he's the Dead Pool Killer,
wants to give up.
We found him like this.
He soaked himself in gasoline
and is threatening to set himself on fire.
Can't Somebody hose him down?
He says if he sees a fireman or even
a garden hose, he'll torch himself.
- What does he want?
- To be on television.
- What?
- He wants a cameraman and a reporter.
That's easy. Al and I will pose as...
No, it has to be someone he recognizes.
Stay back. Stay back from me.
I'm gonna go up. You hear me?
Better keep those people back.
- You all right?
- Not really.
Stop right there! That's far enough.
Mr. Wheeler, I'm Samantha Walker from...
- I know who you are!
- What is it you want?
- Is that camera on?
- Yeah.
You want to know why I'm doing this?
- Because nobody cares.
- We care, Mr. Wheeler...
No! Nobody ever paid
any attention to me before.
In order to get attention,
you gotta do something.
Well, I'm really gonna do something.
I'm really gonna do something this time!
Mr. Wheeler, did you have
anything to do with the deaths...
of Johnny Squares and Molly Fisher?
No, I just said that so you'd listen to me.
I want everyone to see this!
I want everyone to remember me!
And to remember what I did here!
Oh, Jesus, Harry,
he's really gonna do it.
That's right, lady, I'm really gonna do it.
I'm really gonna set myself on fire.
And it's gonna be on the news...
and then finally everybody
will know about me.
About me! Gus Wheeler!
No one's gonna see you die,
Mr. Wheeler.
- What?
- I said, no one's gonna see you die.
Not if we stop filming.
No. No, you can't... This is news!
You can talk to me
and you can tell me your story...
but we won't film your Suicide.
What are you doing?
- Turn that camera back on!
- We're not gonna film it!
- We're not.
- She's right.
You can set yourself into a bonfire,
we'll break out marshmallows and weenies.
But you won't be on News at 11.
You're ruining everything.
Give me the flare.
You've got plenty of Coverage already.
You think so?
Trust me.
<i>Okay-</i>
Harry!
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Harry, you okay?
- You hurt?
- No, I'm fine.
Get that gurney over here, quick!
- You all right?
- Oh, God, Harry.
This man sets himself on fire.
- And it's my fault.
- It was an accident.
- Thanks.
- Maybe if we would've kept filming.
That's exactly what he wanted.
What you did in there took guts.
Most everyone else would have
gone for the exclusive.
Reel three, George.
Just a moment.
What is this? Why the fuck
are you people harassing me?
I was at a party the night
Fisher was killed.
I was there until 2 or 2:30.
Plenty of people can back me up.
We know that. We checked.
Somebody's trying to set you up.
They're trying to make us think
that you killed Squares and Fisher.
- Any idea of who it could be?
- Are you kidding? It could be anyone.
They all hate me. My former agent.
My producers of my last film.
My crew. The public.
It's jealousy. They envy my talent so much
they wish to destroy it.
You don't believe me?
You talk to my secretary.
She'll show you the letters I get.
Warnings, death threats...
I get so many,
I don't even pay attention anymore.
I'll check on it.
Tell me...
anyone else have
a jacket like this one?
Most of my crew. Why?
Maybe it was someone in your crew,
or Who's worked for you in the past.
Whoever's pulling off these murders is
using your films and you as inspiration.
<i>Welcome to the</i> Nolan <i>Kennard Show.
Sex, violence, pornography:</i>
<i>I say it's getting out of hand. It's time
we have guidelines for what we watch.</i>
<i>I don't want Big Brother out there
telling me what to read or watch.</i>
<i>- What's your opinion?
- Anybody can watch anything they want...</i>
<i>as long as it doesn't
hurt Somebody else.</i>
<i>Take it easy.</i>
<i>Give me</i> a <i>chance.
Give me</i> a <i>chance here.</i>
<i>The problem is,
who decides what's harmful?</i>
<i>Lsn 't that what we 're talking about here?</i>
First Johnny Squares,
then Molly Fisher, now Nolan Kennard.
It's like I was telling you,
celebrities always die...
In threes, yeah.
- At least the guy went out with a...
- A bang, yeah, I know.
- What do you have, Russ?
- Hello, Harry.
From the residue on the frags,
I'd say plastic. Probably C3 or 4.
We'll do an analysis back at the lab.
- Let me know what you find out.
- You got it.
What's that?
I don't know.
It looks like the wheel from a toy
or something.
Have police questioned you about
Nolan Kennard?
Is his death connected
to the Dead Pool?
- I don't know.
- Is his death due to your list?
<i>- I don't know.
- In Hell Without the Devil...</i>
a character is poisoned.
<i>Night</i> of the Slasher has several stabbings.
- We can guess what Hotel Satan...
- Get to the point, love.
Are there parallels between the deaths
in your film...
- ...and the death of Johnny Squares?
- That's a stupid question!
- Do you feel any responsibility?
- You're blowing this out of proportion.
<i>You want to speak to Somebody?
Speak to the police.</i>
<i>Talk to Inspector Callahan.
He'll tell you I'm not</i> a <i>suspect.</i>
<i>I have nothing
to do with these deaths.</i>
<i>That's all I have to say, now sod off.</i>
Callahan!
You.
Harry.
I think that's about it for me.
What's that tattoo?
Oh, that.
It's one of my grandfather's
superstitions.
You see, he painted these words
on my back and chest.
It's supposed to ward off
anything that's harmful or evil.
When he heard I was your partner,
he figured I could use the help.
I was just trying
to honor the old guy.
Besides, I didn't think it could hurt.
Listen, I think I'm gonna go home.
- I'll catch you later for a beer.
- Later.
- See him?
- I saw him.
He can't be over there.
How y'all doing?
You're the last asshole Janero sends.
Wait, you got it all wrong!
I'll kick your ass so hard, you'll
have to unbutton your collar to shit.
It's not what you think.
Janero did hire us.
But this ain't a hit.
Janero doesn't want
anything to happen to you.
We're your...
bodyguards.
Those letters all came from your files.
"Harlan Rook." God.
Yes, I remember him.
Every time I was at a film festival
or a seminar, he was there.
Mr. Know-It-All, I used to call him.
He knew everything about me and my films.
To tell you the truth,
I found it a little unnerving.
What'd he want?
He had this screenplay for a low-budget
horror film he wanted me to direct.
Yeah. Said it would be
the ultimate Peter Swan film.
He was crazy.
I couldn't get rid of him.
Finally, I had my attorney
put a restraining order on him.
Then what happened?
I didn't see or hear from him again.
That must have been over a year ago.
Is he the one?
The typewriter that was used
on these letters...
is the same one used
to tip us off to the Dead Pool.
Put in a call to Swan's attorney
and see what he knows about Rook.
- And run a DMV check on the address.
- Right.
Harry, it might not be such a bad idea
to start playing it a little safe.
Maybe I can get your granddaddy
to paint me up.
Look, Harry, I'm being serious.
Don't go anywhere you normally go,
not even home. You can stay with me.
Thanks for the offer,
but I think I can do a little better.
Price of fame.
So this is what Ackerman meant
by cooperating with the press?
It must have been one of those
in-depth interviews.
I think I got a lead on Rook.
A psychiatrist who treated him.
Good.
- Give it a try.
- Okay.
It won't respond.
Someone's on my frequency.
Forget it. It's just not working.
Now, what the hell is that?
Harry.
Time's up, Callahan.
You all right, Al?
Shit.
Two fractu red ribs.
He bled into the chest.
We drained it and set up an IV.
He's lucky, the bulletproof vest
he was wearing saved his life.
Another one of my
grandfather's superstitions.
When your partner gives you advice,
take it.
Harry.
This is Dr. Friedman,
Chief psychiatrist here at the hospital.
I'm sorry about what happened.
In a way, I feel somewhat responsible.
Your partner contacted me about
a former patient of ours.
- Harlan Rook?
- Yes.
At first, I didn't recall the name.
It took me till today to find the file.
He was evaluated here about a year ago.
The diagnosis was
process schizophrenia.
- Multiple personality.
- Not exactly.
His own sense of self-hate
was so strong...
that he no longer really had
any personality of his own.
Consequently,
he substituted identities...
found in books, films...
fan magazines.
Identities with which he had
love-hate relationships.
You didn't think he was
dangerous enough to hold?
Most mentally ill people
are not violent, inspector.
By law, a person who poses no danger
can only be held for 72 hours.
I'm sorry, this is one instance
where the system failed.
- This address here, is this recent?
- I assume it's still the same.
Samantha Walker.
<i>This is Peter Swan, Ms. Walker.</i>
<i>Your Coverage of my predicament
has been thorough...</i>
<i>but my side hasn 't been told
as well as it might have</i> been.
I see.
<i>I'm prepared to grant you
an exclusive interview.</i>
<i>Are you interested?</i>
No doubt about it.
He's our boy, Harry.
Explosives. Caps.
Detonator. It all connects.
Hey, Harry, you gotta see this.
Talk about obsession.
Looks like he had a real
Peter Swan shrine going here.
I'm not sure.
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.
But I'm not sure.
- Bob, do you have my little mike?
- It's in your bag.
Thank you.
Look at this.
<i>I'll</i> call the TV station.
Samantha went out to the shipyard
to interview Peter Swan.
Swan doesn't know anything about it.
- What's this?
- A payroll stub.
Sundown Security Company,
made out to Ed Butler? I don't get it.
That's the company that provides
security for all of Swan's locations.
Ed Butler may be an alias for Rook.
Where are you going? Harry?
Harry!
That's my car!
Yes. That's the shot I'm looking for.
What is it you want from me?
You've got it wrong, love.
This is what you wanted.
An exclusive interview.
But you're not Peter Swan.
Shut up! You don't know!
You don't know!
I know who I am.
Do you know who you are?
- Do you?!
- Yes.
All those films he made.
Those are my nightmares, not his!
Every night I dream, and somehow...
Somehow he reads my mind.
He stole my thoughts.
He put my thoughts on film for all to see,
and he takes all the credit.
He can't get away with it.
He has to pay.
He stole my nightmares
and made them real.
So I stole his Dead Pool.
I'll play his game and make it real.
Let him take the credit for that.
Drop it, Rook.
You didn't die, Callahan,
so I had to find me another celebrity.
- You're next.
- Shoot me, Callahan.
Maybe you'll get lucky.
Maybe my muscles won't Contract
and drive this knife into her throat.
Let her go.
First the gun.
Drop it and kick it over to me.
Time's up, hero. What's it gonna be?
What the fuck?
Now you've locked yourself in, asshole.
Yeah.
Just you and me, asshole.
The gun, Callahan.
Novw "Nol."
He'll kill us both!
Oh, God.
You let me down,
Mr. Famous Fucking Cop.
You let Swan get away.
You're the killer, not Swan.
I should've killed you first.
That was my big mistake.
Now kick it over to me.
Harry, don't.
Think you're smart, don't you?
Callahan, you son of a bitch!
I'm gonna kill you slow!
Give it up, Callahan!
Stay in there.
Callahan!
Come on out, Callahan.
There's nowhere left to run, Callahan.
Don't make me come in and get you.
The game's over!
You're out of bullets.
And you know what that means.
You're shit out of luck.
- Where's Rook?
- He's hanging out back there.
Inspector, was this another
hit attempt by Janero?
Does it have anything to do
with the Dead Pool case?
