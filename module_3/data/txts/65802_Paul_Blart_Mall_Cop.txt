That woman is Iike an angeIic goddess

PIus, she has some crazy sexy feet<i>;</i>
PauI, the pain of this breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man<i>;</i>
Pahud, no one can bIame you

I mean, the hoIidays are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix<i>;</i>
Wow<i>;</i> Them<i>'</i>s some heavy words, PauI BIart<i>;</i>

And I<i>'</i>m not gonna sugarcoat it,

Okay<i>;</i> I<i>'</i>m caIIing an audibIe here, everyone<i>;</i>
And I need to get this maII Iocked down

At my command,

Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed<i>;</i>
AII I heard was <i>''</i>Iunch<i>''</i> and <i>''</i>friend<i>;''</i>

But I know who the Ieader is<i>;</i> It<i>'</i>s Veck<i>;</i>
Veck? The trainee?

Nobody wins with a head butt<i>;</i>
