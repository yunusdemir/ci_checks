    Hey, Dylan. Nice phone.
You expecting a call from 1997?

         -(KIDS GROAN)
  -Make it stop! Make it stop!
          -Seriously?
    Good morning, everybody.
      You know the drill.
      -It's sombrero time.

   Are you well this morning,
           everybody?
    Everyone well, are they?
      Thank you very much.
    Kevin. Payload, please.
       Thank you, Kevin.
             -Wait.
          -Here we go.
             -Yeah.
   -Thank you. Anything else?
    -Thought there might be.
             -Yeah.
 -Game Boy. That's old-school.
           -And that.
-There's probably a couple more.
   -Oh, sorry. Got one more.
        One more phone.
      Everyone needs two.
  Are we done? At least you're
reading your books, which is...
              Oh.
      Thank you very much.
        Uh, everybody...
         This morning,
we shall start with a pop quiz.
          -(ALL GROAN)
           -Psyched!
         We're actually
   gonna have some fun today.
 I have a student teacher here
        from Melbourne.
       Please, everyone,
      say hello to Jethro.
          -Hi, Jethro.
           -Hi, kids.
            TEACHER:
 We're gonna head to the hall.
  Everyone out of your chairs.
  We'll make our way quietly.
            JETHRO:
 Today, I'm going to teach you
          how to make
    the perfect paper plane.
       -(TEARS PACKAGING)
        -(KIDS EXCLAIM)
 Alright, so, first time, we're
gonna make it however you want.
 You can do it your own design,
       whatever you like.
 We'll just pass these around.
Pass those around. There you go.
 Then I'll teach you some tips
          a bit later.
      So who's gonna make
     the best paper plane?
    TEACHER: I'm gonna make
     the best paper plane.
            -Not me.
       -Not you? Come on!
    Where's your confidence?
   So how far do people think
   they can get their planes?
     -10 metres? 5 metres?
           -KID: 50.
      50? You're dreaming.
 The distance world record for
 a paper plane is 69.13 metres.
            -Whoof!
      -That's a long way.
        To even qualify
  for the junior championship,
    you need to hit at least
  25 metres, which would mean
 it'd have to go over that wall
 and halfway down the veranda.
       Does anyone reckon
      they could do that?
       -We could do that.
    -Get it past that wall?
  -TEACHER: We could do that.
  -JETHRO: You could do that?
          -KIDS: Yes!
      -JETHRO: We'll see.
 -KID: I know how we'll do it.
           -Alright.
      If you're finished,
   hold up your paper plane.
   Oh, there's some good ones
           in there.
     Pretty good. Alright!
      Get up. Let's do it.
         -Everyone up.
  -Let's go, people. Come on.
        JETHRO: Come on.
        Move the chairs.
        We're gonna see
    who can go the furthest.
            Alright,
    let me see your planes.
  Good. Good. Oh, that's good.
       Interesting. Nice.
        Nice. All ready?
        Ready to launch?
          On my count.
     ALL: One, two, three!
        (MAJESTIC MUSIC)

           -Let's go!
           -Come on!
    (KIDS CHATTER EXCITEDLY)
         Oh, come back!
       That's incredible.
    -What's your name, mate?
       -Uh, Dylan Webber.
       -It's over there!
         -I can't see.
 Thought about making a career
          out of this?
     -Making paper planes?
             -Yeah.
 (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ON TV)
          DYLAN: Dad!
      Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad,
         Dad, Dad, Dad.
          -Guess what.
             -What?
  If I can make a paper plane
         fly 25 metres
    in the state competition
           on Sunday,
  I can make it to the Aussie
junior championships in Sydney.
It'll be really fun, and we can
   practise on the weekends.
-I've already got a bit of a...
   -I'm sorry, what...? What?
       -What? -You didn't
   go to work today, did you?
    You've just gotta lift.
          OK. I know.
             Yeah.
              Ah!
            Lifted.
       Now. Tell me more
    about your paper plane.
  Tell me about the 25 metres.
  -If I can make a paper plane
    fly 25 metres... -Yeah?
         ..I might just
    get a chance to compete
         in the Aussie
junior championships in Sydney.
           -Will it?
      -Oh, it already did.
  This was, of course, before
the landing, which was a bit...
          -You think?
           -(LAUGHS)
Personally, I think it's the way
    that you fold the paper.
      Pinching it, just...
      to make that crease.
   How do you know all this?
    Like, the...the creases
   and the folding and the...
             -Huh?
        -Mum taught me.
       What are we gonna
        have for dinner?
         I don't know.
       What do you want?
       I don't mind. Oh.
      How does this sound
          for a plan?
        Your favourite.
     TEACHER: Nine, eight.
         We can't wait.
          Seven, six.
      Dylan's got tricks.
          Five, four.
     Fly through the door!
      Three, two, one. OK.
 -Let's get this party started.
             -Yep.
 -Rocking is about to commence.
            -Great.
           -Alright.
          -Here we go.
  Well, that was embarrassing.
             Again.
             Again.
             Again.
             Again.
             Again!
       You've got no idea
         how irritating
     that 'again' thing is,
          by the way.
             Again.
           (EXHALES)
         -What do I do?
      -You figure it out.
That's not really helpful advice
        from a teacher.
     Well, as your teacher,
        I'm telling you
       to use your brain
       and figure it out.
 TEACHER: I'm about to rub out
         section three.
      -Are we finished it?
          -KIDS: Yep.
      TEACHER: Brilliant!
       This is how I make
a piece of paper fly 25 metres.
             -Whoa!
           -(CRASH!)
           KID: Whoa!
     Try not to be annoying
    your whole life, Kevin.
   Back on your chair, mate.
     Right. Where were we?
         (DOOR SQUEAKS)
  -So lovely to see you again.
    -Thank you. My pleasure.
          Grandpa! Hi.
          -Oh. Hello.
          -Oh! Dylan!
      How you going, mate?
  Who was that lady, Grandpa?
   She's just an old friend,
          that's all.
         I was just...
     just helping her out.
      Well, must have done
          a fine job,
       because she looks
         pretty happy.
  It's important to have pride
         in your work.
So my plane flew over 50 metres
          first time.
  It didn't go anywhere close
           the next.
      You...you were a...
       you were a pilot.
    Do you have...any ideas?
   Well, maybe we can fashion
  some sort of a small engine
  and fix it to the airframe.
     You know, I'm actually
 pretty sure you can't do that.
  We could make it very small
   so's...so no-one'd notice.
  I believe they call that...
           cheating.
            (LAUGHS)
 Course, I only had experience,
           you know,
    flying powered aircraft.
 That was during the war. So...
     There's only one thing
         for it, mate.
       You'll have to put
     your thinking cap on.
      Right. Well, that's
 what my teacher said as well.
   Anyway. This is me, then.
         (DOOR SQUEAKS)
         -Hello, Beryl.
            -Hello.
 You gonna...help her out too?
 Thanks for dropping by, kiddo.
         -DAD: Wake up!
         -DYLAN: What?
       -What, what, what?
           -Come on.
             -What?
           -Come on!
          What? What?
       What? What? What?
       I've got an idea.
 You know, I can transfer those
 to a DVD or a...a flash drive.
What, you gonna try and drag me
     into the 21st century?
          Or the 20th.
  Got it. Come here. Come on!
      This is Australia's
   greatest sporting moment.
Everyone remembers it because...
       ..this was the...
       first time we won.
    (CHEERING AND WHISTLING)
 MAN: <i>'Australia II' picked up</i>
           <i>an amazing</i>
    <i>one minute and 18 seconds</i>
    <i>and with that, slid into</i>
 <i>the lead with one leg to sail.</i>
    <i>And this was what won it</i>
       <i>for 'Australia II'.</i>
   <i>-The bulbous winged keel...</i>
             -There.
           <i>..that made</i>
  <i>the West Australian 12-metre</i>
         <i>so competitive.</i>
    You see it? There. That.
    That's the winged keel.
        Alright, now...
     They kept it a secret,
   and the reason was 'cause
   Ben Lexcen, the designer,
   he knew better than anyone
           how a boat
    went through the water.
  Keels used to be like this.
     He made his like this.
  So, what's your winged keel?
       Well, I don't have
         a winged keel.
          Well, then,
       you gotta find it.
  That is what everyone says.
      Grandpa, my teacher.
          And now you.
    OK. Here's some advice.
  Study everything that flies.
        (SNAPS FINGERS)
             Right.
  Oh, I should go back to bed.
              Hey.
             -Yeah?
             -Yeah.
          Thanks, Dad.
 Hey, your grandad had some...
  some toys in the shed, yeah?
 Maybe some of them could fly,
           you know?
             Yeah.
             What?
             Shoes.
   Who needs that many shoes?

         You having fun
 playing with your little toys?
   I'm not playing, Einstein.
         It's research.
        That's research?
   Look, if you're gonna come
  up here and cause a problem,
          can you go,
      'cause I want to...
 OK, but... My dad used to have
         one of those.
    I know how to set it up.
             Great.
            Awesome.
          -(CRUNCHING)
          -Ooh. Sorry.
      It's really old, eh?
        Ah, that's fine.

         -That's fine.
      -Better stand back.
        -Yeah, come on.

        That is so cool!

  gotta get going pretty early
    if we want to make it to

           You know,
 when Muhammad Ali was my age,
  he'd already started boxing.
      He once caught a kid
       stealing his bike
      and wanted to learn
      how to beat him up.
         You do realise
     Muhammad Ali ended up
   with Parkinson's disease,
     unable to talk, right?
 That's not the point, Patrick.
   Hey, stop calling me that.
        I'm your father.
       BOY: The point is,
   he started somewhere, OK?
My journey to become a champion
      starts here, today.
         Being champion
 shouldn't be the goal anyway.
You're saying it doesn't matter
      if you win or lose?
    No. I'm saying it's how
 you play the game that counts.
    You know the only people
          who say that
          are the ones
      who've already lost.
   Winners celebrate winning.
              -Hi.
      -What was your name?
       -Uh, Dylan Webber.
         -Jason Jones.
    MAN: ..two, one, throw!
           Very good.
   Now, go grab your planes.
           (APPLAUSE)
       Right, next group
        up to the line.
    Can I get the next group
    up to the line, please?
       Right, be careful
       not to step over,
       'cause if you do,
      that's a foot foul.
       Now, we're aiming
      for over 25 metres.
       If you throw over
  25 metres today, you qualify
 for the national junior paper
 plane championships in Sydney.
     We're gonna count down
       from three to one,
    and when the flag drops,
make sure it's your best throw.
         Are you ready?
     Three, two, one, fly!
             Whoa!

     Yeah, well done, Jase.

         Yeah, I guess.
      Excuse me, Mr Jones.

  to ask for a photo with you.

     -MAN: Thanks. Cheers.
        -JASON: You see?

      even 20 years later.

      Where have you been?
At the paper plane competition.
        Which was today.
   Maybe I should have put it
    on one of the old videos
  that you're always watching.
   Had to go on my own, and I
almost missed the bus, alright?
  I tried to wake you, but...
             Yeah.

        You just decided
 to take money from my wallet?
  -Yeah, to buy a bus ticket.
-Alright. Well, you're grounded.
              Huh?
        I did it 'cause
     you wouldn't wake up.
           One week.
I made it through to the finals,
     if you're interested.
            -Great.
 -They're next week, in Sydney.

            Grandpa!
    What are you doing here?
       I've been thinking
   about this plane of yours.
     -How did you get out?
           -Get out?
I'm not a prisoner of war, boy.
    Well... I know you need
  written permission to leave.
           Nah, nah.
     That's just red tape.
         Hey, hey, hey.
   Whoa, Grandpa. Did you...
 Did you borrow that ambulance?
       I prefer 'stole'.
   This is the way to travel,
             kiddo.

             Three.
             Four.
    Here, boys, doesn't this
   bring back some memories?
             Great!
          I was hoping
       it was still here.
         Come on, son.
     And, uh, put this on.
Um... I'm too old for this, Pa.
Quite the contrary. I'm too old
 for this. But just put it on.
But when they arrest us, I don't
  want to look like an idiot.
         Just put it on
        and get up here.
             Right.
        -Are you right?
             -Yep.

  -GIRL: We love you, Maureen!
     You've all been chosen
because you have a great gift -
  the ability to turn this...
          ..into this.
             -Wow.
             -Whoo!
            In 1999,
 this plane took me to compete
  in Cape Town, South Africa.
    (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
            (LAUGHS)
             What?
    It's such a lame plane.
    I thought it was a joke.
          OTHERS: Boo!
       Oh, boo yourself.
          Oh, anyway.
Today, let me introduce a guest
  from Japan - Kimi Muroyama.
    (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

  paper plane junior champion.

       It's just a girl.

has only been here for one day,
  one day, and you've already

      -Just give it back.
           -Or what?
   -Or we'll have a problem.
            -Really?
             -Yeah.
    -And what would that be?
    Don't know, but I guess
   you're about to find out.
          Is that so?
            (SIGHS)
          Oops. Sorry.
       He's not worth it.
             Yeah.
KIMI: "Do emus dream of flying?"
           -Too much?
        -It's beautiful.

      the chosen finalists
   from all around Australia.
 Today, you're going to compete
   in a series of challenges.
   (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
            MAUREEN:
   The winners will get to go
to the world junior paper plane
 championships in Tokyo, Japan!

    OK, everyone, form into
   your teams, and good luck!

           And stop.
      Take your positions.
              OK.

         (PISTOL FIRES)
              Hi.
       That was awesome.
  That was really incredible.
           Thank you.
       What are you doing
      to that poor plane?
         It's a whale.
             Right.
     My father always said
  to look at the natural world
          for answers
     to life's challenges.
      And you're sure that
          that works?
              Yes.
            Alright.
      Wouldn't it be great
        if it was about
     more than whose plane
      flies the furthest?
If it was about making something
    beautiful or surprising?
     That's the competition
         I want to win.
          You're mad.
        Absolutely mad.
     MAUREEN: This is it -
      the final challenge.
  If you succeed, you will get
     to represent Australia
   at the world championships
           in Tokyo.
    (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
  The goal is to reach the end
      of the 50-metre pool
    without using a run-up.
     Your plane must touch
    the far end of the pool.
       If you don't touch
      the end of the pool,
  you won't be going to Tokyo.
       OK, time to throw.
   Let's start from this end.
            And go!

I've got to work on my distance.
That's gonna win me the finals.
    I reckon we should start
   practising on the weekend
         so we can find
        my winged keel.
        Imagine how good
         it'll be then.
        Well, the finals
         are in Japan.
              So?
           Can I go?
             Japan?
      -Japan is expensive.
            -I know.
     But I thought that if,
      A, you start working
            and, B,
   I get an after-school job,
        I could at least
    make it there and back.
          Yeah, maybe.
         "Yeah, maybe"?
      What does that mean?
   Does that mean that you're
      gonna start working?
-Can I get an after-school job?
        -Shh. I can't...
       (SIGHS) It's so...
        Oh, it's Japan.
            (LAUGHS)
   It's an after-school job.
        It's ridiculous.
     It's not gonna happen.
     It's not gonna happen.
           I'm sorry.
         You're sorry?
        No, you're not.
      -You are not sorry.
         -Oh, come on.
    We're in Sydney. You've
  been in here the whole time.
        You didn't even
    come to the competition,
      which is the reason
        that we're here.
      Look. Look at this.
   There's a world out there,
            alright?
          You don't...
     You just don't get it.
        I don't get it?
     You don't get it, Dad!
       You don't get it.
      I'm 12 and I get it.
          She's dead.
   She's not gonna come back.
             Ever.
       We're never gonna
         see her again.
          -Well done.
            -Thanks.

          This is me.
     This is where I live.
           Hi! Hello.
           -Hi. Hey.
    -Sorry. That was my mum.
   Hi. Um... You were right.
           The answer
    is in the natural world.
          I found out
  that with the bird of prey,
 it's their wingspan that keeps
  them in the air for so long.
 So imagine this is the bird -
         it kind of...
    ..changes its wingspan.
              -Oh!
  -It changes it as it glides.
   And that just keeps it up.
        Get some paper.
    I'll show you something.
       If you like birds,
       you'll like this.
  Follow me. Grab this corner.
  And pull it through the fold
           like this.
      Now, this is called
        the valley line.
          -Like this?
         -That's right.
 And now, the tricky bit. See?
 It's called the diamond shape.
             -This?
             -Yes.
         Now, the pinch
     for the neck and beak.
           And voila!
    See? You can turn paper
         into anything.
          It's great.

      That's not for sale.
         Come on, mate.
     Everything's for sale.
   I could do with the money,
        but it's, uh...
  -No, it's just not for sale.
          -Two grand.
     It's worth a lot more
        than that, mate.
      OK, OK. Look... 2-5.
         No, I'm sorry.
   It has sentimental value.
There's nothing more sentimental
   than a roll of cash, mate.
     MAN: OK. Three grand.
       Not a penny more.
     It belongs to my wife.
    MAN: Well, you'd better
    get her down here, mate.
       She might be able
  to talk some sense into you.
  She's clearly not using it.
            Please.
          Yeah. Um...
     Yeah, I'm sorry. I...
       I...I just want it
        for my daughter.
   She's...just starting out.
     You know, she's good.
     She's really talented.

             Sorry.
              Oh.
  If you change your mind, um,
        give me a call.
     Quite a few sales, eh?
         Yeah, it's OK.
         Do you want to
       just pop it here?
           -Oh, yep.
         -Thanks, mate.
     OK. I've got the total

   They moved a lot of units.
   And that, Dylan, is enough

  you counted it up correctly?
 Dylan. I'm your maths teacher.

      That guy's a bully.
    You did the right thing.

    is it worth losing for?
       Winning and losing
        doesn't matter.
           -Come on.
          -It doesn't.
  It's about making something
   beautiful, and surprising.

      what you're saying,
   but you still want to win,

 But I really, really want to.
       Yeah? Why is that?
       Well... You know,
everyone loves a winner. Right?
And if...if I go home a winner,
        maybe my dad...
        ..might want to
       hang out with me.
   Well, you know what? He's
 family, mate. And sometimes...
      Sometimes they take
  a little while to come good.

        Pretty nervous.

Um... Yeah, everything's great.
 Uh... Oh. I sprained my wrist,

 But it's feeling better thanks
  to the help of acupuncture,
     which was pretty good,
           but, um...
     Yep. I've been having
     the most amazing time.
  It's really fun. Hopefully,
  we come back here some day.
