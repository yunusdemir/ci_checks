Violence filled the streets as the
Mayor declared martial law today.
Naming Detroit as the most
dangerous city in America.
The housing project has been sealed
off from the rest of the city.
The homicide rate is at
its highest in 40 years.
Community activists fear
the projects, known
as Brick Mansions, will
become a no-go zone.
More protesting of the
construction of the 40 foot wall
that will separate Brick Mansions
from the rest of the city.
These checkpoints will monitor all
movement in and out of Brick Mansions.
Gentlemen...
This development is a beacon
of light in our dark city.
Eco friendly residences,
exclusive shops and offices
all situated on 20 acres of the most
valuable property that the city owns.
Now, with your cooperation
and your backing,
we're gonna restore Detroit
to it's former glory.
Mr. Mayor.
This land is currently the Brick
Mansions housing projects.
In order for this to go up,
that has to come down.
Yes, what is it do you envision for
the people currently living there?
Well, as your Mayor I can assure you
that all the people of this fine city
will be taken care of.
Gentlemen, to the future.
- Yo, yo, yo.
- What's up killer?
Check that shit out.
What's cooking my brothers?
Yeah, you best keep
on rolling dawg.
- Yo, what are you doing here, K2?
- Come on now, why the hate?
I'm looking for Lino. He's
got something for me.
- Lino ain't here.
- Nah.
I'm gonna bet Lino's
up there right now.
Thinkin' he can change the
ghetto 20 kilos at a time.
- Bet yo ass ain't gonna find out.
- Whoah...!
I'm gonna leave you my number.
And when Mr. Clean comes back,
you tell him to give me a call.
Come on, K2.
Pull'em up. Bring'em up!
Y'all know where Lino stay at?
- Yes.
- Come on.
- Where?
- Right, right.
Lino.
Right, it down that
hallway, left door!
I'm comin' ta get you.
Knock this damn door down.
On my count.
One, two...
- Move!
- Catch that little bitch!
Lock this piece of
shit building down!
- She is cute, I know.
- She's got a great ass, man.
- Hi, kids.
- Hey, Lino.
Ah, hell no.
- Tremaine's gonna slice both y'all.
- What do we do?
Who's we?
I'm gonna kill this mother...!
Get him!
He's on the roof!
What's going on man?
Damien, you forgot me.
No, I'm just throwing
some overtime at work.
How much do you need?
Oh, okay, well...
Well, I'll see what we can do.
But never call my
cellular phone again.
Who give Tito my number?
Mr. George, I'm
sorry, I didn't know.
Where was I?
- K2, calling.
- K2!
Loses a package. Needs another
20 before Tremaine flips out.
Best part, he wants
it delivered.
Guess where... Brick Mansions.
Now, who wants to venture into
that shithole on a Friday night?
I would.
Think you can handle it?
I handle what needs handling.
All right.
You know, my mama be
turning in her grave
she see me adding this much hot
pepper to her curried goat recipe.
Know what I appreciate most
about my mother's recipe?
You get the right ingredients...
you can never go wrong.
Which leads me to
this morning, K2.
I believe you had the right
ingredients and clear instructions.
Bring back Lino and my 20 kilos
that he jacked from you.
Yet, here we are,
no Lino, no kilos.
Look, big dawg, me and
Rayzah, you know...
Don't you go blamin'
this on no woman, dawg.
There's five of my men died today
because your little shit show.
That's five more funerals... five more
severance packages I gotta send out.
That's all, nigga, why
should I make six?
Well, should I make it six?
I pay good money for your
services around here.
I need some good ideas.
You got any good ideas?
How about you,
Smiley? Any ideas?
No, sir.
And that's six funerals.
Shall I make it seven?
Hold up, hold up, hold
up! Lino got a girl.
Back in the day, he helped
her get out the hood.
We grab that bitch and I swear
he's gonna come around.
- You know where she's at?
- Yeah, we know where she at.
Don't come back
here without her.
Yo, trust me, man.
A'ight.
That's him, George the Greek.
How long you've been with
me now Damien, a year?
Yeah, about that.
It's a good time for you to
see what we're all about.
Where are you going? Go
park the car in the back.
Cheng, how is it going?
You kill me, Cheng. You kill me.
Damien, Cheng. Cheng, Damien.
- You're a man of many talents.
- I try.
Cheng, you have
some change for me?
Cool.
All team, they've
gone underground.
You ever been to
Southeast Asia, Damien?
No, I've never been there.
He's found the stash.
Hey, prep me 20 key,
20... it's a rush.
South East Asia poppies grow
by the side of the road
which is why the dope
there is worth shit.
But every time it crosses a
border, it triples in value.
Used to be that, by the
time it got to the States
there was only so much
profit you could squeeze.
And then, we got Brick Mansions.
Our very own border and
it's less than a mile away.
I went to a business school, the
best business school in the world.
4 years, half a million bucks.
You just have to
remember one thing.
People pay the most for
what they cannot get.
Can I have that GPS?
The routes are pre programmed.
Don't lose it.
Hey boss, take a look at this?
How the hell did they
know we're here?
Now, they know... we are here.
We weren't suppose to be here.
No one knows we're here, unless
that person is already here.
Damien, you take
this. Take'em out.
In the sewers! Let's
go! Let's go!
Go to the bottom
marker! Come up CLEAN!
All teams, go!
- Damien, phone me.
- You bet.
- Put it down!
- The hell are you doing?
Nobody move! Those are my friends
outside, you're all under arrest!
Now I want you all to put
your guns in the tank!
Put'em in the tank!
Get down on the ground.
Wait for my friends to arrive.
Okay, get this
bastard off my car!
Faster!
Damn, this kid is determined.
Do you have anything stronger?
I like it.
Keep it steady.
I got him!
What the fuck!
Shit!
Get out of the car! Get
out of the car now!
That's George the Greek.
Check your most wanted list.
Get out of the car right now!
I'm Detective Collier,
undercover narcotics.
- Show us your ID.
- Sure.
You're next.
ID please.
You're all right,
I'll take over.
- How long do you need?
- One hour, tops.
- Here you go, Sam.
- Thank you, Lola.
Enjoy.
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Lola.
Grandpa, what was our deal?
- One a day.
- What's all that down there on the ground?
Come on, how many pleasures
I got left, huh?
I can't even enjoy
reading my paper.
Explain this to me.
He's a bad guy, and
we took him down.
Most of what you read in here
is... is blown out of proportion.
You can't believe
everything that you read.
Like where it says, uh...
"The unidentified undercover,
hanging on, at 80 miles an hour."
Exaggeration.
"Over 300 rounds fired."
It's like a 100 rounds, maybe.
I am... I am so close...
to taking down Tremaine.
So close to making him pay.
Revenge and justice are
not the same thing.
And... your grandmother is gone.
Your father is gone.
You are all I've got left.
And I'm gonna be around
for a very long time
because I'm a very
healthy old man, okay?
All right, so here's the deal.
- I'll get this one last scumbag.
- Okay.
And you keep these to one a day.
Oh, hah! I'll cut these out
altogether, right now,
and you forget about going
after that last scumbag.
Yeah.
Just like I thought.
Move, bitch.
Whatchu looking at, fool?
Get your ass back.
You Latino? Where you from?
Mexico?
Brazil?
What's going on here, Rayzah?
Nothing.
Me and home girl
gonna chill later.
Let me get down to business.
Lola, please.
- What do you want?
- Your boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
You and old Lino broke up?
I haven't see him in years.
That's not what I heard.
Really? Well, I guess you'll just
have to add me to the list then.
What list is that?
The list of people who don't give
a shit about what you heard.
That's cute.
You listen to this.
I suggest we get along.
Because your pretty ass ain't going
nowhere until Lino shows up.
- Hey Lola.
- Lino, what the hell are you doing?
- If you're going to be mad, I can go.
- You're here for bullshit, I know it!
Can you two work out your
relationship between you
when you don't got a
gun to my throat?
His having a gun to your throat
is the issue in our relationship.
All right, everybody
just cool down.
Should I take the shot?
Nigga's got his 45
against my neck!
Move!
You too!
Tell Tyrel Glenn to step off.
Ease back! Back!
Let's negotiate. Talkin'
shit will end in blood, man.
Stop selling dope in the
neighborhood, end of negotiation.
Don't shoot!
Let this madman through.
One time offer, mijo...
I forget about the 20 keys.
Let you go back to your
pretty tower, live in peace.
- And we stay out of each other's business.
- Not good enough.
How far are you gonna
walk out before one of
these niggas puts a
shot in your back, huh?
- You get hit?
- Back!
Maybe I get hit.
Maybe we all die.
- Maybe your pretty girl get hit, huh?
- Back off.
My boys, they are going
to kill you, frenchie!
Then go back and burn down your pretty,
full of crap building to the ground!
And for what, huh?
There no more heroes
around here, Lino.
I'm not so sure about that.
- Come on you son of a bitch.
- Move!
- What, Lino?
- He's locked the door from the outside.
Useless, all of you!
Open the door!
Tyrel Glenn little sister
tell me about his weight.
That my Mustang, you
know. That's my baby.
- Keys!
- Son of a bitch.
- Get back!
- Baby, you drive.
You stress my whip, woman.
You're gonna regret it.
- Shut up!
- In the back!
Man, I'm 6'3, I can't
fit back there.
You're about to get a
couple of inches shorter.
We're going to get
on these bitches!
Shoot the tire! Shoot!
You crazy, woman!
You know how much tires on
one of these things cost?
I'll take care of it, I promise.
There's no place outta here. Just let
me out, you can keep the damn car.
Always negotiating, huh?
Stay right there!
- Open that door!
- Drop it! Drop the weapon!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Get back! - Get out the car!
We're here to see your
captain, don't shoot us.
Get down!
Stay cool.
Move!
This is Tremaine Alexander.
I'm sure you know him.
Yes, we know.
Put your gun down, son.
Nobody move.
Everybody stay cool.
Put your gun down, son.
Give me your weapon.
I didn't do it.
Lock him up!
What? Wait! What the
hell are you doing?
Get your hands off me!
Let me out of here!
Hey! Hey!
Sons of bitches! Let me out!
Hey Mike, how's that
new house you got?
Never mind. Get out
of here, Tremaine.
Guess my donation is
coming in handy, huh?
- Come on, Miss Lola.
- I'm not going anywhere with you!
Tremaine! You son of a
bitch! I'll kill you!
Let me go!
It's all politics, Lino.
I'm a politician.
C'est la vie.
No! Open the door!
Open this door, now!
- You can go.
- Yes, sir!
You gave her to those animals,
you dirty piece of shit.
Sorry, son... way of the world.
Detective Collier, the
Mayor is ready to see you.
Detective, come in.
Detective Collier.
Tom Berringer.
- I was on the force with your dad.
- Nice to meet you.
The Collier family has a
distinguished history with the city.
Damien's father led the last
police raid in Brick Mansions.
His unfortunate death pushed legislation
for us to erect the border.
He's a hero, and from what I
hear, you're a lot like him.
Thank you.
We've been made to understand that
you have somewhat of an expertise
in terms of that neighborhood.
- Yeah, I know it pretty well.
- And who are we?
- Major Reno, U.S. Army.
- Pleasure.
Detective, this is a situation
that demands the best of the best.
Last night... a
government transport,
travelling at a time and route with
minimal civilian traffic was hijacked.
What were they transporting?
N.A.D, Neutron Assisted
Device. A neutron bomb.
We prefer the word device.
Bomb has such negative
connonations.
The device was fitted with
an anti theft mechanism.
Which is triggered... if the case
should be opened the wrong way.
Device activated.
What the fuck?
We need you to infiltrate,
locate the device,
and contact us for the
code to disarm it.
Nah, that can't be done.
That'd take time, planning.
We don't know where it's at,
we don't know who has it.
We know where. Brick Mansions.
We know who.
That's Tremaine Alexander.
Ex-soldier turned
illegal arms dealer.
He used military grade
weapons to unite the gangs,
and take over the
city's drug trade.
Rules with an iron fist.
I spent my entire career
trying to take down Tremaine.
But he never leaves Brick Mansions
and there's checkpoints everywhere.
- You know the routes around'em.
- Yeah, but then what?
We have no intel inside.
No eyes.
- We have your eyes.
- Lino Dupree, French Carribean expat.
Spent most of his adult
life in Brick Mansions.
Knows it like the
back of his hand.
So the best idea you can come up
with is to send me into this shit
with a convict as my partner?
Yeah.
And you got 10 hours, Detective.
What's he locked up for anyway?
Killed a cop.
Dupree, let's go.
You're tansferred.
Get in the van!
Get in!
I'll be back.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, have a good day.
Hey, hey, wait! I need this van!
Are you kidding me? Who
do you think you are man?
You trying to jack me? That
what you're trying to do?
It's my van!
I don't think so.
This is my van.
Really?
It's my van, but if you want a
lift hurry up, the bus is leaving.
Recalculating itinerary.
- Where are we headed?
- Brick Mansions.
There's no way you can drive
this van past the barricades.
Three minutes ago we were handcuffed
in the back of this thing.
Why is a guy like you
going to Brick Mansions?
I'm after Tremaine Alexander.
He killed a friend of mine.
Same asshole kidnapped
my girlfriend.
Ex girlfriend.
Sounds like we got
something in common.
- How do you plan to get inside?
- There's an old smuggling route.
Take a right at 50 meters.
- Better buckle up.
- I prefer to be free.
Suit yourself.
We can lose them
by that East wall.
That's a checkpoint.
Maybe it's crazy but
this GPS is right!
Wrong direction. Please
make a U-turn now.
Shit!
Stop your vehicle now!
I repeat, stop your vehicle now!
Whoa! Whoa! What are you
doing? Are you crazy?
You need to trust me man.
Ah, shit.
God, I can't see shit.
Shit.
- What's wrong with it?
- Steerings gone.
Well, brakes are gone!
Now, we're gone!
Shit. Old smuggling route, huh?
Yeah.
We gotta get the hell
out of here, man.
- Not we.
- What the hell you doing?
- You're a cop.
- You crazy?
Come on. I can smell
cops a mile away.
Hey, come on, you can't
leave me like this.
Come on, help me
get out of here.
What am I supposed to do?
Look in the police manual
under "shit happens."
Yeah, that's really funny.
French asshole.
Shit, this is your car, huh?
- Hell, yeah.
- Well, brake's failed, man, so...
You get me out of here,
we'll sort this out.
Yo health 'bout to fail you now.
Shit.
You're dead, fool.
You're dead, look at you.
Yo, put that down.
Tremaine. Put it down.
Que pasa mamacita?
Hope you've been enjoying
our accomodations.
I'm so done with this place.
Look, you keep it cool with
me, I keep it cool with you.
I try to impress education on my boys,
over here, but they a different breed.
If they're not out cappin'
niggas in the streets
they in some dark room capping
them on a video screen.
So I give them a job, you know.
These niggas feed
their families.
Look, between me and
you, I like Lino.
He has a cause, even
it gets him killed.
People like you remind me
why everyone hates us.
You and him are a
lot alike, man.
- I can see why y'all together.
- Separated.
Well, don't worry, mamacita.
Your hero be here soon.
Oh, you didn't hear
the good news?
Lino escaped.
I'm sure he's gonna
be comin' here.
And I wouldn't wanna be
old when he gets here.
Tremaine, we all good on the roof.
Do you wanna head back over?
Rayzah here will
keep you company.
Yo, get your hands of my chips.
Oh, damn! Oh, shit.
Move!
- How did you know I was a cop?
- You don't belong here.
- How'd you find me?
- Put a bug in your pocket.
Cop tricks. That's
all you people have.
No, we have the law. It just
something you don't care about.
The law means nothing
without justice.
That's pretty highminded for
somebody who killed a cop.
That cop was a corrupt piece of
shit, no better than Tremaine.
I'm gonna find Tremaine.
I'm gonna find him before
the weapon he hijacked
kills everybody inside
of Brick Mansions.
Probably didn't occur to you
that somebody on the outside
could actually give a shit about
what happens in here now, did it?
Not everybody out
there is an asshole.
Just like not everybody in here
is a junkie... or a thief.
You enjoy yourself.
And if I find your girlfriend
I'll tell her you said hi.
They will shoot you and
take your badge as trophy.
At least I'll die trying.
Which is a hell lot better than sitting
around bitching about how the world sucks.
If you're not bullshitting
about that bomb,
maybe I can save Lola
before we all go down.
And the first chance you
get, what are you gonna do?
You gonna put a bullet
in the back of my head?
I could've killed you already.
So what's your plan?
- You got a phone?
- Yeah.
Tremaine, it's
Lino. Comin' over.
So that's it? You just throw
us in the lion's den?
Which no lion would ever expect.
This is gonna be a lot of fun.
Not bad, right?
Oooo, la, la, Lola.
Fuck!
Where are you going?
I knew you'd be fun to play
with from the second I saw you.
I really love this game.
You wanna act like a bitch?
Hey, Rayzah. I heard shouts.
You can play, but
not too hard, okay?
You are one lucky bitch.
What we got here?
Take us to Tremaine.
K2, get your fat ass up
here! We got guests coming!
Yeti, move it! Upstairs, now!
It's show time!
Damien, you see that?
Lino.
Surprised to see you
back here so soon.
You see? He is surprised.
- Who's your boy?
- I'm his driver.
He's a cop.
- Come for his bomb.
- Thanks. Thanks for that.
- That's... that's great.
- Wow, a real live cop.
Haven't seen one of those
around here in years.
I believe the police stations closed around
the same time as the school, the hospital.
And all them other things the government
thought we didn't need around here.
So, what, you're the
new Sheriff in town?
You're a brave man.
Where's Lola?
Oh, we'll get to her.
Let's talk about this
bomb. You here to buy it?
No, I came to disarm it.
That thing's gotta make you a
little bit anxious, ticking.
Tremaine Alexander don't do
anxious. I cause anxious.
I could be halfway down South
before this thing goes off
or you can make me and
my peeps an offer.
I'll offer you to disable it before
it blows us all up, you like that?
Ho, that won't fly. How about I just
send it back the way I found it?
K2, let the sunshine in.
Gentlemen, please, you're
gonna love the view.
Only a crazy person
would have a rocket.
We live in a war zone
to prepare for war.
Now, this thing is rigged to fly
straight downtown at a push of a button.
Let's talk numbers.
You let all those people die over
money? That's low even for you.
Nigga, where I come from, cash
rule everything around me.
You know that one, right?
- Ha, ha, ha.
- First, I need to know Lola's okay.
Rayzah.
Curtain number three.
What do you see?
What do you see, Lino?
No, no, wait.
Coward!
- You wanna die here, man?
- Don't shoot.
Now's not the time.
Lino, not now.
Now you boys are all excited
let's do this shit the uptown way.
On the auction block, alright?
I got a rocket, I got a bomb
and I got a pretty woman.
I say we start the bidding
at 10 million dollars.
- Do I hear 11?
- 11.
- 11 million.
- 12.
Oh, that's a spicy bid, right
there. Oh, we gettin' there now.
- 15.
- 15? Now, stop the bullshit!
You tell me how much it's worth to you?
How much are the people downtown worth?
Because around here, we don't
seem to be worth shit.
Look around, Sheriff, this
used to be a 5 star palace.
Doormen, women
waiting on tables.
Where them bitches at now? In
the alley, shooting it up.
Because of drugs
dealer like you.
I didn't cause this reality. I
just help them ease the pain.
Now cut the bullshit. Let's
get back to that money.
- We was at 15 million, right?
- 15.
- Do I hear 20 million?
- 20.
Okay, stop the game.
What's it gonna take?
You got 3 million
people downtown.
10 dollars per person.
Price of a happy meal.
That's 30 million
dollars for me.
- Then 30 million?
- 30 million.
Done. 30 million it is.
30 million.
Sold to Lino Dupree and the new
Sheriff of Brick Mansions.
Call your people and
make it happen.
And Lino, stay out
of my business.
- Yes?
- It's Detective Collier.
- Collier? Where are we now?
- We're close. Really close.
- Close enough to punch the code in?
- No, unfortunately not.
What's the problem?
The problem is that the
new owner wants to sell.
Are you sure the bomb is there?
Yes, and I can tell you that there's
only 48 minutes before it blows up.
Okay.
- How do we proceed?
- You have an Hawaiian bank account?
- I want it in cash, man.
- They can't do cash.
- We still got an account in Hawaii?
- We do.
Give him the numbers.
Bank, 83675.
Bank, 83675.
Account, 0210-84.
Account, 0210-84.
- What's he asking?
- 30 million dollars.
Ho, hold on.
Tremaine wants 30
million for the device.
The city's damn near broke.
- That's a nonstarter, Detective.
- All right, good.
You have to find
another solution.
Exactly.
All right, good, yeah.
Perfect.
That's a wrap. They're
sending the money.
- Let's go disable that bomb.
- Hold on.
Wait a minute, let my man
verify the funds, first.
Bank doesn't open for
another 25 minutes.
Ahhh, 25 minutes.
Well, that's just enough time
for me to finish dinner.
K2.
Show our guests to the
presidential suite.
Nice doing business
with you, Sheriff.
Move!
Sometimes you don't gotta
be a rocket scientist.
Just got to have a rocket.
Move!
Face the rack!
On your knees!
- Shit.
- Put your damn hands behind your head!
I tell you, I'm claustrophobic.
'Til Tremaine gets his 30 mill, their
lives is worth more than both of ours.
- They die, you die.
- Ok.
See what not having
a plan gets you?
Hey, you know where the bomb is,
I know where Lola is, and in
25 minutes, we're heroes.
In 25 minutes, Tremaine
is gonna shoot us.
The device is gonna
kill 3 million people.
What? When he gets his
money, everybody walks away?
There is no money.
The city can't pay. I was just
trying to buy us some time.
Forget what I said before.
Don't trust your
instincts. They're shit.
I should've killed Tremaine
when I had the chance.
Shut up.
Wait.
That story about Tremaine
killing your friend, it's true?
That's my father. He was leading
some officers on a drug raid.
He got separated from his squad. Tremaine's
boys captured him and killed him.
I'm sorry.
Let's go make him
pay. Back me up.
Help him man!
Stop it! Stop!
- Son of a bitch.
- What happened?
Oh, shit.
- He's not breathing.
- What?
We got to get him out of here.
Shit.
- Oh, come on!
- He's not breathing, come on!
- Okay, go, go!
- Open the gate!
I need the boss.
Go!
- Somethin' don't feel right about this, man.
- You think they'll come up with the money?
We'll see.
Tell me how you got
that bomb again.
Bomb, yeah. This dude at the base told
me about some weapons being moved.
No security. Keys
left in the truck.
Easy money, baby.
See, that's whats bothering me,
man. You can never trust easy.
- I'm okay.
- You're crazy.
We're out of the
room. Your turn cop.
Is this some kind
of game to you?
Ready for a backflip?
On three.
Three!
Go, go, go!
This way!
Catch them!
Go, go, go!
- You know where we going?
- More or less.
Shit.
Damien!
What the fuck?
Different method, same results.
Let's go.
- It's faster.
- Yeah, but you still need the key.
Go, go!
I'll drive.
Get out the way, you fool!
Let's get these guys!
Faster!
- Faster!
- What, you wanna drive?
- Yeah, go ahead, drive.
- Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.
I need to get out.
What are you trying to do
jump out of the damn car for?
- Where you going?
- I'm trying to get rid of these guys.
Will you shut up?
I don't see them! Where they at?
- Rooftops back that way!
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- Come on, tell me, which way, which way we...?
- Left, left!
Go left, the bomb over back
there! We don't have much time!
Back where?
Damn.
Come on!
I told you to stay down!
Hey, look, we can't just
go running up on that
rooftop. I think they're
gonna be expecting us.
- You got a better solution?
- I'm working on it.
Can you work and run?
- Whoah, Tremaine's gonna wild out.
- Come on, this way.
Stay down this time.
They're in the bus!
You two, go check it out.
Let's split up!
- On three!
- Three!
What the...
Shit.
Close enough now?
Thank you.
- Get Defense on the line, immediately.
- Yes, sir.
Hello. What?
Okay. I'm gonna bring
it up right now.
We have an issue.
These are satellite surveillance
images from Brick Mansions
taken several minutes ago.
- There's the bomb.
- What's that?
That's an old Russian surface missile.
Has a radius of about 5 miles.
- How the hell did they get that?
- Wait, man, w-wait, if they launch that thing...
- The city is ground zero.
- We're gonna have to evacuate.
- No time.
- There's a fallout shelter.
It won't help us against
an N.A.D. blast.
What options do we
have then? Drone?
Too late. We'll never get
authorization just like that.
- Bank's open.
- I'll check.
I think they fooled
us. No deposit.
And you wonder why people
don't trust the government.
What the hell is going on?
Not only did they not
make the transfer.
They're emptying
all our accounts.
Rayzah. We're gonna
launch. Stay clear.
Time's up, bitch.
Downtown is about
to get remodeled.
Russian piece of shit.
There goes the controller. Now I'm
gonna get her out of the picture.
Be careful. You'll hit Lola.
No, I wanna get this
one away from her.
Trem. Trem, they took
out the receiver.
Now I got to shoot the
Sheriff and his deputy.
Damn it. Let's go.
Brick Mansion gangsta's!
Time to strap up boys!
We fight or we die!
- What was that?
- Looks like they shot out the launch mechanism.
- The missile can't launch.
- We're still in the game.
I want the building sealed down.
Seal the building
up! Yeti, with me.
Move it!
- That sucks.
- Excuse me.
- One, two, three.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Four, five, six.
- Hey, stop that.
Seven.
Hey, this... this is a bad idea.
I believe you said we were
gonna do it or die trying.
It's an expression.
Don't think. Jump. All instinct.
Aww, this is really
a bad idea. Ahhhhh!
Come on!
Block this exit, man. Be easy
enough for a man of your size.
- Got a plan?
- Kick his ass, don't get squashed.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm
going, I'm going! Shit!
- On three.
- Three.
Three!
Fuck!
Fuck!
What are you doing? Hurry up!
He's really pissed off!
- Yeah, I got it!
- Hurry!
In this great future, you
can't forget your past.
I told you Tremaine's all bluff.
No, Tremaine Alexander
don't bluff.
Nor do I make a stupid bet.
Loosen her chains.
This thing is over.
What are you talking about?
I'm a businessman. I'm not gonna
kill no millions of people.
Gonna have the Sheriff and the
hero come disarm this thing.
And get it out of here
before we all get fried.
- You gone soft.
- You watch your tone, woman.
Watch my tone? What
is wrong with you?
Untie the girl!
Maybe I should just kill
you and do this myself.
Who's the bitch now?
Get away from her!
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm so glad you boys came
to save everyone, man.
Not everyone.
Hey, Lino. They're gonna text
the code. You punch it in.
- Now get down on your knees.
- No, wait.
Let him explain.
You want to shoot an
unarmed man, Sheriff?
At least you're gonna see it coming,
it's better than my father got.
- What I have to do with your father?
- Lieutenant John Collier.
- Collier? You still blaming me for that one?
- He was shot raiding your headquarters.
Wait.
He never entered
the building, man.
I saw the whole thing from
my surveillance camera.
His own men shot him in the back,
left him for dead on my doorstep.
A cold blooded setup.
You're full of shit. Now
get down on your knees.
- Get down on your knees!
- Damien.
- There's a problem.
- What? The number didn't come through?
No, it did.
- 48216.
- That's the code.
- Punch it in.
- It's a setup.
We can't trust those people.
- Punch it in.
- Listen to your man.
They're playing you for a fool the
way they played your father, boy.
Just shut up!
Give me that.
Damien. Think about it.
- Why is it our ZIP code?
- It's a coincidence.
- Give me the phone.
- My instinct says you're arming it.
- You're gonna get us all killed.
- Give me the phone.
- Lino!
- Sorry partner.
I'm sorry.
Back off. Back off.
Stop both of you!
Stay down!
Please! Hurry up!
Damien!
- Collier!
- 20 seconds.
Don't you see? They told
you the van was hijacked.
How come the van had no traces
of that harpoon anywhere on it.
Right now, we wait 5 seconds to
dial the rest of the numbers.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Countdown completed.
Joke's on me.
The law never protected this place
before. Why would it start now?
I've done many bad things, but killing
your father wasn't one of them.
I'm making Detroit
safer for all.
Welcome to our world.
So, what are we gonna
do with this shit?
Let's give it back.
- Cuppa kava, Captain.
- Thank you, son.
- Hold it!
- Let's go!
Hey, come on, no stairs!
Elevator! Let's go, now!
- This is better than the stairs.
- Yeah.
I can't reach him.
We don't have a satellite image. If the
bomb went off, we would've heard it.
I don't like this. I
don't like this at all.
He's our man. He'll
get back to us.
Hello.
What do you mean they're
inside the building?
Hey, you boys remember Lino?
My eyes in Brick Mansions?
Well, he showed me a lot.
Wow! Mr. Mayor. Great
place you got here.
Tremaine Alexander. You could say I'm
like the Mayor of Brick Mansions.
It's a pleasure to
meet my constituaries.
And on behalf on myself, our
new appointed Sheriff and Lino
and the great citizens
of Brick Mansion.
We decided to give you a...
campaign contribution.
Device activated.
- What's going on?
- Believe it or not, I forgot the damn code.
So, what was it? 4-8...
- Detective. We can take it from here.
- 4-8-2-1... - 6.
Are you sure about that?
I think Lino, you said
it couldn't be 6 because
that was the ZIP code
for Brick Mansions. And
that would be too much
of a coincidence?
You said it was a coincidence. I
said they wanted to blow us up.
Yeah, I think all this jumping around
on rooftops has loosened his marbles.
You hit your head one too many times.
You're having a hard time remembering.
Gentlemen, thank you very
much, we'll take it...
I'm pretty sure the
last number is 6.
Mr. Mayor, you want to press the button?
Or do my man Damien gotta to do it?
- Go for it man.
- Give it a push.
Stop! Stop! Enough!
What the hell happened out
there? You had a direct order.
You played me just like
you played my father.
Yeah, and your empathy made you
soft, just like your father.
I have to make the tough decisions for
the city. And I sent this bomb in there
to get rid of it's
biggest problem.
Come on... You know it.
They're no better than animals.
Animals? Who's animals? Men
strugglin' to survive?
Or men who will destoy a whole community,
of underprivileged women and children?
As a Mayor, I have to do what's best
for all the people of the city.
- The hardworking ones...
- You mean the rich ones?
The ones that contribute.
The ones that are sick and
tired of that cesspool.
Cesspool? You need
to wake up, my man.
- These people are rising up.
- And the people...?
Check this out.
They're sick of you.
You'll catch it on the
news, in about 5 minutes.
The Mayor of Detroit was arrested today
after a compromising video posted online
appeared to show him plotting an
attack on Brick Mansions residents.
"And I sent this bomb in there."
The demolition of walls that divide the
city from the Brick Mansions project
will begin next month.
With no date set
for new elections,
the acting Mayor announced plans to reopen
schools, hospitals and police stations...
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
up. That was really good!
Go, go, go, go.
- Yeah, man.
- Yo, Sheriff. What a surprise.
- No more crime to fight around here?
- Come on. It's my day off.
Well, I see you spent your share of
the reward money very responsibly.
I didn't buy this.
Tremaine gave it to me.
No way.
Yeah, yeah, he didn't think
it was right for his image
with the whole Plumb
the People campaign.
- Guy's got my vote, ha, ha.
- We're gonna need it.
What about you partner? I see you're
still fighting the good fight.
- Only with Lola.
- Oh...
Alright, that's about it, now. I gotta
go, you're making me uncomfortable.
- Easy partner.
- He's just jealous.
- You guys.
- Hey, on three?
Three!
