My only choice is easy right?
To jump or not to jump.
This gonna come down to your choice.

Never.
Last year he did a 68 hours straight.
On a hostage negotiation.
He gets everyone out.
He trusted your instincts.
He never quit. He never gave up.
How do you know so much about me?
Cause you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you want to jump.
Is there a moment when you think to.
Someone gonna go off or not?
Sometimes I know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don give up on me.
I can get you off the ledge.

Before you get into trouble.
But Nicky, numbnuts

Cassidy? The Cop who stole
the Diamond off David Englander?
40 million dollar diamonds.
I knew I recognise this man.
David Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry exchange
is right across the street.
What the hell is going on?
What in his little note say?
"I leave this world ..."
when we entered.
"I WILL EXIT AS I ENTERED"
"INNOCENT"
He wants people to think he
didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having
an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family. Toss his cell.
Who did he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How he's doing?
Well he's playing us very cool
like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look.
He is my partner for 5 years.
So ...
Do you think he would jump?
He got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.

Chisel.
Hello everybody.
I'm glad that you can make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Work his ass of this jewelery trade.
So, he was more than a little anxious,
When I uh,
Decided to risk it all on a real estate.
That's why I bought the "Monarch" diamonds.
The one I could to honor him.
You know,
Three years ago,
When the market sank,
They said we were finished.
Remember?
But that what's great
about this country.
If you want it bad enough,
You can make it back.
In this city ...
On this island,
we don't go to work.
We go to war.
And if somebody takes something from you,
You take it back.
And more.
You know I had one precious
jewel taken away from me few years ago.
But now i've got another.
And no one will ever steal it from me.
Ladies and gentlemen ...
We're finally here.
To my new jewel,
the "Monarch Spire".
Congratulations David you pull it off.

Convicted felon.

your suicidal tendencies.
Yes. And I'm sure that
your boss is going to
be sending a team across
the street right now.
Hold on hold on, Nick.
We are not ready yet.

That's isn't freedom.
Standing here in font

The plan is
to prove that I'm innocent.
And this is my retrial.
I'm innocent.
I am innocent man.
Did you get that Lydia?
I am innocent.
Now you go downstairs.

- Nobody is going to get into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
- This is Nestor.
- Englander is clear detective.
Good. At least the
son of a bitch corner my ass anymore.
Roger that.
It's over.
Mercer.
What is that doing here?
- There's a fugitive situation.
Ain't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He's acting like he really believes he's innocent.
Yeah? What does that make?
An honest man or sociopaths.
He ain't an honest man.
I’m going to put an end to this show up here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
- He likes me.
- Marcus.
- Marcus give her a little more time.
- You have 15 minutes.
Then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lads.
All right.
Let's go, "thief".
Are you sure there's
nothing else you wanna tell me?
Move come on!
Ahh shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell?
- You're trying to cheat me?
You don't want know everything.
- Nobody does.
- I'm sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
The best sex of my life?
Obviously.
Hey. Okay. Wait.
Hold on. Hold on.
Step back.
The "Monarch" Diamond is most
recently held by David Englander.
Until it was stolen
by Nick Cassidy
The man on the ledge.
Who set off to untraceable pieces and
sold it.
Time is running out here Nick.
Tactical is on scene.
And I'm tired of being played.
How far would you go? To take down a man
who stole everything from you?
Your Honor.
Your Family.
What would you do?
You do whatever it takes.
After I drove them to tropical
Guys in masked knocked me out and he just
stood there smiling.
- But the jury didn't believe that Nick.
- And even did my lawyer.
And I already spent two years
banging my head against the brick wall,
because I know,
that the "Monarch"
never left his hands.
Why Englander
to steal his own diamond?
He lost 30 million to Lehman.
And about 20 million
in a real estate bust.
He was that close to being a bankrupt.
If he needed the cash he could have
sold it.
No. He won't do that.
Cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Louis of London sent me a check 40 million
for claims.
And he's back.
Come one. I need you
to believe me.
- Come on.
- Who are the thugs?
I don't know.
But know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops.
You what it's like when they are doing
back on you
When your hostage is gone
Today is the day that you
are really gonna save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this.
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You got a little to comfortable to bark at us.
Wassup? How he's doing?
Hasn't kill him yet.
What does he talking?
You know, Mikey ...
One day you you gonna stick your dick,
in the wrong door,
and someone's gonna slam it.
I got some paper
in his cell in Sing Sing.
- Take it up to Daugherty.
- Let me see them.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie ...
What?
You are a living work of art.
Damn.
So. What
the best sex of your life?
No doubt, with you Joey.
- Yes?
- Now ...
There's this one guy in high school ...
He's older
He had his hands.
Don even mess with me.
Let's go.
- And when was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did they have anything?
- Everyone expect the diamond
- The the case goes apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
- Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing is happening.
Across the street?
He can't steal something twice,
especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
- What if he didn't do it?
- Please, Mercer.
Marcus?
Go.
What if there's were other cops
involved in the Englander case?
If you try to get yourself
even more despise in
the department, I'll say
you are into something.
I just found out that Cassidy
was co-operating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody
disappears about a
million bucks worth of
cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave them a name Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
A week after Cassidy went up.
Walker and his car got pulled up of the hut.
Yeah yeah, alcohol level was point 2.3.
Can you stop while you're behind.
Who ever was in it with Walker.
Had every reasons to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegations.
I know Cassidy is not on
this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah? What he's saying?
Fuck you.
- Lads, get your people into positions.
- Now!
- Roger that.
It's game time gentlemen.
- Strapped them?
- Yep.
Let's
Go, Go, Go.
Piece of cake right?
No.
No.
- No?
- No
- Why not?
- I don't think i'll fit in there.
Hey listen.
You can't hold my weight. All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like what we practiced.
Or Nick would kill me
Nick will kill you?
- I am going to kill you.
- Be mad just be mad at the vent.
Get out of here.
Yes? Done.
Yes huh.
Now you see that?
Now you see that?
This occurs when
driven to madness.
This what happens when we push too far.
There's no rich guy in prison.
Nick Cassidy,
Would be any of us.
Nick Cassidy has always maintains he's
innocent.
Do you actually believes he stole
the  "Monarch" Diamond?
I hope he had done it.
Who wouldn't?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Daugherty. Welcome to the party.
- Brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Thank you.
Hey. I’m Lydia Mercer.
- I want to talk to him.
- Yes ...
Do you work for Englander
or was it just Nick?
I do not know what you're talking about.
Was it Joe Walker
set that details up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "so what?".
You are not getting near.
- There's my friend out there.
-And this is my scene.
Daugherty would you talk to her.
Look man that's the lady's call.
We'll will call you if we need you.
- Thank you.
- I hope you better know what the hell you're doing.
- What's this?
- I brought up some food.
I think
the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing kid?
Hang in there.
Bon appetite.
How are you doing there babe?
- I can't do it.
- What?
Babe, the clock is ticking.
We don't have enough time.
Come on.
Do not panic. Angie.
It's a sunny day.
Crowd's cheering.
Yes.
"Jump into my arms"
"We're with you"
Listen to that
they are all cheering for you.
They are on our side. Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I’m in.
All right.
Just relax.
Focus.
You must do this thing fast before
the heat sensor caught up with you.
"Light" as a "flake"
I heard that.
Yes, yes.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
Can't yet.
The whole world
knows you are now, Nick.
You inspired every reporters to
look into your story.
If you're innocent
it will come out.
I’m not going back to custody.
They're going to kill me.
Nick.
Do leave me hanging out here.
Look. Just I need you
to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
That I have him wired.
I'm supposed to be relieved.
But I stay down because I knew.
Only then,
Suddenly I didn't know.
It's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey Mercer.
You want to take a look
at these.
He had bomb kinetics in his cell.
Angie, You're with me.
Tell me what you see.
I see a mass of wires.
Coming out of a circuit.
All right. Now,
Find the main processor.
Like a big hole around it.
- You found it?
- Yes.
- I got it.
- Okay.
As you have practiced, we got to sort it
out to take out the sensors.
First cut the red wire.
The red wire?
There are all red wire.
Nick, it's because of the light.
Maybe pick the reddish one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it Nick.
Shut up and listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one.
Hell is going to break loose.
Done.
Good girl.
Okay,
Now touch the wire to the processor.
All right. It is much easier.
Can make a small spark.
Angie.
Angie?
Angie?
Angie, You hear me?
- You all right?
- Don't talk to me right now.
- Okay?
I can now confirm that the
Bomb Squad has just arrived
on the scene and
Tactical units are
on their way up to the roof on
Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this
escaped criminal.
Is that a bomb?
You ask for my trust
and then this?
This is the moment you make
your choice remember?
Mercer. Tactical a go.
Time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stay down Mercer.
He will go over before he
gets taken down.
Show me our track records
on par with yours.
All right.
Bomb protocols says we clear everybody
But the Negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall.
He's playing you.
Pick you because
You in no condition to do your job.
This is my scene.
My negotiation.

- All right.
Damn.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Oh Shit.
- Someone gonna grab her too?
- Are you kidding me?
He scripted this
On all our ass.
You believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
I do not see any diamonds.
You see something?
- It's got to be here right?
- So he says ...
It's impossible.
- No
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Stay calm.
- There was a time.
- What?

For the first time.

It's not in the vault.
Oh Shit.
Okay Joey. You know what to do.

- We need to leave in 5 minutes

- Good.
- We got an alarm in the Englander.
- Seal the building no one gets out.
All squad be advised we had
an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ.

Someone in the building, sets off a ceiling
on the 15th.
Keep them out of here.
Just give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them.
- I’m on it.
Listen.
What if I find
Walker case?
Doesn't matter.
There's nothing in it.
No this guys there are cautious.
Paranoid. They got shit in the file.

He's expecting your call.

Daugherty said

Yeah that's right.
You should see this.
What's this?
Give me five minutes.
Ackerman opened this door.

Open the door.
