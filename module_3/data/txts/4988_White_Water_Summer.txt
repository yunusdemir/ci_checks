By the age of 17,
a person should have adopted...
the three guiding principles
of his life.
One is sexual...
one ethical...
and the third, optional...
depending on the circumstances.
My choice...
no camping.
Nobody really great
ever slept in dirt.
You ever see a picture of Da Vinci
pitching a tent? No.
How 'bout Einstein
nibbling trail mix?
Let's take a look
at the really great campers.
Genghis Khan,
a lifetime under the stars.
Mu'ammar Gadhafi...
perhaps the world's
greatest camper.
Mr. and Mrs. Marcos.
They recently took it up.
She likes the boots.
For 14 years, I had ducked
all kinds of camps.
<i>Soccer, sailing, tennis,</i>
<i>computer, even chess.</i>
<i>Till this guy showed up.</i>
<i>My intellectual and sexual powers</i>
<i>were just starting to climb...</i>
<i>and my father wanted me to go</i>
<i>to the woods with a bunch of boys?</i>
<i>I'm supposed to do all this with a guy</i>
<i>who doesn't know to take a cab?</i>
<i>And there was Jenny.</i>
<i>Her parents were going away inJuly,</i>
<i>and she was gonna be home alone.</i>
<i>But I leave for six weeks</i>
<i>of Rambo training...</i>
<i>and Fred Bernstein will be</i>
<i>in there in one second.</i>
<i>I become a man,</i>
<i>and he gets the girl.</i>
<i>What an asshole.</i>
<i>Stay cool, Alan.</i>
<i>Panic now, and it's summer</i>
<i>in the Sierras...</i>
<i>with Robin Hood here</i>
<i>and his Merry Men.</i>
It's his first.
A beautiful fish.
Ah, that's his second day
in Red Bluff.
- We camped here.
- Beautiful!
That's wilderness, honey.
That's the real thing.
Tim caught this one.
It was his first.
Beautiful fish.
That's his second day in Red Bluff,
and we're heading upriver.
We camped here.
There's no sign of man for miles.
It's just birds, animals, fish,
a lot of silence.
What if one of the children gets sick,
like something serious?
It's what I'm there for.
That's Devil's Tooth.
We climb the face. There.
- Looks awfully dangerous.
- <i>Good call, Mom.</i>
And here we are, homeward bound.
Jesus, you really do make men
out of these boys, don't you?
I think they make men
out of themselves.
That's it.
<i>Oh, shit.</i>
<i>This guy is slick.</i>
<i>Maybe too slick.</i>
We're making a big mistake.
- He doesn't want to go.
- Alan, what do you say?
Well, I like the pictures.
When I was a kid, I was lucky
if we got to Y camp in Jersey.
It is awfully far, you know?
I think city kids need a time
of isolation, of quiet.
Yeah, I think that's the point.
Alan, it sounds great, doesn't it?
Last week you wanted me
to go to computer camp.
The thing is, Alan is not
exactly the outdoor type.
- What do you think about that?
- I think that's right.
And I think next year,
when he's a little older.
<i>Mom, you're my last line of defense.</i>
<i>Tell him I'm too young,</i>
<i>scared of heights.</i>
<i>Allergic to open spaces.</i>
<i>Yeah, that's the ticket.</i>
What do you say?
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
I tell you, I wish my dad had
done this for me when I was a kid.
We run three groups in late summer.
There's an opening in the third group.
I don't exactly like
big bunches of kids.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I was an only child myself.
- You were?
- Yeah.
See, I can't believe how much
you guys have in common.
- I don't know about that.
- There's only one way to find out.
Besides, it's not a big bunch.
It's only five of us.
- You said four kids.
- Yeah.
<i>The moment of truth.</i>
<i>To pull this one off,</i>
<i>I gotta be firm.</i>
<i>Absolutely not.</i>
<i>No indecision.</i>
<i>I will not go.</i>
Come on. How 'bout it?
I'm not sure. I mean...
I don't know.
<i>So I lied.</i>
Hey, where'd you get the knife?
My dad bought it for me.
I think I'm supposed to
skin a bear with it or something.
- Pretty neat.
- Yeah, kinda is, huh?
- Let me see that.
- Cut it out, George!
I just wanted to see it!
Just what we need,
another dickface.
Major asshole.
Your part goes like this.
<i>You can't run, you can't hide</i>
<i>You can't run, you can't hide</i>
Whoa, whoa.
Wait till I point to you.
Wait till I point to you.
Ready?
<i>Now, if it's love</i>
<i>that you're runnin'from</i>
<i>There's no hiding place</i>
<i>You can't run, you can't hide</i>
<i>Love has problems, I know</i>
<i>but those problems</i>
<i>We just have to face</i>
<i>Now, if you just</i>
<i>put your hand in mine</i>
<i>We're gonna leave</i>
<i>all our troubles behind</i>
<i>Keep on walking, don't look back</i>
<i>Don't look back</i>
<i>Now, if your first lover</i>
<i>broke your heart</i>
<i>There's something can be done</i>
<i>Don't you lose your faith in love</i>
<i>Just because of what he's done</i>
<i>Now, if you just</i>
<i>put your hand in mine</i>
<i>We're gonna leave</i>
<i>all our troubles behind</i>
<i>Keep on walkin', don't look back</i>
<i>Don't look back</i>
- Bullshit.
- He is too.
Vic, aren't you gonna catch a trout
with your bare hands? Tell him.
Yeah. Yeah, that's a Modoc thing.
I'll show you how to do it
when we get up to the Feather River.
Told you.
- Alan, what the hell are you doing?
- This is the part where we eat, right?
You're gonna cut
your tongue off, asshole.
- I can handle it.
- Let me see it.
Turn it around.
It's a West Horn.
One of the counselors had one of these
where I went last summer.
Showed us how you can
really put an edge on it.
Better be careful with that, kid.
One false move, you cut your balls off.
I'll try to stay alert.
Watch out. Let a real man
take care of business for a second.
You're never gonna
get through it in one shot.
Wrong.
- When do we eat?
- Soon as Alan gets back with the water.
Great. We'll starve.
- We're waiting for the water.
- Oh, shit.
- Any time now, huh?
- Yeah.
Dumb. Dumb.
Jeez, you dumb shit.
- That scared the shit out of you!
- Did not.
Come on, dickface. Wait up.
- Yeah.
- All right!
Okay. Way to go.
That's way cool.
I want to try that, Vic.
All right.
Check it out.
It's the way we make the first fire.
From now on, we use kitchen matches.
Oh, look. You see up there?
We're under the sign of Otagawa.
Those four stars,
they're his hands and feet.
And the three
in the middle there...
that's his belt
with a stone knife.
That's Orion.
Shut up.
What the hell do you know?
Alan's right. That constellation
was called Orion by the Greeks.
But up here he was Otagawa...
the hunter.
See, he hunted...
not to eat but to destroy.
He was an enemy,
enemy of the land...
and of the trees.
He killed his brother,
the rabbit and the deer.
So the manitou punished him,
flung him up in the stars...
to stay up there forever alone.
Chris...
get the lantern.
- You can take his knife away.
- What do you mean?
- George?
- That's fair.
Mitch?
Well, you could give it
back to him after a while.
You gotta say something.
It's fair, right?
You gotta say it's fair.
Do you think it's fair, Alan?
Come here.
- Can you believe that?
- No.
- That's incredible.
- I don't understand how they do that.
Okay, guys, let's go.
How you doin'? It's $3.00.
It's a good month.
They got twins.
Okay, guys, this is it.
We're leaving the van
and heading out on foot.
If there's anything else
you need, get it now.
Come on, guys. Hang in there.
When we get to the falls, I'll show you
how Modoc kids used to catch fish.
There you go. Piece of cake.
Hey, guys! Let's go!
Last one across
puts up the tent!
Home run! All right! Yeah!
Cool it, asshole.
It's not over till it's over.
<i>Nice play by Carter.</i>
- It's all yours, bud.
- Fat chance. I won!
Come on. Come on!
- <i>Line drive!</i>
- You can do it! Come on!
- <i>Can't get to it.</i>
- What are you doin'?
It's just the Mets game, Vic.
They're playing San Francisco.
We've let all that go now,
haven't we?
Come on. It's the top of the ninth.
Two more outs, then we'll let go, okay?
Now!
Come on!
What are you doing?
Did you ever notice
that people in authority...
don't say what they mean?
Take Vic.
I carve my initials on a tree.
Okay, so I made a mistake.
Does Vic say, "Don't carve
your initials in the tree"?
No, he says,
"Over there's Otagawa.
They flung him into the sky.
He's an enemy of the land.
I think we'll take Alan's knife."
Now, listening to the ball game.
Vic wants to say,
"Don't listen to the radio."
Instead he says, "We've let
all that go now, haven't we?"
Obviously I hadn't.
So I go upstairs
to take a piss, right?
I look in the medicine cabinet,
and there's this round plastic box...
with numbers all around it.
- You know, the pill.
- What pill?
The pill, stupid.
So I opened it up
and I replaced every other one...
with something else.
- What?
- Vitamin C or something.
- Bullshit.
- Listen to this.
She says she's a Leo and likes
long walks in the woods and young...
- Let me see that picture again.
- What are you, a pervert?
- How many times you gotta see it?
- Hey, I thought I got it next.
- Who paid for it anyway?
- Will you just give it to me?
Didn't you say
you like to play chess?
How 'bout a game?
- Now? Out here?
- I got a travel board.
- Okay.
- All right.
Check.
- Check this out.
- Shut up.
Fine.
Damn. I took my hand off.
Now I can't move it.
It's okay.
Nah, play by the rules.
- That's mate.
- Nah.
Yeah. Checkmate.
My bishop, my rook, my queen.
What happened? Dickface win?
Yeah, dickface won.
It's not a bad run.
You just have to remember
everything I told you, okay?
Keep your center of gravity low.
Now, two of us are gonna
take the canoe down...
and the rest of you are gonna
backpack the sleeping bags and stuff.
All right, I'm gonna be in the stern,
but I need a good bow man.
- Put your helmet on.
- What?
- Me?
- Why him? Thought I'd be the one.
- What do I have to do?
- Just do your best.
Keep paddling. Pull!
- Vic, I lost my paddle!
- It's all right.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.
Oh, jeez! Better look out!
It's psychology. Vic thinks
he needs special attention.
- I think it sucks.
- This is classic.
We carry the goddamn thing,
and look who gets to ride in it.
See, Alan, it's no big deal.
Hell of a ride, huh?
What's wrong?
Don't worry about the paddle.
- You tried to scare me.
- What?
You were trying to scare me.
It's me.
What is this?
- Nobody said "take five."
- Jesus, Vic.
- Come on. Hoist that puppy.
- Give us a break.
- You lift too, Chris.
- One, two...
There you go.
Light as a feather.
Easy.
Easy.
Finally.
Don't get too comfortable.
Campsite's about a half a mile
on the other side of this gorge.
Oh, no.
Jesus.
This is something, huh?
Vic, how are we gonna get
the canoe to the other side?
We're gonna leave it here till tomorrow,
unless you wanna carry it across.
- Maybe we lucked out, and he's lost.
- Why don't you give him a break?
Up yours.
What's going on back there?
Just the unique challenge
of the great outdoors.
Shit!
- Must be 200 feet.
- Three hundred.
Made it.
Not yet you didn't.
See ya.
Let's go!
All right, guys.
Listen up. Listen up.
The first thing
you gotta remember...
is always keep one hand
on the ropes at all times.
Never let go of the ropes.
Step right in the center
of the planks.
- Move nice and slow.
- I'm scared.
I don't know if I can do this.
If the bridge starts to sway...
you just push it out
from you like that.
- That'll steady it.
- That's cool.
Fellas, do me a favor.
No screwin' around
out there, all right?
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'm gonna take the lead.
Let's get your helmets on.
You ready?
Here we go.
Come on, boys.
George, stop! I mean it!
Damn it, George. Cut it out!
It's all right, Vic.
Idiot!
All right!
Yeah!
All right!
- Way to go.
- Alan, are you okay?
- Come on, man!
- Are you scared, dickface?
- Move your ass!
- Come on, Alan!
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Are you all right? Can you do this?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I can do it.
I just got a pebble or something
stuck in my shoe.
It's no big deal.
We can wait.
No, you guys go on ahead.
I'll find you.
- I bet you he's too scared to cross.
- Why don't you leave him alone?
All right, Alan.
You come when you're ready.
The trail's real plain.
You can find it.
I'll come back for you in a little while
if you're not there.
Way to go, guys.
I'm proud of you.
<i>Now, if it's love</i>
<i>that you're runnin'from</i>
<i>There's no hidin'place</i>
<i>You can't run, you can't hide</i>
<i>Love has problems, I know</i>
<i>but those problems</i>
<i>You just have to face</i>
Come on, Alan. Move.
Move and die.
All right.
All right, I did it!
All right! All right!
I did it!
All right!
Hey, Chris.
Hurry up with that wood.
Let's go. Vic wants this tent up
before he gets back.
- Number one. Over.
- George, where'd you put the poles?
I ain't got 'em. Dickface,
where'd you put the tent poles?
The poles, stupid.
Where'd you put 'em?
Oh, shit.
- I guess I forgot 'em.
- You forgot 'em?
I can't even believe this.
You believe this?
I can believe it.
I'm sleeping in your tent, asshole.
- You know we needed those poles.
- Where'd you put 'em?
- How can you be so stupid?
- Where did you leave 'em?
Tell me where you left 'em!
Cool it.
- He forgot the poles.
- All right, all right.
- Alan, you left the poles behind?
- I know it was stupid.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Do you remember?
Sure.
Right by the bridge,
on the other side.
Just have to go back
and get 'em.
- You mean now?
- He's too scared.
Shut up.
Better get going, Alan.
It's only a half a mile each way.
But it's gonna get dark.
It's your responsibility
to go back and get those poles.
That's fair.
- You left 'em, right?
- Right.
Supper will be ready
when you get back.
Come on.
Look out.
You just knocked my onion off.
Well, keep your
goddamn kabob off mine.
Where the hell are the poles?
Couldn't find them.
I looked everywhere.
- You gotta be shittin' me.
- Hey, I said I looked everywhere!
- What, they walk away or something?
- Jesus, Alan.
It was dark, okay?
Find yourself a stick, Alan.
Get yourself something to eat.
Turn the radio off.
Turn it off.
What did I tell you
about that thing?
I guess I didn't get your point.
You didn't get the point.
All right.
Here's the point.
I said no.
When I say no, I mean no.
This is not a vacation.
This is a chance for you
to learn something.
We've got a couple more weeks together.
I wanna get a few things straight.
There'll be no more radio.
You understand?
And no more lying.
What are you talking about?
The tent poles.
I was there.
I saw what happened.
You never crossed the bridge.
You were afraid.
- You saw me?
- You cannot lie.
You cannot lie to me.
You saw me?
This is crazy.
You must be crazy.
I don't want to hear
that radio again.
Different people have different ideas
about what's dangerous and what's not.
Let me show you something.
You figure it out for yourself.
This bridge is 5 feet off the ground,
and the real one was 182.
The density of this eggshell relative
to the drop-off of this model...
is comparable to
the density of my head...
off the drop of the real bridge.
You're just gonna have to
trust me on that. Now, watch.
Uh-oh. Trouble.
I rest my case.
- You guys are hopeless.
- Chris, you got your knife.
Hey, why don't you
come back in here?
- I proved my point.
- Shut up, guys!
You still owe me two bucks
for that last one.
Yeah, right.
You gotta use your hands.
You gotta use a net. You suck.
Where'd he go?
- I got one.
- Help me.
- Come see what we caught, man.
- Hey, my fish!
How did we do, guys?
Good. I got one,
but it's big, though.
He ain't that big.
I got two. Check 'em out.
Frogs.
I struck out, man.
Holy shit!
Look at dickface.
All right, man.
- Way to go, man.
- Good job.
- Some haul, Alan.
- I really feel one with nature today.
- Must be six or seven in there.
- I can't even believe that.
- How'd you do it?
- No big deal.
It's really simple.
They swim through the chute.
The trap closes,
and they can't get out.
Pretty neat, huh?
I rigged it up myself.
No, I don't think that's neat.
What do you guys think?
Hey, wait a second.
I caught those.
No, you didn't, not the right way.
You mean your way.
I mean the right way.
You're a smart kid, Alan,
but you really let me down this time.
You let yourself down.
You clean the fish that Chris and I
caught before we leave the island.
Then we can forget
your little trick.
- I could help him.
- No, this is Alan's job.
Come here. I'll show you.
Nothin' to it.
All right?
All you have to do is gut it.
Nothin' to it.
Why don't you clean the rest of these,
and we'll finish loading up the canoe.
No way.
You'll do it, and you're gonna
stay here until it's finished.
Let's go, guys.
Mitch, let's go.
Signal when you're finished, Alan.
We'll come back and get you.
Come and get it, Mitch!
We'll just wait for Alan's signal.
Come on, guys. Get up.
Let's go.
It's morning. Come on.
Can't be. Not yet.
Come on, Mitch.
Come on. Let's get up.
Come on. Let's go.
Soon as you're up, I want you to go
over to the island and get Alan.
- Us?
- You.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
Come on. Let's go this way.
I hope he's all right.
Hope he's not dead.
Alan, where the hell are you?
- Say something.
- I'm over here.
- Where?
- Where are you?
Jesus. You must have
froze your balls off.
Here, my mom always
stuffs 'em in my pockets.
- Where's the fish?
- I threw 'em back.
- You what?
- Why didn't you just clean the fish?
- I didn't want to.
- Vic's gonna be really pissed.
Come on. Let's go.
- I don't get it. We looked everywhere.
- I don't know where the hell he is.
Will you shut up?
- Get the ranger's station on that.
- What do you think I'm trying to do?
- Is it too far away?
- It shouldn't be.
I pick up satellite
transmissions at home.
You're full of shit.
- You got batteries in it?
- I got power.
I just can't tune anything in.
Something with the condenser.
I went all the way over to the bend.
I didn't see a thing.
- What are we gonna do?
- Will you just shut up, please?
Is that all you can say?
Why did he leave us here?
He didn't.
Look, his pack is still here.
He wouldn't go anywhere
without his pack.
- What if he doesn't come back for it?
- Shut up, or I'm gonna shut you up!
Who the hell
elected you king shit?
Sucking around Vic all the time.
You don't know what to do, where we are.
Go ahead, wiseass.
Do something!
- Go to hell!
- Hey, cut it out!
Cool it!
- Dirty mother...
- Come on, George!
I'm gonna kill you!
Gonna rip your face off!
Stop!
Get off!
Chris, cool it!
- Is that thing gonna work, dickface?
- Don't call me that, damn it.
- Right. Give me that.
- Give it back to him, man!
- You want it, dickface?
- Yeah, give it.
I'll give it to you.
It didn't work anyways.
Move it!
Hey, let me in, guys!
Get in here.
This stuff tastes like shit.
Should have cooked it.
You want to go build a fire?
Go ahead, asshole.
1,001, 1,002...
- Will you cut it out?
- 1,003, 1,004...
- Mile and a half.
- He's dead.
- Shut up!
- What are we gonna do if he's dead?
- Will you shut up already?
- He wouldn't leave us here. He's dead.
He didn't leave us. He's just...
- 1,001, 1,002, 1,003...
- Jesus Christ! Cut it out!
- Shit. This thing's dripping on me.
- Don't touch it.
- Don't touch that.
- Touch what?
- Goddamn it!
- Where are we gonna go?
Where are you guys goin'?
- Damn it!
- Follow me.
- Shit!
- That way.
- Come on.
- Where are you guys taking me?
I don't know.
- Just keep going.
- Slow down!
Keep going.
- I can't see anything.
- Neither can I.
Watch out, man.
I gotta rest.
- Stop!
- Me too.
Stop it!
- Wait a minute. Look!
- What?
Looks like a cave or something.
Follow me.
- Where?
- I can't see anything.
- Over here.
- Go.
Watch it.
- Man, I'm soaking wet. Move over.
- I found this place. You move over.
- We should have brought a flashlight.
- I did.
What are you saving it for,
an emergency?
There's gotta be fungus in here.
Lizards and spiders.
Wait.
There's something wrong
with the batteries.
- These matches might still be dry.
- Come on. Get them lit!
What do you think
I'm trying to do?
Christ, man. Hurry!
- Shit!
- Give me these!
- We gotta get 'em lit.
- George, calm down.
We got 'em wet!
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Cut it out!
I just want to go home.
- Just take it easy.
- Give me that.
Listen...
I know I kind of lost it
last night.
But I'm not normally like that.
It's all right.
Thanks.
Look, Alan.
Sorry about your radio.
- I'll buy you another one.
- Forget it.
- You think he'll come back?
- Who cares?
Who cares? How are we
gonna get home?
The only thing I care about
is that I haven't peed in two days.
- I second that.
- Wait up. I'm right behind you.
Hey, bet you can't hit that log.
Go ahead.
Now, watch this.
Survey says...
it's a dribble.
- Make room.
- For what?
For Tony the trouser tuna.
It's almost coming out.
Oh, watch your shoes.
- That's amazing!
- Piece of cake.
- That is incredible.
- Nice projection.
- Nice arc, Alan.
- My friends call me dickface.
Dickface.
You having fun, fellas?
- Vic! What's up?
- What's happening?
- Where you been?
- Hey, all right!
- What's happening?
- Where you been?
- You know, how'd it go?
- Where were you?
It's not important now.
What's important is that you guys
made it on your own. You survived!
I'm proud of you guys.
I really am.
- Now you're ready.
- Ready for what?
Devil's Tooth.
I've got a problem
right about now.
I remember that Vic left us
in the pouring rain...
George freaked out, and Chris...
let's just say he overreacted.
So you tell me why I'm the only one
not jumpin' up and down...
when our fearless leader returns.
Are we men, or are we...
We know what Vic thought, but...
here's one he didn't count on.
Now we go on line.
Make sure it stays locked.
- Secure?
- All right, guys.
Remember what Vic said.
Keep some slack.
Why don't you
just worry about yourself?
That won't cut it.
We're on this line together.
Jesus.
Looks like we've run out of road.
- Chris, I'm gonna need your help.
- Sure.
Hold this.
He just changed his shoes, now he's
putting weird things in the rocks.
- What do you think it means?
- I think it means we're in deep shit.
- On belay.
- Belay on.
- What's happening? Where is he?
- He's workin'.
What happens if he falls?
He ain't gonna fall.
Christ. Where is he?
- I wish I knew where he was.
- I don't.
All right!
- Did he make it?
- Of course he made it.
- Okay, I'm gonna set a pivot.
- Okay!
We don't do it that way, do we?
We're gonna pendulum across.
- What the hell's that?
- You'll see.
- Keep me on tension.
- All right.
- All right.
- Nice to have you back.
- You got me?
- Yeah.
Here goes.
Damn! Jesus!
What happened?
All right, now.
Just keep me on belay.
I'm gonna anchor in.
- Is that what you meant?
- Yup.
- You ready, Chris?
- Ready.
Remember, drop way off from the rocks
so you get a good swing on the rope.
- Right. Here I come.
- Okay.
- All right. Way to go.
- I did it! George, you'll love it!
It's great!
Okay, George.
You're up.
- Got it.
- All right!
It's great!
You're gonna love it!
Make sure your carabiner's locked.
Put the sling over your shoulder.
Guess this is supposed
to make me safe, huh?
Guess so.
- Here I come.
- You know what to do.
- All right.
- I did it!
- I made it!
- Yeah, you did.
I'm scared, Mitch.
Me too.
- I'm scared Vic's gonna hurt me.
- Next victim!
That's you, Mitch!
- We're rolling.
- Yeah, let's go!
Nice catch, Mitch.
Same thing, Mitch.
Make sure you're locked.
Don't forget the sling.
- You're gonna love it, Mitch!
- Ready.
Okay, Mitch.
Get a good kick off the rock.
All right!
Hey, Alan, man,
there's nothing to it!
Really, man, honest!
Nothing to it.
It's hot, huh?
You don't have to do a thing, Alan.
Just trust me.
Yeah, right.
- Nice grab.
- All right.
- You're really gonna like it, Alan.
- Move it, man.
- You ready?
- Oh, Christ. Oh, God.
- You ready?
- Oh, Christ. Oh, God.
- Alan, what's wrong?
- It's great, man. Do it. Really.
It's honestly great!
Come on, Alan. I know you're afraid.
That's nothin' to be ashamed of.
- I'm not afraid.
- You can do it.
- I can't.
- I know you can.
Come on! Come on!
Trust yourself!
Come on! Do it, man!
There's no other way.
You gotta do it.
- You gotta do it, Alan!
- Do it, will ya?
- Vic, please.
- Alan, do it.
- Do it! Goddamn it, do it!
- No! Help!
- Vic, do something!
- Grab something!
- What are you gonna do?
- It's all right. I got him on belay.
- But he could...
- It's all right. I got him.
Please.
- Pull me up, please.
- It's okay, Alan.
Just relax. Come on. It's okay.
- Can you get a foothold?
- No, I can't.
Try. Get a foothold and just
push yourself off from the rock.
- I can't do it. I can't. Help me.
- Try a little harder.
Why don't you just go out there
and get him? Swing over.
Not that way.
Alan, I know you can do this.
- I can't!
- I got you anchored.
- You're not gonna fall.
- Vic, I can't do this.
You can if you try.
For Christ's sake, Vic. I can't do it.
Don't you understand? I can't do it.
- Then that's where you'll stay.
- What?
Vic, what do you mean?
You can't just leave him there.
- You can't just let him hang like that.
- We'll meet you down below.
- Vic, where are you goin'?
- He said he couldn't do it.
- The guy is scared to death.
- You can't just let him hang there.
- You can't just leave me here!
- You can't, Vic! You're crazy!
- What if he falls?
- He could die out there.
- Come on.
- Vic, where you going?
- I'm telling you the truth. I'm scared.
- Move it.
Don't leave without me.
Please. No.
Don't leave, Mitch.
Let's go!
- You're not just gonna leave him?
- Yeah, I am.
- For how long?
- It's up to Alan.
- But, Vic, he's scared. He can't just...
- He can if he tries.
- What if he doesn't try?
- Come on, Vic.
Can't you just
get him down this once?
Someday I'm not gonna be there to
get him down. Then what's he gonna do?
- Why are you doing this?
- I am not doing anything.
Alan is doing this to himself. Now,
is that a problem for you, Chris?
Yeah, it is a problem.
I'm going back.
This is not acceptable behavior.
Is that clear?
We'll camp here for the night.
Okay with you guys?
All right. Do it.
The way I figure it, we won't
go back to the old campsite downstream.
We'll go north.
We'll follow the great bear.
You were wrong,
what you did to Alan, Vic.
He's right, man. You must be crazy
leavin' him up there.
- Yeah. Yeah, we'll go north.
- I don't know why you're doing this...
What's that?
- It's Alan! You did it!
- Son of a bitch.
- You did it, man!
- Way to go, Alan! You did it!
- All right! Way to go, man!
- Unbelievable!
All right! Way to go!
Are you all right?
I don't believe it.
- I knew you could do i...
- I'm going home.
Wait. You can't. You don't understand.
Don't you see? You did great!
I knew you would. Don't you see that?
We're all together again. We did it!
- Yeah, I did. Fuck you. I could've died.
- He's right, man.
Alan, you don't understand.
None of that matters now. Look at you.
Look at what you did.
You made it. I did that for you.
- I'm going home.
- Me too, Vic. You gotta take us home.
- We wanna go home!
- What's the matter with you guys?
You don't wanna miss tomorrow. We're
goin' north. I can show you wolves.
- I can show you mountain lion.
- Bye, Vic.
Wait, wait, wait.
Where you gonna go?
It's gonna get dark.
You need me. You'll never
get down the mountain by yourselves.
- I don't care. I'm goin' home.
- No, you're not!
- I'm responsible for you g...
- We're goin' home, Vic!
You can't. You can't.
You understand? You can't leave.
- Go. Get out of here.
- Chris, what are you doin'?
You can't leave. We're a team.
Do you hear me?
You can't leave me.
- We've been walkin' for hours.
- 'Cause we've been walkin' in circles.
It's too dark. We gotta camp.
- I think I like that plan.
- Yeah.
Think we'll ever get out of here?
I can't believe Vic did this.
How could he?
How could he do this?
Look.
Yeah.
Told you I'd find it.
We did it! The canoe!
We actually found the canoe!
You did it, Alan! All right!
- We made it!
- All right!
We're awesome!
Let's get this mother home!
All right!
We're homeward bound!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- All right!
- Yeah!
All right. That's it!
This thing is over now!
Nobody is going anywhere!
- Vic, please. Leave us alone.
- No!
- You are not leaving.
- Damn it, Vic. We're goin' home.
No, you're not! You are not going home.
I am not gonna let you.
Leave him alone!
Stop, Vic!
Stop! I'm gonna kill you, Vic.
- Stay away from us!
- Chris, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Chris, stop!
Get him!
- No! Let go!
- Give me that!
Son of a bitch!
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God!
All right. Good. More slack.
Good. Hold it.
That's good.
- Put some in that pocket there.
- There you go, guys.
This is never gonna work.
Yes, it will.
Shut up and get the other pack.
You got it? Okay.
Get it around you!
Put the rope underneath your arms!
Come on. Hurry up, you guys.
All right. Good and tight.
Hurry up, Vic!
Good! Now hold on. Let's go.
All right.
You okay?
Help me, George.
Easy, easy.
He's almost here.
Hold on, man. You're all right.
He's almost here. Here. Hold me.
Hold me. It's all right.
Give me your hand.
I got him.
Here.
- I'll get the first-aid stuff.
- Hurry.
- Jeez, he looks awful.
- Yeah.
I'd better stay with him while
you guys go downriver for help.
We'll just leave him here,
and we'll send help back for him.
- Somebody's gotta stay with him.
- Alan, he left you!
I don't care.
It's not the same thing. He's hurt.
How the hell are we
gonna find the ranger station?
- You'll find it.
- You figure the river'll lead us down?
Yeah. Just remember
to keep the sun to your left.
All right. We'll get someone here
as soon as we can.
Put that over him.
All you have to do
is hike downstream.
You'll reach the ranger station
by tomorrow.
- Sure you'll be all right?
- Yeah. I'm sure.
We're out of here.
Good luck, Alan, huh?
- See you soon, all right?
- Yeah. Bye.
The others went for help.
You know, that thing you rigged,
it saved my life.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Makin' fire.
- Yeah.
How come you're doin' it that way?
I thought you hated all that stuff.
Well, we sort of lost the matches.
- This wasn't on the itinerary.
- First light, we're takin' the river.
I thought
you said help was comin'.
Change of plans.
Alan, you can't take the canoe.
It's too dangerous.
You don't know how to...
- We'll just wait here for help.
- We can't. Your leg is broken.
You're losin' a ton of blood.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Don't worry, Vic!
You're coming around!
Reach out! I got you!
Put out your arm!
Reach! Right here.
Hold on. You got it.
Pull.
Hell of a ride, huh?
Remind me to put it
on the tour next year.
How's your leg?
It's been numb most of the way.
Oh, man. What you did
back there was brave.
- That took guts.
- I didn't do this 'cause I wanted to.
It wasn't fun,
and I wouldn't do it again.
I mean, what's the point?
We didn't make it anyway.
The point is you made it
down that river.
I was trying to get you to a doctor.
I don't give a shit about the river.
You are the most stubborn
son of a bitch.
Except maybe for you.
How did your father ever talk you
into coming this summer?
I was young.
It won't happen again.
It's our ride home! We made it!
Yeah!
<i>Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.</i>
You hear music, you see credits,
you think it's over?
I gotta tell you what happened
to Chris, Mitch and George.
They made it to the ranger station,
grumbling about bad directions.
What did I know? I was in charge.
I had to say something.
I made my peace with Vic,
and I learned something too.
Everybody needs a time of isolation,
time to be one with nature.
So every year I come to these woods...
to contemplate my place
in the universe...
fish, live off the land.
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>
<i>I've lost my mind.</i>
<i>After all this</i>...
<i>the bridge, the cliff,</i>
<i>the group pee...</i>
<i>the boat over the waterfall</i>...
<i>and now I come back to the woods?</i>
<i>Not this puppy.</i>
