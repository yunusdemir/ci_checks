Snug, I'm calling
in a solid you owe me.
- What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?
Let me think.
lsland approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.
VFR on top. Over.
lsland tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner
requesting vectors to the initial.
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.
At the same time. Yeah.
You sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible".
I was right to idolize you.
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!
I'm still geeking out about it!
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."
Lame, lame, lame.
- All right, who did you contact?
- Contact? What are you talking about?
I am referring to last night
at 2307 hours
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.
I didn't know about the homing device.
And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.
- Who did you contact?
- I didn't send for a plane.
Play the transmission.
- India golf checking in.
- Helen!
So you do know these people.
Well, then, I'll send them
a little greeting.
- Ow!
- Violet!
It's not my fault.
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.
That's not true!
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what.
- ...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!
All right, well, who'd you get?
You don't have to worry
about one thing.
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.
Kari...
The beauty is they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!
I wish my parents played Mozart
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.
Who can handle it?
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard.
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.
Repeat, disengage.
Friendlies...
No! Call off the missiles.
I'll do anything.
Too late. Fifteen years too late.
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.
Angels 10. Track east. Disengage.
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.
You said not to use our powers.
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!
- Mom?
- Violet!
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!
There are children aboard.
- There are children aboard!
- No!
- Put a field around us now!
- I've never done one that big.
Do it now!
Abort, abort, abort!
Abort, abort, abort!
Brace yourselves!
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.
We're not gonna panic,
we're not... Look out!
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?
We're dead! We're dead!
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!
Stop it!
We are not gonna die!
Both of you will get a grip.
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month!
Understand?
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.
Ah, you'll get over it.
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone".
Release me. Now!
- Or what?
- I'll crush her.
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.
Show me.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Even when you have nothing to lose.
You're weak.
And I've outgrown you.
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.
That way is our best bet.
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?
I expect you to trust me.
What a trooper.
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, Mom.
I think your father is in trouble.
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.
I'm going to look for him.
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.
- What?
- You heard her.
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.
Protect it.
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!
Remember the bad guys on those shows
you used to watch on Saturday mornings?
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.
They will kill you
if they get the chance.
Do not give them that chance.
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.
Mom!
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.
Shh. It isn't your fault.
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.
But things are different now.
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.
You have more power than you realize.
Don't think. And don't worry.
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.
It's in your blood.
He's not weak, you know.
What?
Valuing life is not weakness.
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,
I had everything under control.
And disregarding it is not strength.
I called his bluff, sweetheart,
that's all.
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!
Okay, okay, okay.
A rocket?
Hey!
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.
What do you think is going on here?
You think we're on vacation?
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.
Or worse, their marriage.
Their marriage?
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.
Forget it. You're so immature.
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.
I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh.
Cool!
Cool!
Roger.
We are ready for launch.
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?
ETA two-niner. Over.
TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.
Not responding to IFF.
IRCM reads negative.
- Bob.
- What?
I didn't say anything.
Identification, please.
- Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look.
- What?
- It talks!
- What?
There. That one.
Voice key incorrect.
- "Voice key"?
- Voice key incorrect.
Wait a second.
- What do we do?
- Run!
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!
Intruder alert.
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.
In fact, there's no time at all.
- Please...
- Why are you here?
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?
Family survived the crash.
- They're here on the island!
- They're alive?
- Helen?
- Hello.
You must be Mrs...
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.
That's what I was doing.
Let go of me!
Let go, you lousy, lying,
unfaithful creep!
How could I betray the perfect woman?
- Oh, you're referring to me now?
- Where are the kids?
- They triggered the alert.
- What?
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.
- Think they're supers?
- Dash, remember what Mom said.
- What?
- Stop talking!
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!
- What?
- Run!
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!
Show yourself!
Hey!
Ha, ha!
I'm alive. Yeah!
Uh-oh.
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.
But I didn't want you to worry.
You didn't want me to worry?
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.
You can't hide from me.
- There you are.
- Hey!
Don't touch my sister!
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!
Whatever you do, don't stop!
Mom! Dad! Hey!
Kids.
- You're all right.
- You're all right.
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.
I love you.
- Wow.
- Whoa.
Time out!
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?
Oh, no! Elastigirl?
You married Elastigirl? Whoa!
And got busy!
It's a whole family of supers.
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!
Oh, this is just too good!
- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.
I'll give them heroics.
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.
And when everyone's super...
...no one will be.
Fire at will!
It's overwhelming the tanks.
I'm sorry.
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?
Shh. Don't interrupt.
So caught up in the past that I...
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today
but I think it's time we wind down now.
We need to get back to the mainland.
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.
Where are all the guards?
Go, go!
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?
How about a rocket?
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.
- How do I get into the computer?
- Say please.
- Honey?
- What?
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?
Where is my supersuit?
- I put it away.
- Where?
Why do you need to know?
I need it!
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.
We've been planning
this dinner for two months!
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.
"Greater good"? I am your wife!
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!
Run!
My baby!
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!
All right, stand back.
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.
Ha, ha!
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.
How you doing, honey?
Do I have to answer?
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.
Here we go, honey.
Ready, Violet? Ready?
Now!
This is gonna be rough.
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.
Get in the right lane! Signal!
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!
Is everybody okay back there?
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.
While what?
I watch helplessly from the sidelines?
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.
I'm with you for better or worse.
I have to do this alone.
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!
- Then what?
- I'm not...
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?
I can't lose you again!
I can't. Not again.
I'm not... strong enough.
If we work together,
you won't have to be.
I don't know what'll happen.
We're superheroes.
What can happen?
Vi! Dash! No!
Violet?
- Dad!
- Go, go!
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?
Frozone!
Yeah!
Bob!
Hey!
Syndrome's remote!
The remote controls the robot!
- Throw it, throw it!
- Go long!
Got it!
Honey, take out its guns!
Gotcha!
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!
A remote? A remote that controls what?
The robot?
It's coming back!
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is...
...itself.
It's getting closer!
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!
It's not doing anything.
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.
Honey!
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!
- No, the other one! The first one!
- First button! Got it!
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.
- Press the button!
- Not yet!
- Hang on!
- What are you waiting for?
A closer target! You got one shot!
Everybody duck!
Hey, Zone.
Huh? No!
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.
Yeah. Hurt then too.
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.
The people of this country
are indebted to you.
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?
Let the politicians figure that one out.
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.
You did good, Bob.
Hi, this is Kari.
I have a question about Jack-Jack...
Come on. We're in a limo.
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?
- Yeah, I just... yeah.
- It looks good.
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!
Not as cool as you running on water.
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- It's me.
Jack-Jack is fine,
but weird things are happening.
Jack-Jack's still fine,
but I'm getting really weirded out!
When are you coming back?
...aced those guys
that tried to kill us!
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.
I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.
I need help, Mrs...
Bob, listen to this.
I'm gonna call the police...
Hi, this is Kari.
Sorry for freaking out,
but your baby has special needs.
Thanks for sending a replacement.
I didn't call a replacement.
Shh. The baby is sleeping.
You took away my future.
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.
What's happening?
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.
Throw me.
Bob, throw me!
No!
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.
I'll get your son!
Oh, no.
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.
Everything is all right.
That's my girl.
Does this mean we have to move again?
Oh, man.
That was totally wicked!
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.
I feel different. Is different okay?
Hey, different is...
Different is great.
Would you...
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...
- ...you and I...
- Yeah?
- Do you...
- Shh.
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!
Come on, run! Pick up the pace.
Run!
Move it, move it!
Pace it.
Slow down just a little bit.
- Make it close!
- Second.
Close second, yeah!
That's my boy!
Dash, I'm so proud of you.
I didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.
Behold the Underminer!
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me!
I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!
Soon all will tremble before me!
