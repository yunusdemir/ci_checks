That's a first down.
Huskie ball at the 35-yard line.
Touchdown! Paul Taylor.
17-yard pass from Terry Stokes.
Look at her, man, look at her!
I think she wants your body.
- You gotta ask her out, Paul.
- Isn't she datin' Pulver?
Yeah, but that's goin' nowhere.
Take a shot, for Christ's sake.
- God.
- Hey, I'm gonna ask her out.
- Bullshit. When, when, when?
- When the timing's right.
- Yeah, right.
- Timing's everything.
No-no-no-no. Hit him! Hit him!
- Yeah! All right!
- Whoo-hoo!
Wildcat fumble,
Huskie ball. First and 10.
Go, Wildcats, let's go!
Seven-yard pass,
complete to Paul Taylor.
Meg, got any plans this evening?
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Looks like the game put
you outta business.
Don't worry. When they're through
screamin' their heads off,
they'll be in here like a flood.
More iced tea?
Please.
It's good that this town's got up
on its hind legs about somethin'.
Well, it takes people's
minds off their troubles.
It's been a lean year for most folks.
Well, ski season's about to start.
There'll be tourists.
You know, there's a new band
out at the Tin Palace tonight.
- Is that right?
- Supposed to be pretty good.
That's nice.
You like country music?
Herb, are you askin' me out?
Yeah, well, I... I guess I am, yeah.
I don't know. I'm kinda stuck here.
You know, I gotta earn a livin'.
Yeah. Yeah, it must be
tough tryin' to get away.
Shoot. George, here they come.
- That my check?
- Mm-hmm.
Now, if you do get any
free time to yourself,
that's my number there
down at the station.
Okay.
Okay, okay. One at a time.
Flagg, congratulations.
For what?
Well, I hear you have
a birthday comin' up.
- No more juvie hall, right?
- Yeah, right.
Now, you mess up now,
and you're in the majors.
I'll see ya around, Flagg.
Moss, what's happening?
You look like hell.
Hey, it's a fashion statement, man.
Only statement them clothes
got to make is, "I look like hell."
My bike's broken down
at Elkin's Grove.
I was thinkin', uh, maybe I
could borrow your ratchet set?
The Summit's got me
overhauling six damn Ski-Docs,
three Cats, and two flatbed
snowmakers... by Monday.
What's the hurry? It must
be 70 degrees out there.
It's injun summer, boy.
Before you know it,
winter gonna be tear-assin' through
this town with no apologies.
Aw, come on. It barely pissed
snow the last couple years.
This whole town's ready to fold.
Yeah, well, see,
this year's gonna be different.
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm. Take my word.
You're gonna wish your piece
of shit excuse for a motorcycle
was one of these sweet little rigs.
So, uh, Moss, how 'bout the ratchet?
All right, maybe I'll put in a
couple hours over the weekend,
maybe that'll light things up a bit.
There's 12 sockets
in that set... 12...
and they better all be there
when I get it back too.
You got it, buddy. You got it.
Thanks a lot, Moss.
Hey, I owe ya one.
You owe me too damn many.
Oh, bombs away!
What the...
Holy cow!
Uh, lend me five bucks
just till tomorrow, okay?
What for?
You know, you're not the only
one with a date tonight, pal.
I'm gonna score with Vicki tonight. I want
to invest in a little protection. Come on.
- Let's go, boys. It's closing time.
- All right. Here.
- Thanks.
- Make it quick.
Uh, look, pal. Give me a pack
of Trojans and a Binaca spray.
- Scott Jeskey.
- Reverend.
Good game today!
Uh, thanks. Thanks, Reverend.
How are ya?
Well, my hay fever's acting
up a little bit, but I'll live.
Yeah.
Haven't seen you at the
Sunday services lately.
- Oh. Yeah, well, I...
- You want the ribbed or the regular?
Ribbed, I-I guess.
They're not for me, you know.
- They're for my friend.
- Oh?
There's this-this-this sort of
naive girl that he's planning on...
Well, you know. And, uh, I insisted
that he take precautions.
Why doesn't he pay for them?
I had to drag him down here as it is.
The guy is totally irresponsible.
Hey, come on, Scott. What's the holdup?
I can't keep this girl waiting.
The boy doesn't need condoms.
He needs a muzzle.
Kevin, don't eat with your face.
Mom, we're in a hurry.
We're gonna go bowling with Anthony.
And then to the movies. Ow!
- What movie?
- Garden Tool Massacre.
- It's your basic slice-and-dice.
- Your basic what?
Well, this guy in a hockey mask,
he chops up a few teenagers.
But don't worry.
There's no sex or anything bad.
They won't let you kids
into a movie like that.
No problem. My brother's an usher.
No. Absolutely not.
- Mom, come on.
- Kevin!
I will not have you seeing that
kind of trash, and that's final.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.
Mom, have you seen my pink sweater?
Uh, it's on the hamper, honey.
I meant to talk to you about that.
- Why did you do that?
- What did I do?
We, uh, had a little accident.
- What happened?
- It got mixed up in the wash.
Interesting look.
Why don't you wear
my cashmere sweater?
- Are you serious?
- Sure.
Oh, my God, that's him.
- What do you want?
- Hi. I'm here to see Meg.
- What for?
- Uh, just to see her.
- Is she home?
- Just a minute.
I'm terribly sorry. You must be Paul.
- I'm Meg's mother.
- Hi. Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Well, come on in.
Meg'll be right down.
- Uh, where do you think you're going?
- Sleeping over at Eddie's.
Oh, right. But you're not going
anywhere without your jacket.
Oh, Mom, it's boiling out.
Well, it's October. It's nighttime.
You're wearing your jacket.
- Stupid coat.
- No, here, let me.
- Okay. Bye-bye, honey. Enjoy yourself.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Eddie.
- Oh, yeah.
Won't you sit down?
Oh, excuse me.
- Hi, Paul.
- Hi.
- Are you surviving my family so far?
- Yeah. You look great.
- Thank you.
- You wanna go?
Sure. I just want you to
meet my dad really quick.
- It'll just take a second.
- Sure.
Daddy, I'd like you to
meet my friend Paul.
Ribbed.
Hey!
I'm really sorry about my dad.
I've never seen him like that before.
Th-That's okay.
It was just a misunderstanding.
I've made better first
impressions though. That's for sure.
- Well, no harm done, I guess.
- No, wrong.
Scott Jeskey is gonna die.
Paul, watch out!
Flagg! Jesus Christ!
- What did you do to him?
- Hey, I'm not the one
- who bounced him off my car, pal.
- Yeah, right. You ran him in the road!
- Stop it! Let's get him to a doctor.
- Hey, watch out.
He's got some kind of
corrosive shit on his hand.
Come on. Take it easy, mister.
We're gonna get some help, all right?
Let's go. Come on.
- The sky. It fell from the sky.
- What's he sayin'?
He's in shock. Let's just go.
Hey! Get in the car.
What for?
There's gonna be a lot of explaining
to do, and you're part of it.
Now, are you gonna get in the car,
or am I gonna make you get in?
What's the matter, Taylor?
You worried about a little insurance
claim on Daddy's car, huh?
Maybe I will come along...
just to make sure you don't
blame this whole thing on me.
Are you two finished?
Whenever you're ready.
Right here.
- Excuse me, Nurse?
- One moment, please.
- Now, how may I help you?
- We've had a car accident.
This guy needs to see a doctor.
He has something on his hand too...
some kind of acid or something.
Does he have Blue Cross?
- I don't know.
- Medical insurance of any kind?
- I don't believe this shit.
- Look, we don't even know who the guy is.
The doctor's with another
patient right now.
Could you put this gentleman
in room three, please?
You'll have to fill these out.
Okay. Come on, up. Up.
Hey, take it easy, old dude.
These guys are gonna
fix you right up.
Hey, where you goin'?
These people don't give
a shit about explanations.
If you need me,
you know where to find me.
I bet you've had better
first dates, huh?
I don't mind.
Want a soda?
Yeah, sure. That'd be great.
Something diet.
Absolutely. At this point the
prognosis is very positive.
In cases like this,
the question is always the
quality of physical therapy.
The follow-up to any operation
is to a great extent...
Doctor, come in here quickly!
- I'm with a patient...
- There's a man dying in here! Hurry!
Excuse me a moment.
Is this the hand injury?
- What is this?
- That thing on his hand.
Nurse!
- Sheriff's Department.
- Get me the sheriff! It's an emergency.
Paul?
- Geller speaking.
- Sheriff, this is Paul Taylor.
- Paul, what's wrong?
- I'm at the Arborville Hospital.
An old man's just been
killed down here.
- You said "killed"?
- Yes, sir.
Okay, you sit tight. I'll be right down.
Now, who else is involved?
I'm with Meg Penny, and Brian
Flagg was here earlier.
Flagg? Where is he now?
Paul?
Paul!
But I did see it, Dad.
It killed Paul.
- Shh.
- Sheriff.
How 'bout it, Herb?
Can we take her home now?
Yeah, you may as well, Tom.
Make sure she gets a good sleep, huh?
We're not gonna get anything out
of her tonight. She's hysterical.
I got a call in to Paul Taylor's folks.
They haven't heard from him.
Well, let's face it, Bill.
They're not going to.
You get that to Sacramento tonight.
I want the autopsy pronto, not next week.
- "Jesus wept."
- Herb, you okay?
Taylor was a good kid.
I want the son of a
bitch who did this.
Maybe we already got him.
Scott, cut it out. I told you.
Come on, Vicki. You're wearin'
my ring. That makes you my girl.
Doesn't that count
for something, huh?
Hey, what are all those
lights down there?
Isn't that the hospital?
Yeah. It's probably a
promotional gimmick.
They're giving away free
tonsillectomies or something.
Say, young lady, I think you're about ready
for another one of my famous cherry coolers.
- I think I've had enough.
- Nonsense. You've never had enough.
My very own blend of
special imported liqueurs.
<i>And you feel my love</i>
<i>All my love</i>
<i>Tonight</i>
Vicki?
Okay.
It's like a steam bath in here.
Here's your drink, Vicki.
Vicki?
Yep.
Hot as a dog out there tonight.
Vicki?
That's, uh...
That's a nice blouse.
Nice material.
Must be hot though, huh? Yeah.
I'll... I'll just undo
one of these for you.
Ah. That's better, huh?
Oh, no? Oh, well,
I'll... I'll just...
I'll undo another one then.
There! Okay.
Vicki!
I knew I shouldn't have let her go out
with the son of a bitch in the first place!
Lower your voice.
That poor boy's probably dead.
I wanna know what happened
out there tonight.
Whatever it was, you can bet
that Flagg kid was behind it.
It's about time they nailed
that little psychopath.
His ass is gonna fry
this time, believe me.
- Here. Take this.
- I don't want it.
No, come on, honey.
You have to get some sleep.
That's my good girl.
Now, just... let it alone.
I'm sure that the police will have this
whole thing settled by the morning.
Come on.
Mom?
You don't believe me either, do you?
You're home now. You're safe.
That's all that matters.
Look at him. He's too stupid to
know how much trouble he's in.
Why don't you wise up?
I told you everything. I'm gettin'
tired of hearing myself talk.
We're not boring you, are we...
a bright kid like you?
Hey, am I under arrest?
Because if I am, I want a lawyer.
- Man wants a lawyer.
- Yeah, that's right.
And if you're not bookin' me,
I'd like to leave.
- Either way, I want you outta my face.
- Oh, yeah, hard-ass?
Well, I'm in your face to stay.
What are you gonna do about it?
- Go ahead, hit me!
- Bill.
Go ahead.
Any luck with his mama?
- I can't seem to find her.
- That's not unusual, is it?
She takes little vacations with
her pal Johnnie Walker Red
and anyone else who
happens to be around.
Of course, we could call his dad,
if anyone knew who he was.
Hey, call a shrink. I'm a broken man.
You think this is a joke?
Turn him loose.
Herb, we got eyewitnesses placing
him at the scene of the crime.
No motive, no evidence.
He hasn't got a drop of blood on him.
Hell, Flagg's a punk,
but he's no killer.
- I think it's a mistake.
- Well, your objection is duly noted.
Now, turn him loose.
We got work to do.
Go on.
Take a hike.
Brian, I need to talk to you.
- Brian.
- What the hell are you doin' here?
Look, I came down to bail you out.
What do you think they are,
Neiman-Marcus? They don't take plastic.
Hey, I appreciate the thought.
Now, go home, okay?
I need to talk to you.
Hey, I'm sorry about
your boyfriend. I really am.
But I'm tired and hungry, and I'm not
in the mood for conversation. Okay?
George. Franny. ¿Qué pasa?
Hey, hotshot, we're closed.
Aw, come on, Fran. I've been
dumped on all day. Give me a break.
Oh, what's the matter, dear?
Tough day at the office?
Well, grill's shut down.
- How 'bout a sandwich?
- Beautiful.
Geez, you don't give up, do you?
I need your help.
For three years in school
you haven't said shit to me.
Now all of a sudden, what... you need
my help, and we're best friends, right?
Nobody believes me about
what happened tonight.
- What did happen?
- You were there. You saw.
All I saw was an old man with
a funky hand. That's all I saw.
- Thanks.
- Can I get you somethin', hon?
No, thank you.
The thing on that man's hand
killed him, and then it killed Paul.
And whatever it is,
it's getting bigger.
Is that what you told the cops?
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?
I know you're the homecoming
queen type and all, but, uh,
are you strung out on
somethin', or what?
You're just the same.
What are you talkin' about?
You act like you're different.
You put on this big show.
But you're just like everybody else in
this town. You're full of shit, Flagg!
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, calm down, all right?
I'm sorry, okay?
Come on, sit down.
You okay, huh?
You want somethin' to eat?
Here. Go ahead.
It'll make you feel better.
Unbelievable.
No, it's just I've never heard
you say the word "shit" before.
What was that like for you?
We're comin' up empty here. Do you
want us to head into the foothills?
Negative. No, I'd rather have
you patrolling the streets.
We'll start all that at first light
when the state police come in.
- Ten-four.
- You look exhausted.
It's been a long night. Thank you.
It's gonna be even longer.
That's the truth.
One deputy and six volunteers.
I feel like the one-legged man
in an ass-kicking contest.
Well, you're doing all you can, Herb.
This isn't your normal
Friday night trouble.
- Something wrong?
- I'm, uh...
I'm just worried about
a friend of mine.
I guess I'm worried about
everybody tonight.
- Dessert?
- Oh, Fran.
- That sandwich busted me.
- On the house. Last two pieces.
Eat up, or I chuck it in the garbage.
Thanks.
Shit.
Here, here. I'll get that.
- I'll get it!
- Here.
- Knock yourself out.
- Well, thanks.
Geez.
What is this?
George? George! George!
Fran?
- George!
- Don't touch him! Don't touch him!
Fran, come on!
In the freezer!
Oh! Oh!
Hear anything?
I'm okay.
Hey.
I'm gonna get us outta here.
I promise.
Come on. Come on, answer!
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.
Please check the
number and dial again.
- Sheriff's station.
- Help me. Get me Herb.
- Get Herb Geller.
- He went down to the diner.
Herb!
You ready?
Okay.
Franny?
Franny!
Great. I killed the strawberry jam.
- Let's get outta here.
- The front door's locked.
That's okay. I got a key.
Merciful God.
Hello?
Is anybody... hurt?
We need to see the sheriff.
I don't know where he is.
- Sheriff's Department. Please hold.
- What about Briggs? Where's Briggs.
I can't raise anybody.
All I'm getting is static.
Sheriff's Department. Please hold.
The last I heard from the deputy,
he was on his way up to Elkin's Grove.
- Elkin's Grove.
- That's where I found the old man.
Come on, let's go.
Looks like he left in a hurry.
Yo, Briggs!
He's gotta be around here somewhere.
In the woods.
In the dark woods.
Right. We could wait here.
Never thought I'd go out
of my way to find a cop.
Hello?
I feel like fuckin'
Hansel and Gretel here.
Should have brought
some bread crumbs.
Wait. I think I hear something.
What the hell is that?
Put those weapons down.
We're here to help you.
- Name?
- Meg Penny.
- Are you a resident of Arborville, Meg?
- Yes, I am.
Have you experienced any
vomiting, nausea or diarrhea?
Hey, back off, huh?
Hey, pal, you wanna fill us in?
- Who the hell are you people?
- I'm Dr. Meddows.
We're a government-sanctioned
biological containment team.
"Biological containment"?
- We're microbe hunters, young lady.
- Flagg?
What are you doing here, boy?
The men from Glad here are showing
us how to keep our leftovers fresh.
These people are here
on serious business.
They don't have time for
your bullshit, understand?
Colonel, has the deputy
been briefed in detail?
Yes, sir.
I'm just heading back to town
now to get things started.
Splendid. Colonel Hargis
will arrange an escort.
What is going on over there?
That's the source of our worries...
a troublesome souvenir from space.
- What?
- A meteorite. Don't get too close.
There's danger of contamination.
- I don't understand.
- Let me tell you a story.
The dinosaurs ruled our
planet for millions of years,
and yet they died
out almost overnight.
Why?
The evidence suggests that a meteor
fell to Earth bearing an alien bacteria.
Plague? Is that what this
whole thing is about?
Prevention.
And you think this meteor brought
some kind of a killer germ?
It's something I've expected
and prepared for all my life.
Well, your meteor
brought somethin', all right.
But if it's a germ, it's the biggest
son of a bitch you've ever seen.
What's the matter?
Isn't it awfully late to
be trimming the hedges?
Maybe this guy's a Peeping
Tom or something.
So let's give him
something to peep at.
Wait a minute.
Hockey season ended months ago.
Watch this. He's gonna get the camp
counselor with the hedge trimmer.
I'll bet the girl gets away.
Ooh, watch. She's gonna run in the lodge
and hide, but he's gonna get her anyway.
Please be quiet.
- You shut up.
- Hey!
You guys gotta shut up. If you get
caught in here, Mom's gonna kill me.
- Get your feet off the seat.
- Anthony, come on.
What a jerk. What a wimp.
Check out the body on the blonde.
Wonderful.
Yeah?
It's Hobbs. Listen,
it's boiling up here.
- The air conditioning on?
- It's on full blast.
Yeah, well, it must be
blocked up or somethin'.
There's nothing wrong
with the air conditioning.
Well, come up and see for yourself.
Hobbs?
Hobbs, are you in here?
I can't begin to thank you both.
This information is
incredibly valuable.
Please, get in.
- Where are we going?
- Back to town.
Arborville is under quarantine until
we've isolated that organism...
and checked every living
soul for signs of infection.
- In the meantime, we're your prisoners.
- Not at all. You're my patients.
Sounds like the same thing to me.
- Brian...
- Young man, please, step into the van.
Look, thanks for the offer, Doc,
but my bike's right back there and
we can make it back on our own.
Hey, by the way, I love your tailor.
I gotta get me one of those.
Get in the van.
Van ride sounds nice.
Clear.
- It's locked.
- So what?
Brian, what is with you?
You're acting like a complete jerk.
I have a problem with
authority figures.
- What are you doing?
- I think we ought to get out of here.
We oughta take my bike
and blow this town.
It's gettin' a little thick
around here, don't you think?
That's crazy. These people
are here to help us.
Come on, Meg. We don't
even know who they are.
NASA? C.I.A.?
The Royal Canadian Mounties?
All I know is I saw a
bunch of unmarked trucks.
- I think this whole thing stinks.
- Well, we can't just run out.
Let's just think of it as looking
out for our best interests, huh?
You coming?
Brian, I have to go back. My family's
there... people that I care about.
I'm goin'. If you're smart,
you'll come with me.
Then go. Take care of yourself.
It's the only thing you're
really good at, isn't it?
No one else ever
volunteered for the job.
Christ, Flagg. A cheerleader.
Clear out. Come on through here.
All right, back it up.
Come on, ma'am.
There is no cause for alarm.
I repeat: There is no cause for alarm.
This is a precautionary quarantine...
due to a potential biological hazard.
This is a precautionary measure.
They're gonna ask a few questions,
and maybe give you a shot.
- Mom! Dad!
- Meg!
Oh, Meg! Oh, thank God
you're all right.
Honey, is Kevin with you?
No. Isn't he staying
over at Eddie's house?
Eddie said they were
staying at your house.
Oh, God! He must've snuck
off to that damn movie.
What movie? You didn't
tell me about any movie.
Sir? Excuse me, but I think
that my little brother is over
- at the movie theater on Main Street.
- Miss, we're going by sectors.
- We'll get there shortly.
- But you don't understand...
We'll handle it, okay?
Now get back in line.
I don't see you handling much
of anything. You on a coffee break?
- Look, mister...
- Don't "Look, mister" me. I'm a taxpayer.
I pay your salary. What are you
gonna do about finding my son?
I understand you're upset.
But if you just get back in line,
we have the situation under control.
Did you know that ten
years ago tonight,
there was a horrible
murder in this house?
- No. No way.
- You'll love this.
He hot-curls her to death.
Mister, we're trying to watch a...
Kevin!
- Kevin!
- Meg!
Meg! Meg!
My zipper!
Come on! Hurry!
Your feet!
No! Aah!
Hurry!
Here! Get it up!
Eddie!
Hurry! Go!
Come on, Meg!
Meg, come on!
- Alpha Team, do you copy?
- Affirmative.
- Status report.
- Highway 31 closed.
Phone lines down. We've got
this town locked up tight.
On up.
We suspected that
conditions in space...
would have a mutating effect
on bacteria, but this...
This activity must be what threw
the satellite out of orbit.
Correct. Our little experimental
virus seems to have grown up...
into a plasmic life-form
that hunts its prey.
A predator. It's fantastic.
Sir, the organism is growing
at a geometric rate.
By all accounts, it's at least a
thousand times its original mass.
This'll put U.S. Defense
years ahead of the Russians.
You don't understand. At this rate,
by next week there may be no U.S.
Nonsense.
All we have to do is
contain it properly.
As far as the locals are concerned,
this is simply a medical quarantine.
Nobody gets in or out.
Dr. Meddows.
Just for the record, I don't
agree with any of this.
Those people's lives are at stake.
Don't you think I know that?
This isn't one of your textbook
exercises, Mr. Jennings.
This is an experiment in biological
warfare. Or hadn't you noticed?
That organism is potentially the greatest
breakthrough in weapons research...
since man split the atom.
What we do here will affect
the balance of world power.
Of course there are lives at stake...
whole nations, in fact.
And that's far more important than a
handful of people in this small town.
And that is my cross to bear,
Mr. Jennings.
Now, carry out your orders.
Yes, sir.
Colonel! Colonel,
we've got a sighting.
- Hargis here.
- Colonel, we've got an eyewitness
who says the organism pursued
some civilians into the sewers.
It's got Kevin and Eddie and Meg
down there! You gotta do something!
Excellent! We need a schematic
of the sewer system.
We'll contain it down there.
I want that organism alive.
What about the civilians?
They're expendable.
Get up.
Stop him!
Attention! We have an infected
civilian trying to escape!
Stop him before he reaches

Dr. Sims and Dr. Divatni,
please report to Med Unit One.
- Are these the schematics?
- Yes, sir.
The whole town's sitting on a system of
aqueducts... runoff from the mountains.
Can the organism be contained?
There seem to be three main junctions...
here, here and here.
If we close off those valves,
I think we got it.
- Is it still after us?
- I don't think so.
I'll... I'll be good, I swear. I'll...
I'll never see a movie ever again.
It's gonna be okay.
Let's just find a way out of here.
This way.
Baker Team, we place you 80
meters south of valve two.
Come on. That's our way out of here.
- Watch out for the rat.
- What rat?
Run!
Run!
Get up the pole! Go!
Come on! Climb! Go!
- Eddie!
- Meg, no!
Get out of there!
No! Meg!
Meg!
- I can't get through!
- You can make it, Meg!
- Come on!
- Run, Kevin! Run!
We have orders not to shoot.
Run, Kevin! Go to town hall!
- No! But Meg...
- Do it, now!
Meg!
Brian!
What are you doing?
Hang on!
Brian!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Forget about it, Brian.
Let's go! Forget about it!
It got 'em... Bigelow and Wilson.
- How do we get out of here?
- They were trying to scream.
Inside it, trying to scream.
Listen to me! How do we get
out of here? Listen to me!
Brian, he's hurt!
I think... we'd better... go now.
Baker Team, what the hell's
going on down there?
We're coming up!
Close the manhole.
That's my man down there!
We've got to contain that thing.
Now, close it off! That's an order!
Do it.
Hey!
No! Hey!
You son of a bitch!
Colonel, you can't! Colonel,
that thing's down here with us!
Meddows! You hear me, Meddows?
Talk to me, man!
Meddows!
The water's rising.
It's comin' for us.
I thought you were gonna
take care of yourself.
I guess I blew it, huh?
I'm sorry, Meg.
I really am.
Brian.
- This thing work? This thing work?
- It won't do any good.
Not against that thing.
All right, Meddows. If you won't
listen to me, listen to this.
Shit!
Fire in sector two!
Charlie Squad to sector two!
All right, people,
please stay where you are!
Stay out of the street!
Mobile weapons unit to sector two!
Mobile weapons unit to sector two!
We got a man down in
sector two! On the double!
Mobile units to sector two!
Flagg! Drop it!
Stay back! Stay back!
It's a lie! All of it!
I said, put it down. I'll blow
you out of your shoes, boy.
- Shoot him.
- Freeze, mister!
All right, hold on.
Everybody... just lower your weapons.
Hold your positions.
Don't come any closer.
He's infected! Contagious!
He'll spread a plague through
this place and kill all of you!
Listen to me, Briggs.
Think for a minute.
Do you suppose an army of guys in plastic
suits show up every time a meteor falls?
Shoot him. That's a direct order!
How do you think they got here so quick?
How did they even know when to come?
- Shoot, damn it! Shoot!
- I'll tell you how!
That meteor is man-made!
It's some kind of a germ
warfare test they fucked up!
Don't try it!
Let's scrag that son of a bitch.
Sensor charge! Short fuse!
Chew on that, slimeball.
- What's happening?
- I think you pissed it off.
Go!
My God.
- The day has come. You don't understand!
- Reverend, come on!
This has all been prophesied.
Come on, move! Get out! Everybody, back!
Back! Everybody, back!
- Brian!
- He ran for it, Meg. Let's go! Go! Move!
You're hot.
Reverend!
Meg, look out!
It's the cold!
It can't stand the cold!
Barricade all the entrances!
Get some more CO2 over here!
Look out! I'm comin' through!
Comin' through!
It's empty, Meg! Get back!
Stay here.
And the great voice spoke to
the seven angels, saying...
There! There! Right there!
- It's out!
- Find some more!
Brian!
Help me.
Come on! You can do better than that!
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Meg!
Brian?
What a rush.
Whoa!
Hey, man. I told you we'd get snow.
You gotta have faith.
I wonder if I'm covered
for this sort of thing.
Dave, bring in the dump truck.
We better get this thing to
the icehouse before dawn.
The will of God is
written in the sky...
in fingers of flame!
Wormwood falls from heaven,
consuming sinner and saint alike.
Who shall be lifted up to rapture...
when the judgment trumpet blows?
None but the faithful,
brothers and sisters.
None but the faithful.

When, Reverend?
