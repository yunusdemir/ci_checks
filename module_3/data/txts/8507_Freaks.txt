We didn't lie to you, folks.
We told you we had living,
breathing, monstrosities.
You'll laugh at them,
shudder at them, and yet,
...but for the accident of birth,
...you might be even as they are.
They did not ask to
be brought into the world...
...but into the world they came.
Their code is a law unto themselves
Offend one,
and you offend them all.
And now, folks,
if you'll just step this way,
you are about to witness the most amazing,
...the most astounding,
living monstrosity of all time.
Friends,
...she was once a beautiful woman.
A royal prince shot himself
for love of her.
She was known as the peacock of the air...
She's the most beautiful
big woman I have ever seen.
Why, Hans, how you talk!
I should be jealous pretty soon.
Ah, don't be silly.
Don't be silly?
I think this woman's
making eyes at my Hans.
Of course, I ain't jealous.
Oh, Frieda, my dear,
I have eyes for only one woman...
...the woman I ask to be my wife.
Are you laughing at me?
Why no, monsieur.
Then I'm glad.
Why should I laugh at you?
Most big people do.
They don't realize I'm a man,
...with the same feelings they have.
Thank you.
You are so kind, monsieur.
Nice, nice.
Don't, don't.
You must come to see me sometime,
...and we'll have a little wine together.
Thank you
...only your imagination.
But Monsieur Dubois, at first,
I could not believe my own eyes.
A lot of horrible, twisted things
crawling, whining, globbering.
Really, Jon, what were you
drinking last night?
Nothing, monsieur, I assure you.
Oh, monsieur, there must be
a law in France...
...to smother such things at birth,
...or lock them up
All right, Jon,
...if there's anything like you say
on my grounds we'll have it removed.
Go away!
Go away all of you!
Don't you know tresspassing's
the same as stealing.
Oh, I'm sorry, monsieur.
I am Madame Tetrallini.
These are children of my circus.
Children! Monsters!
Oh, you're a circus. I understand.
So you see, monsieur,
...when I have a chance I like to
take them into the sunshine
...and let them play like children.
That is what most of them are...
...children.
Children...children.
Please forget the mistake, madame.
You  are welcome to remain.
Au revoir. Come, Jon.
Thanks a thousand, monsieur.
Oh, shame, shame, shame.
How many times have I told you
not to be frightened.
Have I not told you
God looks after all his children?
Good evening Madam Tetralini
How are you Madam Tetralini?
Big crowd tonight...
There she goes taking them off to exercise.
Nurse to a lot of mangy freaks.
Ah ha! Just as they are
represented on the banners,
you will meet them on the
inside...living, breathing monstrosities:
Josephine-Joseph,
half woman, half man.
Have a cigar, Joseph?
You dropped your lipstick, Josephine.
Don't get her sore or
he'll punch you in the nose.
Come on! Hurry up!
You're all wrong.
I didn't d-d-do it.
What are you trying to do, be funny?
Ah, you just d-don't understand.
A Roman lady getting off the bull
and scratching yourself!
Well, c-can't a Roman lady itch?
Why don't you take a bath.
I did, but it's the bull
that needs the b-b-bath.
I think she likes you...
...but he d-don't.
Oh Hans, those flowers you sent
to me...they were beautiful!
But none as beautiful as you.
Oh, thank you.
And Hans, I don't like to ask,
...but may I have the loan of another
thousand franks until
my money from Paris arrives?
With pleasure, fraeulein.
Thank you.
I'll bring it to your wagon tonight.
Oh forget it, forget it.
Maybe I was just fooling.
Fooling? Fooling, huh?
"Come little girl, I want to take
care of you." Oh, and I fell for that!
Ah forget it, forget it.
So you're quitting? Is that it?
Maybe I'm only fooling.
Well you're not quitting me,
'cause I'm kicking you out!
Oh?
Oh no you don't.
I gave you this.
Why you cheap...! Oh!
And don't you come around crying tonight,
trying to get back in.
I'm through wasting my time and
money on dames like you.
Yeah, you're time, but my money!
Ungrateful little tramp.
Well, what are you staring at?
Didn't you ever see a lady move before?
I guess you been listening to every word he said.
That's it. That's it, go ahead and laugh.
It's funny ain't it.
Women are funny, ain't they.
They're all tramps, ain't they. Yeah.
Except when you can get money from them.
Well, I'll be...
Say, who do you think
you are, shooting off your hat.
Hey, this is Phroso...
Phroso you're talking to!
Not any of those lugs you been
chasing around with.
Now you listen to me..
Oh, I didn't mean you.
I had to take it out on somebody.
Yeah, you dames is all alike.
You sharp shoot your cheeks,
and how you squeal when
you get what's coming to you.
Aw, easy. Take it easy. Cut it!
It's my own fault.
What gets me so cockeyed sore at myself
is that I fell for that big bunch of beef.
So you finally got wise to yourself, did you?
Funny thing about you women...
...most of you don't get wise soon enough.
You wait until you're so old nobody wants you.
Nobody does most of the time.
Yeah, you ought to be tickled to
death you're washed up with him.
You're not so hard to look at.
Give yourself a couple.
You'll make the grade.
Your break is coming.
Coming! Gone, you mean.
Oh, now your gonna sit there
feeling sorry for yourself.
Oh, no I ain't.
Don't you ever accuse me of that!
All right! All right!..
But one thing.
Don't go around filling your hide with
a lot of booze, celebrating, 'cause fun what's
got that way never done no one no good.
Get me?
I got you...
Say you're a pretty good kid.
You're darn right I am.
You should've caught me before my operation.
- Hello Phroso!
- Hello Phroso!
Well, well, well!
Tomorrow night's the big night, hey ladies?
Yes, my sister's getting married.
And I'm thrilled to death.
She thrills at anything.
Oh, Roscoe's a good kid.
She's only joking. She'll like him
lots after she knows him better.
Oh, that reminds me.
Close your eyes, Violet.
Go ahead, close them.
What did I do?
You pinched Daisy's arm.
Well, what do you know about that!
Oh, D-Daisy.
Her master's voice is calling.
Getting fresh, ay?
Well, I don't like it one b-b-b-
Well, come on. Come on.
You'll have to hurry.
We haven't much time.
So you were flirting with that
cheap clown, were you?
No, I wasn't.
All he was doing was a trick with me.
You shut up. I'm m-marrying
your sister, n-not you
I saw him getting familiar with you.
Oh come on, Daisy.
Oh no you d-don't.
She's gonna stay right here!
No she isn't! I gotta go.
Oh, phooey! You're always using that for
an excu- for an excu- for an ali-b-b-bi.
Where are you going?
Well, you don't look
around me so much. Do you?
Oh yes, I have seen you.
So that's how it is.
You got to be coy. Well?
Ah! Come on in.
Help yourself to a drink.
Ah! That is fine.
Do you like eating something?
Always.
How many?
Oh, I'm not very hungry...
about six.
How do you like them?
Not bad.
Oh, but you are strong!
You're squeezing me to death.
And you like it.
Oh! You're taking my breath away!
You!
Now here's something for your eye!
But Hans, mein liebling...
...you have not been listening
to a word I have been saying.
Hans!
Yes, Frieda.
You have not been listening to me.
Yes I have, Frieda, I have.
Then what was I saying?
You were saying... You were saying...
What were you saying?
I was saying tonight you must not
smoke such a big cigar.
Your voice was very bad
in tonight's show.
Please, Frieda!
Don't tell me what to do!
When I want a cigar, I smoke a cigar!
I want no orders from a woman!
Ah, Hans, this is the first time since...
...we have been engaged
you have spoken to me so.
Why is it?
Oh, Frijy, I'm sorry. I...
Ah, here's our coffee.
Five lumps of sugar in each.
Oh, Five?..
Say, the little imp spent
some francs on this.
Yes, he did, very.
We're doing very well.
But I don't like fruit.
You should eat a lot.
It's good for you.
Next time I tell him I like champagne.
Who is it?
Hans.
Who?
Hans.
Oh, my darling, your basket of fruit was lovely.
But I... am... uh...
I'm taking a nap.
Can't you come back later?
Yes, fraeulein.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Shhh, you'll spoil everything if he hears you.
What's the matter?
You ain't singing as usual.
Oh, this morning I have
such a big washing to do.
How's Hans?
I said... how's Hans?
Oh, Hans is fine.
Thank you, he's fine.
Frieda, something's wrong. What is it?
Oh, nothing...
...only...well...that Cleopatra woman...
my Hans...oh, I cannot tell you.
She's still after Hans, ain't she.
Yeah. Always she's smiling by him.
Yeah, well if she smiles by somebody I know,
she'll have to buy herself a new set of teeth.
But why is it we women
always have got to worry?
Oh, it's always been that way.
I guess it always will be.
Yeah. And by me she has no shame.
Always when I can hear
it, she says to him,
"Many thanks, my darling, for the flowers."
"Thanks, my darling, for this,"...
...and "Thanks, my darling, for that."
Always something he is give her.
Oh, don't you worry, Frieda,
he doesn't love her... that big horse.
Yes, but she keeps after him.
That's why I worry.
Why not pink tights, you know,
with spangles all around.
It'll show her figure off more.
No. Nein. No tights, without tights.
You know that stuff... they're flimsy...
what you call that stuff?
We'll see her through it.
Why not like Lady Godiva?
Yeah, that's it, we'll have her ride
the feathered white horse.
What have you in your sawdust heads!
What's the matter!
What's the matter!
Oh, I think I sprained my shoulder last night.
Give a rub, will you?
Further, further, down, down,
over, over.
Oh, it's so good to be rubbed.
Our card, lady.
What for?
A fellow rubber from Berlin.
That reminds me, I had a swell
dream about you last night.
Oh, you did?
Yeah. You were standing in a
bathing suit on a rock,
... you know, like a statue,
and the wind was blowing through your hair,
...and the waves were washing around you,
and your  figure ...how it stood out.
It looked great. Say...
You have got a good figure.
Oh, do you think so?
Sure...
Hey Phroso!
Did you try that gag I told you about?
Yeah, I did, and it was a wow.
Get up here, Johnny and I'll show it to you.
I did everything you told me
and it laid 'em right in the sawdust.
Watch this. Venus, watch this.
Hello, Venus.
Hello, Johnny. Say, Phroso, what else did you dream?
Then the dream changed
and we was in Paris.
Paris!
Yeah, at the opera, right in the front box.
We were all dressed up.
Oh gee, what'd I have on?
And did I look swell.
Everybody was pointing at me.
They were saying,
"That's Phroso, the clown."
And was I embarrassed.
Well, did they say anything about me?
Sure, sure.
What'd they say?
Hit me!
Go ahead, hit me!
On the head. Hit me!
Oh, that's how it is.
You don't think it's funny?
It's sad, is it?
Well, it was just panicking 'em...
that's how sad it is.
Phroso!
Phroso!
No! When?
Come on, Venus,
the bearded lady's baby's born!
Oh, ain't it beautiful!
What is it?
A girl.
Oh boy, that's great...
and it's gonna have a beard.
Ah, how's the proud father?
Fine.
What was it?
A girl
Better luck next time.
You might get a couple of Smith Brothers.
I'm trying.
Please, Violet, please don't
quarrel with him any more.
Oh well, if he's going to
say anything, let him say it.
Don't let him "p-p-p" for an hour.
Say, you're going to do as I say.
I'm the b-b-boss of my home.
Half of it, you mean.
Please, please, Violet.
Listen here, I d-don't want those tramps
you g-go with hanging around my wife.
Oh, be quiet! Hook up our dress.
Oh, your d-dress.
I'll hook it up and something else.
And another thing...
...you gotta cut out getting
d-drunk every night, too.
Is that so?
Yeah. I'm not gonna have my wife laying
in b-bed half a day with your hangover.
Come on, Daisy, let's get out of here.
Oh no she d-don't.
She's gonna stay right here.
Come on, I gotta go.
Ah, phooey! You're always using that
for an excu- excu- for an alib-b-bi.
Cleopatra ain't one of us.
Why, we're just filthy things to her.
She'd spit on Hans
if he wasn't giving her presents.
Let her try it.
Let her try doing anything to one of us.
You're right.
She don't know us. But she'll find out.
There you are.
I kinda peeked out the
corner of my eye and caught...
Madame Tetrallini giving us the once over.
I guess she knows she's got
a good act..
...one of the best in the business.
It isn't only our act that gets them.
We've got personality.
We know how to sell the stuff.
Same way in the last town.
Never heard such applause in your life.
Let me tell you something that
everybody around here don't know.
We're only killing time with this circus.
We've got bigger time to follow.
And we can do it too.
Well, catch our act tomorrow night.
We've got something new.
Anything I can do in the act, bro??
Oh, Schlitzey, what a pretty dress.
Oh, how beautiful you look tonight.
You're just a man's woman.
You know what I mean? Huh? You.
If you're a good girl, when I get to
Paris I'm gonna buy you a big hat...
...with a  long beautiful feather on it.
Oh, hello, Elvira. Hello, Jenny-Lee.
Hasn't Schlitzey got a beautiful dress?
Isn't that pretty?
When I get to Paris I'm gonna
buy her a big hat with a long feather on it.
And if you're a good girl, when I get to Paris
I'm gonna buy you a hat...
with a bigger feather on it.
Why, Schlitzey, what's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry, Schlitzey.
Did you see him?
He's out there again tonight.
He followed you from the last town.
I know it, and if Eddie sees us
there'll be a fight.
Why? It's not your fault.
Ah, there you are, Frances.
Thought you'd gone to bed.
Hello, Rollo.
Well, hear that crowd out there again tonight?
I bet you thought the tent was on fire, huh?
Well, it wasn't.
Just the Rollo Brothers panicking 'em again.
But then we do it in every town.
We're so used to it,
it's getting monotonous.
Hey, come on and take a look
at our act tomorrow night.
Careful! Careful!
Don't waste any of it.
Look how it sparkles.
Like your eyes,
dancing, gay, with bubbles.
Oh, it's delicious.
Mmmm. Nice, nice.
It comes by the finest vineyards of France.
Have you sent for it specially for me?
For the most beautiful
woman in all the world.
Darling!
Hello there, baby.
Hey, where you been so long?
You're a funny guy, Phroso.
Sometimes you panic me.
Don't I know it.
I panic the world, because I use my noodle.
I think up funny gags.
I make the world laugh.
With me, clowning is an art.
Hey, why the hat?
The head cold?
Thought you and me
had a date to go out.
Oh! I forgot all about it.
Well, I'm into this now.
I gotta go through with it.
Well, make it snappy, will ya.
I'm all dolled up for the occasion.
Sorry, kid, can't do it now.
We'll make it some other time, huh?
Aw, don't feel that way about it.
I just got this idea all of a sudden
and I gotta finish it.
Funny gag, isn't it?
Yeah. I'm laughing myself sick.
Aw, say, come on.
Honey. Hey.
Come on, come on, come on.
Now, now, now, now.
That's much better.
That's the first time you ever done that!
Ain't the first time I felt like doing it.
Yeah?
Oh, Venus.
I don't mind telling you
I wanted to do this for a long time.
So've I, Phroso.
Well, we're all set now, hey Venus?
Yeah.
We're all set now!
Please. Please do.
Don't you want to make me happy?
Yes...but I don't know what to say.
Just say yes, dear. Will you?
Yes.
Oh, Violet.
What are you kicking about?
You got a good wife. You're happy.
Oh, that sister-in-law of mine...
she wants to sit up half the n-night r-reading.
Gee, that's tough.
Tough! You b-b-
Cleo's gone on a d-d-diet!
It's awfully sweet of you to say that.
And I know Violet will be happy.
Oh, here's Roscoe.
This is Mr. Vadjez.
Glad to meetcha.
Violet and he are engaged to be married.
Oh, yeah?
Yes, and you must come to see us sometime.
Thanks. You must come to v-v-v-
come to see us sometime, too.
I certainly will. Thanks.
Who is it?
It's Frieda, Hans.
May I come in?
Yes, Frieda.
Now that I'm here,
I don't know how to say it...
How to make you understand.
If you knew how I feel, Hans,
to come to you about her.
Oh, Frieda, I'm so sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.
If you could be happy, Hans,
I would not care.
But I am happy, Frieda.
Never in my life was I so happy.
No, Hans. You think it only.
For you she cannot bring happiness.
Ah, Frieda, you don't know!
But I do, Hans.
You think because she's so
beautiful and I'm just a mi...
Don't, Hans! To me you're a man.
But to her you're only something to laugh at.
The whole circus, they make
fun by you and her.
Let them laugh, the swine!
I love her. They can't hurt me.
But they hurt me.
Frieda, I have been a coward.
I should have come to you in the beginning.
Please forgive me?
Yes, Hans, I forgive you.
It is only that you should be happy I want.
Frieda, you won't worry now, will you?
No, I won't worry.
Nice, very nice, hmm?
It's platinum! Hey, where do you think
the little pollywog is getting his money?
Being so particular!
What do you care where the
money comes from. How much is it worth?
We got five hundred for the bracelet...
but this looks like thousands!
I think next time I'll take a fur coat.
Say, that little ape's got ideas about you.
Jealous?
Me? I'll squash him like a bug.
That's his knock.
I'll get rid of him. Go quickly!
Come in.
What do you want?
It's about Hans.
Well? I'm listening.
It's behind his back, everybody's laughing,
because he's in love with you.
Go on.
I know you just make fun.
But Hans, he does not know this.
If he finds out, never again will he be happy.
What makes you think
that I'm just making fun?
Your face... so beautiful...
...and Hans is so little, so cute, eh?
Well, maybe I'm going to marry him!
If you marry, it will be at you
they laugh and stare!
Of course. Nothing like being different.
Cleopatra, queen of the air, married to a dwarf!
A dwarf!
A dwarf.
Then it's not for Hans you care!
It's the money!
Money. You...
little mind reader.
Ah, he has told you of the
fortune he has inherited, eh?..
Always he warned me to tell no one
until after we leave the circus.
A fortune...and fancy you knowing about it too.
Well, I can't be angry at him for that.
No! No! You cannot do this!
No? Hmm, you wait and see.
Please, you can't.
A fortune!
I bet the little lame's worth billions!
A fortune! Can you beat that!
A fortune! And I have him like that.
A fool he ain't.
He knew enough to keep his mouth shut.
I could marry him. Yes!
He would marry me.
Midgets...are not strong...
They could get sick.
How?
It could be done...slowly.
Oh, come on, my little precious, let's drink.
Be happy! Drink!
Hey, K-Koo Koo,
give somebody else a chance!
All right, professor.
A waltz, please.
Show him up, Volcano!
Our wedding night!
What a thrill!
Never before did I think I should be so lucky.
Lucky! I'm the lucky one,
my little Hans.
My Cleo's happy...happy.
Happy?
I'm so happy I even could kiss you,
...you big homely brute!
Ah, my little green-eyed monster.
My husband is jealous!
He loves me!
Come, my little lover.
Drink to the happiness of your loving wife.
Attention! Attention!
We'll make her one of us.
A loving cup! A loving cup!
We accept her...one of us...
gooble, gobble...
They're going to make you
one of them, my peacock!
YOU!...DIRTY!...SLIMY!...FREAKS!
FREAKS!...FREAKS!...GET OUT OF HERE!
Get out! You heard her! Get out!
You filth! Make me one of you, will you!
Well, what are you going to do?
What are you a man or a baby!
Please! Please!
You make me ashamed.
Ashamed! You!
Holy Christmas!
What must I do? Must I play games with you?
Must Mamma take you horsey-back ride?
Ha, ha, that's it! Horsey-back ride!
Come, come, my little fly speck.
Momma is going to take
you horsey-back ride.
Geddy-up! Geddy-up!
Ah forget it, Hans. She is sorry.
I am sorry. Didn't I told you she was drunk?
Didn't I told you we was only having a little fun?
Please. I- I understand...everything.
No, you don't. I tell you, there's nothing
between me and Cleo.
Oh, be quiet!
Haven't you done enough
damage for one  night!
Don't you realize what
I'm being accused of?
I ain't going to be blamed for
something I have not done.
I don't blame you, Cleo.
I don't blame Hercules.
Only me, myself.
Now you're talking like a man. Ha, ha.
You fool!
Always I should have known
you would only laugh at me.
My sweet, I'd rather fall from the trapeze and
break my neck, than hurt your feelings.
Do you understand now?
It was only a joke.
Our wedding...a joke?
Now I know how funny it is.
Hans, the midget!
I'm the fool!
Everywhere they're laughing.
Laughing! Laughing! Laughing! Oh!
You give him too much.
No, I haven't.
I know what I am doing.
Come on.
Pick him up.
Doctor, what is it?
What caused it?
Poison.
A bad case of ptomaine poisoning.
Doctor, did I do wrong then,
giving him mustard water?
No. Probably it saved his life.
Never before did he drink like that.
But she kept making him and making him.
Drink, huh?
Yes?
You better get Cleo to tell the doctor
what she put in that wine last night.
What you talking about, eh?
The stuff she put in the wine!
You're crazy.
Yeah? Well, you can't get away with it.
I'll tell the coppers.
So, hey, tell on your own people?
My people are decent circus folks.
Not dirty rats what would
kill a freak to get his money.
Dirty little...
Ah, your imagination's
getting the best of you.
Yeah? Maybe it is.
But coppers don't have imagination,
so I've been told.
Don't make me have to go to 'em.
Cleo.
Yes?
It has been the fifth night we
have been married...
...a week since I have said
all those things to you.
Don't, don't.
Never can I forgive myself
for what I've said.
I've forgotten. Nothing matters,
except for you to be well.
How good you are by me, Cleo.
I must fix your medicine,
or I'll be late.
I'll be soon back, my little.
Don't be lonely.
I'll never forget what
you are doing for me, Cleo.
But it's what I want to do,
my darling.
Now, now I must hurry.
Cleo.
Will you leave the
door open, please?
Yes, my darling.
Tonight.
They will be ready.
All right.
You come to my wagon.
"I must hurry now and fix your medicine,
my darling, or I will be late..."
"...dirty...slimy...freaks."
He's waiting.
Fine...fine.
Soon we go.
Ah, you're imagining things.
No. Then I hear Hercules tell Cleo,
"Venus knows too much."
Hercules?
Venus?
Yes.
Oh, no!
Thanks, Frieda.
My little, you must go to sleep.
Your friends better go now.
I like them here.
No, no, no, Hans.
They can come back tomorrow.
I will give you your medicine
and get you off to sleep.
Go, go on, all of you,
quick, quick.
What's this?
Give me the little black bottle.
The bottle.
You got this full of poison...to kill.
Phroso!
Get out, Venus!
Get out, Venus!
Get out!
Help, please!
HELP!
How she got that way
will never be known.
Some say a jealous lover.
Others, that it was
the code of the freaks.
Others, the storm.
Believe it or not, there she is.
But, sir, they insist on seeing you.
You know how I feel.
I'm seeing no one.
Have I not told you, Fritz?
Send them away.
Very good, sir.
I can see no one.
- Excuse me, sir, you can't come in.
- Can't I?
- No, sir, I have my orders.
- Well, I'm in ain't I?
Oh, yes you can, Hansy old boy.
There's someone you just gotta see.
Why did you come here?
Please, Hans, don't be angry.
Venus and Phroso
have been so kind by me.
Please, go away...
I can't see no one.
But Hans, you tried to stop them.
It was only the poison you wanted.
It wasn't your fault.
Don't...don't worry, Hans.
Come to me, my lieber.
Don't cry.
Don't, Hans.
Don't cry.
I love you
I love you
