Hey, folks,
I know the Mets are down 3-0
in a best of seven.
l know no World Series team
has ever come back
from 3-0 down to win four straight.
l know they haven't played well.
l know the pitching's been bad.
l know "no clutch hitting,"
l know '86/'69 seem a long, long time ago.
And there's no Ruth, there's no Gehrig.
Goodness gracious,
there's no Donn Clendenon.
But you are not out of it
until you lose four games
in a best of seven.
That is all there is to it.
Back to the phones we go.
Bruce is in Bayside.
-Bruce, how are you?
-How you doing, Chris?
Good to have you aboard, bud. What's up?
Listen, I'm writing off this season.
As far as I'm concerned,
the Mets are out of it.
They're down 3-0.
They might as well pack their bags.
-Write it off?
-Wait a second, my concern is next year.
-What do you mean, write it off?
-You look at great teams of the past,
the A's in '88, the PhiIIies back in the '50s,
the lndians in '54 won
over a hundred games.
The following years, these teams wouldn't
have been anything, they were no good.
-All right.
-The Mets, they'll be out of it this year.
-Question!
-They need to worry about next year.
Did the Indians in '54 say,
after they lost the third game to the Giants,
"You know, let's not show up for Game 4.
We've lost. Let's rebuild for next year"?
They might as well have.
They might as well have.
Hey, the A's won in '89,
and it's not easy to win every single year.
This is a team that has proven
they cannot win in the clutch.
It's so obvious. Every year they...
They won in '86, didn't they?
They won in '86 because a guy couldn't
field a ground ball.
lf l was on first base...
How about the playoffs
and the World Series, Bruce?
The Mets would've lost the World Series
if I was playing first base.
That is incorrect
because the game was tied...
Let's go! Let's go!
How many times you be late for school?
Your sister gets to school on time.
What's the problem with you guys?
You want to be driven around
like you're the President,
like l'm your goddamn chauffeur.
-Dad, it wasn't our fault.
-Dad, it wasn't our fault.
-Oh, yeah? Whose fault was it? Mine?
-No.
Aunt Wendy told us
to take out the garbage,
-and she hogged up the bathroom.
-Hogged up the bathroom.
All morning.
We couldn't get in there
to brush our teeth or do anything.
We had to wait till she got out.
By the time we got out, the bus was gone.
So how are we supposed to be on time?
This is the only way we're gonna get there.
Hey, listen to me.
l'm the boss, not Aunt Wendy.
When it's your turn to use the bathroom,
you tell Aunt Wendy
to get the fuck out of the bathroom.
What are you, men or mice?
"She's hogging the bathroom."
Call me. l'll throw her the fuck out.
...every facet of the game.
They're being outpitched,
they're being outslugged,
and they're being out-fielded.
They're also being out-efforted,
if there's such a word.
They're going to lose 4-0.
No, they're not. They're gonna win.
-Strawberry's fucking killing them.
-They're going to lose!
-Gonna win!
-They're going to lose!
Knock it off.
David Cone will be the starter at Game 4,
and that has a lot of fans, myself...
Strawberry's killing them.
Not only will Cone be setting the pace...
Go Coney! Yeah! All right!
-Knock it off, will you?
-Come on.
Give me a goddamn headache.
l know all five of those runs were unearned.
l still don't think that's...
Bye, Dad.
-Bye, Dad.
-Yeah.
-Bye, Dad.
-See you.
The next two games
in this series are at Shea.
If they can win them
that at least puts a doubt
in the minds of the Dodgers,
and that's what the Mets need.
They need to prove
that the Dodgers are not invincible.
It wouId aIso restore their confidence,
and the Mets are a dangerous team
when they get on a roll
and start believing in themselves.
Jeff Torborg called a closed-door...
Get some shots.
l want some shots over here,
from this window here.
Mikey, come here.
l think we got some prints over here
on the inside of this door.
Right on the inside here. Try and get them.
How you doing?
l got two young girls,
shot in the head twice each.
lt's kind of messy. Over here, Mikey.
Get some pictures
from the other side there, please.
l don't know if they're still wearing
the rounds in their head or what.
Hey, Mikey, get this back door over there.
There's something on the inside.
Around... On that door. Thank you.
-Anybody see anybody?
-Yeah, a dookie.
We got this one Chinese guy over here
who saw a couple guys
running over these park benches
towards Park Avenue.
We got a pretty good description
on the two guys.
The uniformed guy put it on the air.
We'll see what happens.
Michael, on the inside of that door.
And let me have some shots
on the eye-level.
Mets my ass. Dodgers are smoking, huh?
Yeah, they're smoking.
But what about tomorrow?
What are you thinking? You like the Mets?
-What do you think of that shit back there?
-Terrible.
You guys got money coming.
What are you gonna do?
Dodgers all the way.
l'd save your money.
With Cone pitching?
That Conehead motherfucker
got rocked the first game.
l wouldn't bury the Mets.
Even money with Cone pitching?
That's right.
You don't think they're
going to beat him twice, do you?
You're right.
Not only that, they're due, man.
Put my three on the Mets. Even money.
Listen,
take the five. Put it on the Mets.
You say that like it's
a fucking death sentence.
lt's a smart bet.
l think it is a fucking death sentence.
Strawberry burns.
Nah, man. He can't win the four in a row.
-No? All right.
-Three. That's it, max.
-Max.
-What about Strawberry?
Yeah. Give me a cup of coffee.
Don't put on the cover.
-Hello.
-Mike, how are you?
What's up, guy? How are you doing?
Here's what we're going to do.
We took in 1 0,000 in action.
We got six on the Mets,
four on the Dodgers.
Plus, l want another 1 5,000
of my own on LA.
Fifteen? But that's what you're up.
Why don't you just go ahead?
Hey, don't give me that bullshit.
The Dodgers are a lock.
Are you sure?
Just put in the bet.
l'm going to make some money.
You got it, guy.
Give me something to cook.
What's up, man?
Here you go.
Thanks.
lt's good shit.
You can cut it in half.
Shit's going to kill you, man.
What the fuck are you,
a drug counselor or a drug dealer?
Never do your own product.
What kind of fucking businessman are you?
Get back. Police activity.
Give me something back for the road.
l'll see you in a couple of days,
and l'll have the money.
-He's the thief!
-Relax.
-Which one of you guys got the money?
-We ain't got no money.
Empty your pockets out, the two of you.
-What is this, man?
-Empty your pockets. Let me see 'em.
lf we wasn't black,
you wouldn't be doing this shit.
-lt's him. lt's him.
-Shut the hell up, man.
-Cops, arrest him.
-What's going on?
Lieutenant, sir, the owner says
they stole cash from the register.
-The owner's full of shit...
-Shut the fuck up!
He was chasing them down the block
when l caught up with them.
Get me a Bud, a High Boy.
Make sure it's fucking cold.
l'll straighten this out.
-This is bullshit, man.
-That's him.
-lt's him. Arrest him. Arrest him.
-How much did they take?
-How much did they take?
-$500.
-You're out of your mind, man.
-Shut your...
What the fuck?
Take this guy down to the precinct
and make out a report.
-You'll have to come with me, sir.
-No.
-Relax. Just relax.
-No, l don't want to go.
-lt's gonna be okay. Just relax.
-No.
Give me the fucking money now.
Get the fuck out of here.
Your daddy will be right back.
The door sticks. Just a second.
Wow, you're just on time.
Got some very, very fine brown shit for you.
Yeah?
Same you loved last time you were here.
No, nobody there. Nobody there.
Here. Where's your pipe?
You ready?
Here.
This one is yours.
Let's see. Where did l put the lighter?
Here's the lighter.
You got a lighter.
l'll light my cigarette.
lt's lit. Oh, my God.
l'll get you a little bit more here.
Give me a little more.
There you go.
lt's a big pile.
Please leave your message after the beep.
Hi. It's David. Talk to you later.
Hello?
I already received it.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
So with Brett Butler on third
and KaI DanieIs on first,
Strawberry stands in against David Cone.
Cone leaning in for the sign.
He goes to the stretch.
The pitch on the way,
and it's a long high blast
to right center field.
Over the fence and off the scoreboard
at Shea Stadium.
Darryl Strawberry trots it out
around the bases,
and he hits one of those moon shots
that have trademarked his career.
Quite a clout, but maybe too little too late.
A Mets 1 1-0 lead is now 1 1-3.
A three-run homer for Strawberry.
His third home run of the series,
and RBIs 10, 1 1 , and 12.
It's 1 1-3, Mets.
No matter how far Strawberry hits a ball,
he cannot drive in enough runs
to get the Dodgers back in this game.
Strawberry with the moon shot
getting congratulations
in the Dodger dugout.
That brings Eric Davis to the plate,
and right now all the Dodgers
want to try and do
is cIose the Mets out,
gain some momentum back
going into Game 5.
If they can make a little noise here,
get some offense going...
Give her a piece of cake. Mom, you okay?
Have a little bit of cake.
Hey, Strawberry, want a cup of coffee?
Cone into the windup. Here's the first pitch.
Why don't you come here
and have a cup of coffee with us.
Davis again stepping out.
Looks for the sign.
Steps back in.
You know, Iet's face it, foIks,
I know they got a ways to go yet.
I know they have a ways to go.
But the Dodgers blew a match point.
-PossibIe man shot, 1 53...
-I'll tell you something right now.
The first one to get is always the hardest
to get when you're down by a large...
Confirmed, man shot. 1 53 Jane Street.
Hey, Veronica, baby, what's going on?
There's a ki somewhere in the back seat.
Hey. How you doing?
What we got here is
a black male with his throat cut.
-Somebody look at him?
-Yeah, probably.
-Anybody check the car?
-Not yet.
-l'll check the car.
-All right. Good.
Hey, Sarge.
How are you doing, boss? What do we got?
l've got a black male with his throat slit.
-lt looks like he's going to...
-Any weapons?
Lieutenant's checking the seat now.
How about any witnesses?
First three uniform guys on the scene
got two, possible relatives.
Let me see what the Lieutenant
wants us to do here.
-What's that?
-Looks like a ki of coke.
Put it in evidence.
Hey, l want you two guys
to go contact yourjunkie friends
over there on 25th Street till we get up.
You two guys go over
to them two pawnshops,
see what else we can get from that.
What's going on?
They raped a nun up in Spanish Harlem.
lmagine having that happen to you.
l would've killed these motherfuckers.
They took the fucking chalice.
The host was still in there.
What they want with the host?
What the fuck you think?
What, you think they wanna eat the host?
They wanted to pawn
the fucking chalice off.
Put up a $50,000 reward.
Leave it to the Catholic Church.
Girls get raped every day.
Now they're gonna put up 50 Gs
just because these chicks
wear penguin suits.
What is your fucking problem?
The Church is a racket.
So what? Are you a Catholic?
l'm a Catholic.
Why don't you have a little bit
of fucking respect?
Hey, fuck that noise.
How about them Mets?
Bet you won a shitload.
More than you did.
l want to get paid.
What about tomorrow?
What do you guys want to do?
Want to make a bundle?
Leave it all on the Mets.
What, you think they're
going to beat Martinez?
The series has got to last seven games.
You know how much money is riding
on commercial time alone?
A New York/LA team?
When's the last time a series in New York
did not last seven games?
You know the revenue alone
in TV commercials?
Endorsements for the players?
The income it's bringing into the city
for transportation?
There are no fucking jobs
in New York, are there?
There's no way the series
is gonna end tomorrow.
There's too many people want to milk it
for what it's worth.
Did l steer you wrong yesterday?
You want to make a smart move?
Leave it on the Mets.
What do you want to do?
l'm in.
Are you a doubter? l'll tell you what, then.
Don't listen to the way
l steered you yesterday.
All right?
So you owe me money.
What do you want to do?
Dr. Sherman, 247. Dr. Sherman, 247.
Can l help you with something?
l'm in charge of the investigation.
Just checking security.
Security?
Wouldn't want the guys
coming back, would you?
For the nun,
or for you.
Here are the soiled undergarments
and the nun's habit.
They're to be taken by you for evidence.
Now, black pubic hair other than the patient
was found during comb inspection.
Here are the samples of that.
There was trauma to the vaginal mucosa
with multiple lacerations
that appear to be made with a sharp object,
in which the hymen membrane was broken.
lt was stated that this object was a crucifix.
Trauma consistent
with multiple penetration.
Three-centimeter laceration.
Let the Mets be uplifted.
Let the Mets have a nice dinner at home.
Let the Mets look
at the post-game highlights
and see base hits all over the place.
One bullet has been dodged!
Just a couple more to go,
and I'll tell you something right now.
The longer this series goes,
the longer this series goes,
the Dodgers will get awfully tight,
and if it somehow gets to a Game 7...
You girls know you're driving
with a taillight out?
-Really?
-Yeah.
No, we didn't know.
But thank you for telling us.
Let me see your license and registration.
Hey.
-Where's your license?
-Actually, l don't have my license with me.
-You don't?
-No.
-Do you have a driver's license?
-No.
You don't have it with you?
Whose car is this?
Listen, this is our father's car.
We don't have a license.
Yeah?
Does he know you got it?
Yeah.
He does?
Does he know you got the car?
Well, not exactly.
-You being bad girls, huh?
-But it is our dad's...
You being bad girls?
Where are you coming from?
New Jersey.
Yeah?
Got any drugs in the car?
-No.
-No.
-No drugs?
-No.
-Of course not.
-Where were you tonight?
We were at the Kat Club.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Yeah. We were at the Kat Club. Big deal.
l should take you in for driving
without a license and registration.
You know that, don't you?
That's a serious thing.
Have to call your father up.
How do you feel about that?
Don't do that.
Yeah?
What were you girls doing at the,
what was it, the Kit Kat Club?
Get a little stoned there?
Come on. l'm not going to...
l'll do the right thing
if you do the right thing.
l know what it's like
to get stoned a little bit,
to get high a little bit.
You're getting stoned there?
Have any grass there? Coke?
-We smoked a little grass.
-Yeah?
How would your father feel
if he knew you were here now?
You won't tell him.
Well, that depends.
What do you think about that?
A couple of very beautiful girls,
you know that?
Come on. Give us a break.
Couldn't you just give us a warning
for the taillight and let us go home?
Well, you know something?
Two such beautiful girls like you,
l could give you a warning.
You want a warning?
Well, here's the warning.
You do something for me,
and l'll do something for you.
What do you say about that?
You do something for me,
and your father won't find out
you took his car
and you're driving without a license.
You got a boyfriend?
-You got a boyfriend?
-No.
You don't?
l'll tell you something right now.
Now listen up to me, okay?
l'm going to take you down to
the precinct house and call your father.
You hear me?
-You hear me?
-You can't do that.
What will you do for me if l don't do that?
Whatever you say.
-Yeah?
-You can't call our father.
You ever suck a guy's cock?
Did you?
Look at me. You...
You ever suck a guy's cock?
Hey.
l'm talking to you.
You ever suck a guy's cock?
Are you serious?
Did you? Did you?
-Well, yeah. So?
-Yeah?
Don't talk back. Don't talk to me that way.
You hear me?
Don't you talk to me that way.
l'm going to haul your ass right in.
You hear me?
l'm sorry.
Just let us go.
-We'll get it fixed in the morning.
-l'll let you go. l'll let you go.
Turn around. l want to see your ass.
Do you mind that?
Just one look at your ass, okay?
What do you say?
You, come here. Look at me. Look at me.
You ever suck a guy's cock?
You ever suck a guy... Look at me.
You ever suck a guy's cock?
Let me see how you do it.
Show me your mouth
when you suck a guy's cock.
Come on.
Show me your mouth.
Show me your mouth.
What's the big fucking deal?
You've sucked guys' cocks before,
haven't you?
Come on.
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
You hear me?
Show me how you suck a...
Just turn around.
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
l'm fucking serious.
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
lt's the last time l'm going to ask you
or l'm taking you in, you hear me?
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
Show me with your mouth.
Show me with your mouth.
Come on. Spit that gum out.
Give me the gum.
Give me the fucking gum.
Show me how you suck a guy's cock.
Come on. Show me. Show me.
Show me. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth and show me.
Show me. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth. That's it.
Show me, like that. Like that.
Come on, you little fuck.
Come on, you little fuck.
Show me. That's it.
You close your eyes
and take that fucking dick in your mouth.
Come on. That's it. You suck it.
You suck it up. You suck it the fuck up.
You suck it up. You like sucking cock?
Come on, baby, show me your mouth.
Show me that fucking mouth.
Show it to me. Yeah, that's it. That's it.
That's it.
Yeah.
You like sucking dick?
You like sucking dick, you little fuck?
You like sucking a fucking dick?
Come on. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth
and take that fucking dick in your mouth.
ln your mouth,
you little fucking cocksucker.
You little fucking cocksucker,
take it in your fucking mouth.
Come on.
Open up and take that fucking scum.
-Go ahead.
-Okay.
lt's okay. He's gone.
Let's go.
Go gently with her.
Sister, l can't imagine
how you feel right now,
but it's very important that we learn
as much about what happened as possible
so we can get this information out
over the police radio.
What can you tell me
about what happened?
Can you tell me
how many of them there were?
Can you tell me what color they were?
Were they black? Were they white?
Were they Hispanic?
Can you tell me how old they were?
Was one older than the other?
There were two of them.
Two young men.
What can you tell me
about the older of the two?
Were there any distinguishing marks
or tattoos?
An earring?
Did he have a beard or a mustache?
Can you tell me how they were dressed?
Sister, l know this is difficult,
but l can't emphasize how important it is.
The sooner we can get this information
out over the...
Here it is, baII two from Franco,
and John Franco is struggling.
He walked Carlos Hernandez.
He got behind on Scioscia, who singled.
He got behind on Butler, who lined out.
lt's now 2 and 0.
-Daniels in a game situation here.
-Come on, Daniels.
If he can work his way aboard,
then the load falls once again
to Darryl Strawberry,
as he has a chance to play hero
once again for the Dodgers,
but it's up to Daniels at this point.
-From the stretch...
-Come on, Daniels.
Ball three!
Good eyes, good eyes.
Take it. Take your next one.
...a 3-0 count now.
Daniels with Strawberry on deck.
Strawberry already with three hits tonight.
Two to nothing ballgame, ninth inning,
and there's a strike.
Three and one the count, as DanieIs...
All right, all right.
Good move. Take the pitch.
-Eyes, eyes.
-Three and one.
Come on, Daniels. Eyes.
Use your fucking eyes.
Two on, one out.
Here's the 3-1 pitch.
Ground ball to short. Could be two.
Flipped to second for one, relay to first.
-It's a double play!
-You cocksucker!
You fucking miserable fucking cocksucker!
Piece of fucking shit!
You fucking nigger! Fucking cocksucker!
You fucking piece of shit!
-The body of Christ.
-Body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
Congratulations, asshole.
Now you owe him 30,000.
Now what are you going to do?
l'm gonna go double or nothing
on the next game.
Double or nothing?
Come on, what are you,
out of your mind or what?
There's no way l'm gonna let
that bastard take my money.
Take your money? Really?
This guy's going to blow your house up
with you and everybody else in it.
There's no way LA's
going to lose this game.
They're playing at home.
Strawberry's ready to break out.
Fuck Strawberry.
You're gonna wind up
owing this maniac 60,000.
lt's my business. Just place the bet.
-Body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
-Body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
-The body of Christ.
Those boys...
Those sad, raging boys.
They came to me as the needy do,
and like many of the needy, they were rude.
Like all the needy, they took.
And like all the needy, they needed.
Father, l knew them.
They learn in our school,
and they play in our schoolyard,
and they are good boys.
You knew them?
Who are they, Sister?
Who are the boys?
What are their names, the names of these
good boys you knew?
l could tell you their names now,
and l know you are bound by a sacred vow
to keep my secret,
but l cannot tell you their names,
for l, too, am bound.
Jesus turned water to wine.
l ought to have turned bitter semen
into fertile sperm,
hatred to love,
and maybe to have saved their souls.
They did not love me,
but l ought to have loved them.
For Jesus loved those who reviled him,
and never again shall l encounter two boys
whose prayer was more poignant,
more legible, more anguished.
Sid Fernandez and Darryl Strawberry,
a battle of wits and talent here
in the bottom of the ninth in Los Angeles.
Strawberry readies himself.
Fernandez checks for the sign.
The pitch on the way. Swinging. Strike one.
One and one on Strawberry,
as Fernandez came in with that fast baII,
and Darryl could not connect.
One and one the count.
Two outs. Bottom of the ninth.
For Los Angeles, men on second and third.
The Dodgers find themselves down by three
and in need
of one of those Darryl moon shots.
The 1-1 pitch from Fernandez.
Swinging. Foul ball.
Off to the third base side.
One and two the count to Strawberry now
as he once again walks around,
thinks about what he might see
on this next pitch from Sid Fernandez.
One and two to Strawberry.
New York Mets trying to do something
that no other team has ever done,
come back from a three-nothing deficit
in a best of seven series.
Strawberry is ready. So is Fernandez.
Ease to the belt.
The 1-2 pitch to Strawberry.
On the way.
High and outside, it's now 2-2.
So the string runs a little bit longer.
The tension builds here in Los Angeles
as Strawberry and Fernandez battle.
Dodgers trying to eliminate the Mets.
The Mets trying hard to send this series
to a seventh and final game.
Fernandez wants to change baseballs now.
He gets another one back
from the home plate umpire.
It's now a 2-2 count in a game situation.
Once again, no team has ever come back
from a 3-0 deficit
to come back and win a series.
That's what the Mets are trying
to accomplish here.
Strawberry, with that big year this year
for the Dodgers,
trying to continue his hot hitting
in this playoff.
So it's lefty against lefty,
old teammate against old teammate.
Strawberry steps in.
Fernandez to the stretch.
The pitch.
He goes around... Did he go around?
The appeal at third. Yes!
Darryl Strawberry,
on the check-swing, goes too far.
He strikes out.
This game is over,
as Strawberry goes down looking,
and the Dodgers are looking at a Mets team
that has tied the series at three.
Oh, what drama on a 3-2 pitch.
And a third base umpire said,
"Yes, sir, he did go around."
And the expression
on Darryl Strawberry's face says it all.
We're tied at three games apiece,
and the Mets win 8-5.
This sets the scene
for one heck of a seventh game.
Pitching-wise,
it's a match made in a fan's dream.
lmagine, one game, and it's Dwight Gooden
against Orel Hershiser.
Neither pitcher is as powerful
as he once was.
Some of their magic removed
by a surgeon's knife.
But they are still pressure pitchers
who know how to get it done,
possibly two future Hall of Famers.
And Game 7 certainly looks like a game...
l can't help you.
Hey. About time.
He finally shows up. Jesus Christ.
Hey. Yo, Lieu!
Come here.
Hey, how you doing?
l never fucking thought you'd be here.
-How's it going?
-Fucking great.
The world is yours.
Hey, Tommy, can l have some drink tickets?
lt's not like the old days.
Hello, fellas.
Yeah, Papa.
Move it!
Help yourself out, okay?
lf you're doing a hit, do a monster.
-Come on. Here. Do a line.
-Hey.
Come on. Did you have...
How many drinks did you have?
Good.
Hey, you got the money?
What money?
Stop fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?
-Got it with you?
-l don't got it. Not tonight.
You can't get blood from a stone.
Quit fucking around.
Did you bring the money with you?
Come on. This ain't no
fucking joke anymore, seriously.
Just put $1 20,000 on tomorrow's game.
-You're a fucking joke. You know that?
-Sweetheart.
You make me laugh.
-Can l get a vodka on the rocks?
-He's been waiting since the game ended.
You got me waiting here three hours
like a fucking moron.
What is this,
a fucking big game or something with you?
l'm going to win.
You just make sure the fucking bet's in.
You know, l told you once before
that this guy will come by your house
and blow your house up
with your wife and kids and everybody in it.
-You know that, right?
-Good. Good.
l'll give him an extra 1 0 grand
for his trouble.
-l hate that fucking house.
-Yeah?
What do you think, maybe because
you're a cop he won't kill you?
You're this close already to death.
Hey, l've been dodging fucking bullets
since l was 14.
No one can kill me.
l'm blessed.
l'm a fucking Catholic.
How's the case going?
-What case?
-What case?
The case with the $50,000 reward.
Remember?
Yeah. We're on it big time. Lots of leads.
You can use that 50
to get yourself out of this hole.
The Dodgers are going to win the series.
lt's a fucking lock.
Get this, man. l was at the game today,
face-to-fucking-face with Strawberry.
And... And...
And l knew that he struck out on purpose,
and that he's saving it up
for the big one tomorrow.
Today, for the first time, l understood that...
You're sick in the fucking head.
You know that?
That it never could have gone
any other way.
Never could have gone any other way.
So, you just better put in my fucking bet.
$1 20,000 on the last game, the big one.
Come on. You a bookmaker fuck or what?
You know, l'll tell you the truth,
be honest with you.
l'm fed up with this.
Here. l'm going to give you
this guy's number.
You call him yourself.
You tell him what the fuck you want.
Put your own bets in from now on.
Judas.
-You leaving the sinking ship?
-Here. Take that.
Yeah, l'll give you a sinking ship.
lt ain't no joke.
Tell me something. You couldn't pay 60.
You lose, you'll be in for 1 20
to a fucking dago
who'll kill you for nothing.
Yeah. Keep laughing.
You're supposed to cover that,
you didn't even have the 60.
lt's now 1 :00.
Better be careful.
Hey, what's up, man? Come on in.
How you feeling, man?
Come on in. Come on in.
Come on, come on.
Eat something. lt's dinnertime. Come on.
You have to help your sister
with her homework. Come on. Hurry it up.
Excuse me.
Make yourself at home.
Make yourself at home. Sit down.
l know, l know.
Fourteen across is a three-letter word.
$30. Passing fancy.
-Fad.
-Fad?
-Would you please spell it, please?
-F-A-D.
-Are you sure?
-l think so.
All right. Continue.
Number 17 across.
Seventeen across is a four-letter word,
which means $40.
This is a fluffy mass, as in smoke.
A fluffy mass, as smoke.
The clock's running.
Remember, you can use your scratch sheet.
You can confer with one another,
because your opponents can't see
what you're doing.
Because it sometimes helps.
Fluffy mess... I'm sorry. It goes to Team B.
You, too, can use your scratch sheet,
because your opponents can't see
what you're doing.
Dodgers are going to win tomorrow.
Yes, l know.
A five-letter word. $50.
The last movement of a sonata.
-Rondo.
-Would you spell it?
R-O-N-D-O.
All right. That's absolutely right.
Please go ahead.
Seventeen across.
Seventeen across.
A four-letter word. $40. A fluffy mass.
There's 30 G in there, so be careful.
-Flow?
-Can you spell that?
-All right, number seven across.
-Seven across.
Seven across. A three-letter word for $30...
-All right, seven down.
-Seven down.
Give me the definition, in three words,
of a river in central China.
-l know this.
-Central China.
-Fifteen seconds... Ten seconds left.
-Han. H-A-N.
That's absolutely right, Charlie.
Congratulations.
-All right, the next choice, please.
-Seventeen across.
Seventeen across is a four-letter word,
which means $40.
This is a fluffy mass,
as in smoke. A fluffy...
-Are you going to be all right, man? Yo.
-Yeah.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
l got it. l got it. l...
l tell you, man, you better take it easy.
A fluffy mass... I'm sorry.
You take care, man.
Large?
I want my money.
lt's still my money.
lf you want a chance
to have any part of it, shithead,
you will take my bet
for $1 20,000 on tomorrow's game.
What about the money you owe me
from yesterday's game?
Fuck yesterday's game!
The series is seven games, not six!
Put in my bet!
l'll think about it.
There's nothing to think about.
Either you put in my bet,
or you get nothing.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Really, l'm no fucking asshole.
l'm a fucking cop!
All right. You meet me tomorrow
in front of the Garden, 33rd and 8th.
You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
There we go.
lt's a beautiful vein.
All right.
ln it goes.
Vampires are lucky.
They can feed on others.
We got to eat away at ourselves.
We got to eat our legs
so we got the energy to walk.
We got to come so we can go.
We got to suck ourselves off.
We got to eat away at ourselves
till there's nothing left but appetite.
We give and give,
and give crazy.
You have to give to make sense?
Ain't worth it.
Jesus said 70 times 7.
No one will ever understand why...
Why you did it.
They'll just forget about you tomorrow,
but you got to do it.
Hershiser leans in for the sign.
Ease to the belt. His pitch to Bonilla.
BaII, outside.
Orel Hershiser does not
have his good stuff.
He has struggled the entire four innings.
Dwight Gooden leads off third.
Vince Coleman on first,
dancing back and forth,
trying to distract Hershiser,
who's having enough trouble
concentrating on his pitches at this point.
Ease to the stretch.
Here's the 1-0 pitch to Bonilla,
and Bonilla rips it down the third base line.
It's rolling toward the corner.
Gooden scores easily.
Now the ball's bouncing around
in the corner,
and Coleman is tearing around third.
He'll score.
Bonilla around second, holds up,
goes back into second with a double.
The Mets lead 5 to 0.
Five to 0, and you got to wonder
if the Dodgers can ever recover
from this deficit.
That should be it for Hershiser.
In fact, Tommy Lasorda's
coming out of the dugout right now.
Before he even reaches the mound,
he has motioned to the bullpen,
and in, in reIief, comes Ramon Martinez.
Lasorda using every arm he has available
to try and win this series.
Meanwhile, the game competitor...
Listen to me, Sister.
Listen to me good.
The other cops will just put these guys
through the system.
They're juveniles.
They'll walk.
Get it?
But l'll beat the system and do justice.
Real justice.
For you.
l have already forgiven them.
Come on, lady.
These guys put out cigarette butts
on your...
Get with the program.
How could you...
How could you forgive these mother...
These... These guys? Excuse me.
How could you?
Deep down inside, don't you want them
to pay for what they did to you?
Don't you want this crime revenged?
l've forgiven them.
But...
Do you have the right?
You're not the only woman in the world.
You're not even the only nun.
Your forgiveness
will leave blood in its wake.
What if these guys do this to other nuns?
Other virgins?
Old women who'll die from the shock?
Do you have the right
to let these boys go free?
Can you bear the burden, Sister?
Talk to Jesus.
Pray.
You do believe in God, don't you?
That Jesus Christ died for your sins?
What?
You got something
that you want to say to me?
You fuck.
You rat-fucker.
You rat-fuck!
Here's your...
What?
Say something. l know.
You're just standing there.
What am l going to do?
You gotta say something!
Something!
You fuck!
You fucking stand there,
and you want me to do every fucking thing?
Where were you?
Where the fuck were you?
Where were you?
Where the hell were you?
l...
l'm sorry.
l'm so sorry!
l'm sorry!
l did so many bad things!
l'm sorry!
l tried to do...
l tried to do the right thing,
but l'm weak. l'm too fucking weak!
l need you to help me.
Help me!
l need you to help me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, please.
Forgive me, Father.
Quite a match-up here.
Ramon Martinez against Howard Johnson,
the power pitcher and the fastball hitter.
Vince Coleman is leading off third base.
Bobby Bonilla off first.
HoJo has not had much
success against Martinez.
l stole it from my husband's shop
so's l could return it
to where it ought to be.
lt's a holy thing.
A holy thing.
-Which way is it?
-The boys right across the street there.
Julio and Paulo.
lt's a holy thing.
-A holy thing.
-Martinez challenged HoJo
with his best, his fastbaII, and HoJo set...
Me, like everybody else, had high hopes
for the Dodger club.
There's a great deal of talent here,
but theyjust can't seem to keep it together.
Freeze.
Go ahead
and keep your hands in front of you.
Keep your hands out in front of you.
Get out of here.
Way back, it may go. Gone!
A home run for Mike Scioscia.
You, get out.
Well, Scioscia seemed to wait on the pitch,
drove it the other way.
Good piece of hitting
by the Dodger veteran.
And the remaining Dodger fans,
well, they finally have something
to cheer about.
The Dodgers must've been wondering
if they could do anything right today.
Put them on.
Lock it.
-What's your name?
-Julio.
-What's your name?
-Paulo.
David Cone is on, in relief,
for the New York Mets.
Upside and high, ball one.
Sid Fernandez and Pete Schourek
are both getting ready in the bullpen.
Cone knows, with this big lead,
he has to throw strikes.
Here's a pitch on the way,
breaking ball over called strike.
Jose appeared to be taking...
Put your hands up there
where l can see them.
He had a bunt hit in the opening game
of the series.
And the pitch is thrown outside and high.
Ball two.
Jose seemed to be swinging away,
but wisely he laid off.
Now David behind,
and the count two and one.
Up by seven runs,
David just wants to throw strikes.
Nothing's been real easy
for either team in the series.
Cone into the windup. Bunted!
Handled easily, though. Throw to first base.
Give me a light.
And now the Mets need just one more out.
You know, on the replay, you can see
that ball bounce right on the plate,
making for the easy play.
A lot like Coleman's hit in the fourth,
but Coleman's ball must've gone
30 feet in the air.
Now it's going to be Lenny Harris
representing the Dodgers' final hope.
Harris, at .225...
Hold it.
You want some good shit?
-Yeah.
-Pitch thrown to Len Harris.
Swing and a miss. Strike one.
Harris, like many of these Dodgers,
came out on fire when the series opened,
but seems to have just disappeared.
Of course, Met pitching has had a lot to do
with that disappearance.
In the cIutch,
the Mets pitchers just could not be denied.
Mets are now all standing
on the dugout steps in anticipation.
Pitch thrown is ball one.
Lenny Harris thought about it, he laid off.
And the count's even at one and one.
At this point, well,
it looks like the Met fans...
Put your hand up there where l can see it.
...here at Dodger Stadium.
You can see pockets of Met rooters
aII around the stadium,
and they're already celebrating.
Foul ball coming back and out of play.
Now David Cone...
-Give me a light.
-...needs one more strike
to complete the most amazing comeback
in playoff history.
I'll never forget the '86 championship
against the Astros,
but this one has to be the best.
Everyone, but everyone,
had counted the Mets out,
and now they're just one strike away
from winning it all.
You know, this whole thing
is really unbelievable.
Here we go. One and two the count.
Cone has his sign.
The windup and the pitch on the way.
Strike three called! The Mets win it.
Harris doesn't Iike it, but it's aII over.
The Mets have won the championship,
and the Mets are the first team ever
to come back from a 3-0 deficit
to win a playoff or a World Series.
The Mets are on the field.
Jeff Torborg in the middle,
a very happy man.
What a job he's done for the team.
-Out the door.
-Dwight Gooden gets the victory
with an aid and assist from David Cone
in the eighth and ninth innings.
Well, you can't believe it.
The Mets are going on to the World Series.
The Mets make history.
Not only have they won
the National League Championship Series
with this 8-1 victory over Los Angeles,
they've become the first team
to come back from the brink of eIimination,
down three games to none,
and win the series
by taking four straight games.
I'd say that that's highly impossible,
but it's possible. They've done it.
This miracle comeback stands side by side,
in the annaIs of this team,
with all the exploits
of the 1969 Miracle Mets
and their World Series Championship,
and the 1986 World Series win over Boston.
You raped a holy thing.
You destroyed that young girl,
and she forgives you.
You hear that? She forgives you.
You fucking heroes.
You like holding her down
and shoving your dick into her
while she couldn't do nothing about it?
Did you like that?
Watch this, motherfucker.
Here. Watch this, you cocksucker!
Look at that.
You can't do a thing about that, can you?
Can you? Look at me.
Can you? Can you, fuck-face? Can you?
Go ahead. Move.
Move, you cocksucker. Move.
l'd like to blow your fucking face apart.
You fucking scumbags.
And she forgives you.
How could she forgive that?
How could she forgive
you slimy little bastards?
How could she forgive a thing like that?
All passengers westbound,
Los Angeles, San Diego, now boarding.
Attention, passengers.
Last call for southbound

All aboard.
lf you think you're not getting on this bus,
you're dead wrong, man.
There's no fucking way
that you're going to miss this bus.
You get on this fucking bus, man,
'cause your life ain't worth shit in this town.
Hey, cop!
