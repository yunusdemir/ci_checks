# Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
# It's not warm when she's away
# Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
# And she's always gone too long
# Any time she goes away
# Wonder this time where she's gone
Santiago de Chile, 1973.
Political riots have been
destabilizing the entire country.
Chile has become the latest
battleground of the Cold War
with the United States
turning its back on the young democracy.
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union
guarantees its support.
The US government says Salvador Allende
is nothing but a communist
who needs to be kicked out from office.
Hundreds of thousands of people
are taking to the streets
of Santiago de Chile in support
of President Salvador Allende.
Experts see Chile
at the verge of a civil war.
# Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
The world is holding its breath
as we wait for the latest
developments in Chile.
# Any time she goes away
# Any time she goes away
# Any time she goes away
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have begun our initial descent
into Santiago de Chile.
Please fasten your seat belts,
fold away your tray tables
and bring your seats
into an upright position.
We'll be landing shortly. Thank you.
Comrades, why are we here?
Burning under the sun. Ask yourself!
We are here so the working class
can have more power!
I know we are all suffering,
but we must fight
for our President Allende!
Off! Off! Off! Off!
Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!
Easy, ladies!
You all know the magic words.
OK, Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your golden hair!
- Oh, my God!
- What's going on?
Just get out of the way!
Why are they protesting?
Inflation, food shortages.
It is getting very bad now.
Boy, I should have taken the Miami route.
That's him!
Wait. I'm getting off.
We must defend our interest...
- Are you crazy?
- See you in four days.
Make him work for it!
Let us be seen
as one Chilean with dignity.
As a Chilean who stands
side by side with the poorest.
Here I am with the rest of you,
my colleagues,
because I want to defend what is ours.
And I will be here
till the end if necessary.
I am here, my friends.
Because I've got the conscience
of a working-class man.
Hi.
Our right to build a future.
A future for justice and liberty.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You're crazy.
Welcome.
Daniel?
If you want to hide anything
or put anything aside...
Like from another girl or...?
Maybe.
Because if I find a harem of hot Chilean
girls stashed in your apartment,
I'm gonna cut your balls off!
# Try
# Try
# Try
- You've been busy.
- Hm-hm.
I didn't come to Chile for nothing.
# Just a little bit harder
# So I can love, love, love him
# I tell myself
# Well, I'm gonna try, yeah
You've passed the home inspection.
But I still need to search you.
You have a warrant?
Do I need one?
# Well, I don't care how long
it's gonna take you now
# But if it's a dream I don't want it
# No, I don't really want it
# If it's a dream I don't want it
The US wants to see us fail.
They want to topple Allende,
to take control over Chile and our lives!
We will stand our ground and fight back!
- Viva Chile!
- Viva Chile!
Viva Chile!
Chile! Chile! Chile! Chile! Chile! Chile!
He's great. Very good.
Daniel has designed a new poster for us
to spread our message. Daniel, come.
Come!
Come on. Up.
No, no, no. You have to speak.
You have to speak to the people.
- No.
- Yes, come on.
Hey.
Speak!
I came to Chile around four months ago,
and it has become my country.
But what we need
in this country is solidarity.
The suffering of the many must never again
be the foundation
for the wealth of the few.
Chile! Chile! Chile!
Chile! Chile! Chile!
Chile! Chile! Chile! Chile!
Chile! Chile! Chile! Chile! Chile...
Good morning.
President Allende called.
I told him you were sleeping.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Give me the camera.
- The camera's mine now.
Oh! It was all a ruse to get the camera!
You have a great eye.
What?
I think your pictures
have got so much better.
These are my favorites.
Look at this one.
So powerful.
You've got quite an eye yourself.
This is so powerful.
The modern man:
sexy and practical at the same time.
I can't believe it.
You have to go back in two days.
Don't think about that now.
Why can't you just stay here? With me?
Keep the house clean, do the laundry.
Have your slippers waiting for you
by the fire, your dinner ready.
I can't stay here.
But maybe it's time that you came back.
Yeah.
Phone's ringing.
Yeah. Leave it.
- It's my mother.
- How do you know?
The disappointed ring.
Today is my father's birthday.
She wants me to talk to him.
And you won't, I guess?
I'm done with him.
Daniel. Take it.
Hello?
What?
Shit! Yeah.
Thanks, yeah.
We've got to go. Pinochet has taken
over. There's been a military coup.
They're arresting Allende supporters. They
confiscated my posters at the university.
- They'll be here soon. We have to go!
- Where are we gonna go?
I don't know. Just out!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
What are you doing?
- Stop it!
- Hey!
Hey, you! Hey!
Give me the camera.
- What have you got there?
- I can take out the film.
Stop! Stop!
-  We're foreign citizens.
- Hey! Hey!
Get in line, you son of a bitch.
Hands above your head
and shut the fuck up!
Attention!
Law and order
are being re-established in Chile.
Be assured that everybody who is here
by mistake will soon be released.
Soldiers have orders to shoot
anybody who moves or talks.
This is Allende's driver.
He's one of the union leaders.
This is the German guy
who made the posters.
This one, to the bus.
I didn't do anything.
- Who are your accomplices?
- What?
Who are your accomplices?
I don't have accomplices. I'm German.
I'm German. No!
Please.
I'm innocent.
No!
They shoved him in a van
and they drove him away.
A white bus, with a red cross in a circle.
Like an ambulance.
We know that bus.
So you know where he is?
It's a place in the South.
Completely cut off from the outside world.
Pinochet's police take prisoners there.
- What's it called?
- Colonia Dignidad.
The Colony of Dignity.
Well, we need to get him out.
Look, this is not
about Daniel or me or him or her.
It's a bigger cause we are fighting for.
What do you mean?
We can't do anything for Daniel.
But he's one of you!
We are going into hiding.
And Daniel?
I wish him luck.
That's enough. Untie him.
- He's yours.
- Thank you.
You can go.
It's alright. It's alright.
I'm here now.
It's OK.
You're safe.
There's no danger anymore. Just relax.
I'm sure you are mistaken, Miss Kortus.
The Colonia Dignidad is a long-established
and completely respectable enterprise...
...with full government approval.
We here at Amnesty International
have no further information.
If I were you,
I'd stay in touch with your embassy.
But I've...
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Kortus and goodbye.
Goodbye.
I'm being bugged. Now we can talk.
I'm not getting it.
What is this place?
Allegedly, a charitable mission.
But really, it's a kind of cult,
run by a man called Paul Sch√§fer,
or Pius, as they call him.
He was a lay preacher in Germany after
the war. Came here with his disciples
to set up a world according
to his rules, in the middle of nowhere.
- What kind of rules?
- No one really knows.
What if I went there? Joined up.
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?
You may never get back out.
But I could get in?
Probably.
Dear Roman, you must be
standing in the lobby now,
ready to leave for the airport,
but I won't be coming.
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
Crazy things are happening here, and
sometimes you have to break the rules.
Isn't that what you told me?
Can you cover for me, please, Roman?
I'll be on next week's flight.
And wish me luck. Love, Lena.
- Is everything OK?
- Lena's not coming. She's ill.
She'll be on the flight next week.
Let's go.
Cross the field
and walk toward the mountain.
- You can't miss it.
- Thank you.
God bless.
God bless.
Come.
- God bless.
- God bless.
You wish to join us?
Yes, ma'am.
- I want to follow the way of the Lord.
- Don't babble.
The Lord doesn't like idle talk.
A simple "yes" will suffice.
Mealtime. Come.
Um...
You won't need any of this.
Are you alright?
Leave the boy alone.
- But he's crying.
- It's none of your business.
- God bless.
- God bless.
Come, pull yourself together
and stop crying now.
Your turn.
Your turn.
For what?
General confession with Pius.
Come in.
What's your name?
Lena.
So how have you spent
your life so far, Lena?
I've been searching for God,
but I haven't found him yet.
You see, even though he's everywhere,
he's so hard to find.
Do you know who I am? Who am I?
You're Pius,
the good shepherd, who leads his flock
to the Lord's heavenly kingdom.
Yeah.
Ours is a poor and humble life,
full of hard work.
Once you join us, you must remain.
Yes.
You're an attractive woman.
You must have a boyfriend.
Someone who loves you.
No. I want to follow the way of the Lord.
You're not telling the truth.
I can see it in your eyes.
I see it in your soul.
- Is Satan inside you?
- No.
Take off your apron.
Take off your apron.
Open your blouse.
Open your blouse.
Just what I thought.
Gray rags on the outside,
the instruments of the harlot beneath.
I smell the beast of hell.
- Did you touch yourself?
- No.
- Is Satan inside you?
- No.
- Do you renounce Satan, the beast of hell?
- Yes.
- Do you renounce the sins of the flesh?
- Yes.
- Do you renounce all lies and deceit?
- Yes!
Tell me the truth.
Why are you here?
I'm here for you, Pius.
I need you, that's why.
Oh, now you've spoken truly.
Feel the grace of the Lord
coming down on you.
Men, women and children live separately.
It's best for everybody that way.
And separate means separate.
Lena!
Come.
Your bed is back there.
Everything you need is in the basket.
Use the bandage to tie down
your breasts. And take off those shoes.
You look like a slut.
This is Lena. She is one of you now.
Hello.
God bless.
Hello.
Are you from the outside?
Yes, I'm... I'm from the outside.
She's from the outside!
That's funny.
Can I tell you a secret?
I may be getting married soon.
Really? I thought men and women here
were separated.
They are. But sometimes...
Get in line.
- Swallow.
- What for? I...
Swallow!
Open.
Work means serving God.
And if you carry the Lord in your heart,
your hands will do the Lord's work.
My God.
What did you do to him?
We just asked him a couple of questions.
I don't know if he'll ever
become a human being again.
He could still be useful.
But if the electric shocks
damaged the cortex,
nobody knows what he'll be like.
Everything under God's sun
is good for something.
Got it?
You know, if your people treat prisoners
as badly as this one, that's no good.
Worst case, he'll shit all over himself
and die without revealing anything.
I see exactly what you mean.
That's where psychology comes into play.
Anyone can torture.
But to break a person, without
harming physically, that's an art.
Doro, quicker.
And the rest of you.
Is that how you serve the Lord,
you lazy slut?
No, no, please,
I just need to drink something.
Is that so?
OK.
I'll take care of that.
Thank you.
Stop! You think I'm waiting on you?
If even one drop is missing by
this evening, I'll make you regret it.
And keep that bucket
next to you at all times.
What are you cows staring at?
What are you doing here?
N... N... Nothing.
Out. Come on, let's go.
Today's schedule has been changed.
All women are to come
to the women's hall immediately.
You heard. Everyone to
the women's hall now. Move it!
- Doro...
- Shh.
Please, just one thing.
How did you and your fianc√© meet?
- You mean Dieter?
- Yes.
Mixed parade.
- What is that?
- When there's important guests,
we sing and get to wear our Sunday best.
And suddenly, there was Dieter.
When was that?
Two... no, three. Three years ago.
Three years ago? And since then?
We are in love.
Yes, but when do you see each other?
We don't.
You haven't seen him for three years?
Couldn't. No mixed parades.
You can't see, because...
your eyes are blind.
And you can't feel
because your hearts are made of stone.
But I... I... I can see, I can feel.
- Because it's God looking through me.
- Yes.
- It's God talking through me.
- Yes!
I'm calling you, Alfred.
Come out of your coffin.
Get up and live. Come and rise.
Rise from death...
...to celebrate the Lord Almighty.
- Yes!
- Lord Almighty!
Yes!
- Because you shall live.
- Yes, live.
- You shall live.
- Alfred, live!
Yes.
I am the resurrection and the life.
And I'm telling you, Alfred,
who believes shall
see the glory of the Lord.
I'm telling you to overcome death.
And rise! Rise! Rise!
Rise!
Pius. We all saw it.
- And we all heard it.
- Yes.
When you called Alfred, it wasn't
your voice. It was God's voice!
But the miracle couldn't take place,
because there's too much sin
in our community.
Too much sin.
You stay here.
- Who's that?
- That's Hans. He's one of us now.
Hans?
I'm... I'm Hans.
He's as dumb as they come, but Pius
wants you to keep an eye on him.
What am I going to do with him?
Just give him an easy job.
Can you handle that?
Good to meet you.
How's it going, Hans?
Fine.
Lena?
Come here a minute.
I know it's awfully difficult
at the beginning.
Everyone struggles at first,
but it's just a test.
And you're doing very well,
I must say. Honestly.
Thank you, Aunt Gisela.
I like you, Lena,
and the others like you, too.
I don't know.
Yeah, they do. I can tell.
Especially Doro.
She just loves you.
And now she's getting married.
- She said so.
- I'm so happy for her.
She must have told you about her fianc√©?
Not really, just that...
...they're in love and his name's Dieter.
Yeah, Dieter.
Doro and Dieter. What a perfect match.
Get back to work now.
Hans?
Where is that bloody moron?
Hans! What the fuck are you doing?
N... Nothing. I... I need to pee.
Did... Did you pee in here?
No.
Did you piss into any of these containers?
- No.
- Take a piss outside.
Damn it.
Dorothea, come along.
Everyone else, go back to sleep.
No! No, no, no, no.
No, no, no!
I said back to sleep.
Dorothea, don't make it worse.
Don't make it worse!
- Come!
- No! Please, don't! No!
No!
Go.
- It still stinks.
- Yes.
Not even this divine music
can drive the devil out.
No.
I still smell the harlot.
Rotten to the core.
Yes.
But it's not your fault, woman,
that you have Satan inside of you.
So you want to marry, eh?
Who would want to marry you,
you ugly, stinking cunt?
I can't hear you. Speak up, woman!
I know who.
Dieter, right?
Dieter.
Dieter, Dieter, Dieter.
What do you say to the proposal
from this ugly, stinking cow?
Well?
It stinks.
That's right.
That's right, Dieter, it stinks.
Why don't you come up here
and relieve your lover of her stench?
Those are the demons in her
that you smell, that we must drive out.
Yes!
- So we can breathe again!
- Yes!
- We must drive it out!
- Yes!
- So we are gonna breathe again.
- No, please!
Are you just going to stand there
like a fool? That doesn't help her.
Come on.
- What we do we do with love.
- Yes!
- What we do we do with love!
- Yes!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Dieter, Dieter, Dieter.
- The whore has enslaved you.
- Yeah!
- That's the work of the devil!
- Yes!
- That is the work of the devil!
- Yes!
Why don't you come up here
and help him? Come on!
No! No!
There's someone at the window!
Gisela. This place is a mess.
Sorry, Pius.
Take off your glasses.
Pius, please.
Glasses off!
Your sister Dorothea
has suddenly fallen very ill.
She was taken
to the hospital for treatment.
Pray for her to get healthy,
and let her example
be a reminder to us all.
Ursel!
- What are you doing here? Go away!
- Please.
How's Doro?
She'll survive.
I'm sorry. Will you tell her?
What was that last night?
Men's gathering.
What do you have to do to be taken there?
Why do you ask?
Ursel!
One... more?
One... more?
OK. Do one more!
Mealtime.
Hans? Men's gathering.
Where is the bloody moron? Hans!
Fuck it.
So you fooled Gisela. Be my guest.
That's what she deserves,
that fat, ugly, stinking cow.
But that you would go and defile our water
with your stinking, whorish, naked body...
Naked!
...defies belief.
I took you in like a daughter.
I made you one of us.
I gave you everything you need.
Hasn't she lived here
snug as a bug in a rug?
Yeah!
Now you show your true face.
For all women are full of lies,
deceit and whorish demons.
Your tears won't save you.
As any loving father should,
I will now cleanse you
of the demons that are within you.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah.
Come on! Show your brotherly love!
Go! Go! Go!
Fuck!
Escape! Escape!
Go get the cars! Get in the cars!
Go! Go! Go!
Get the weapons!
Attention, attention!
Contact with the electric fence
in sector seven.
All men to be armed.
I repeat, contact with
the electric fence in sector seven.
Get the dogs! Get the dogs!
Look! Over there.
Here.
Damn it, it's Hans.
That idiot must have run into the fence.
Let's pick him up
and bring him to the hospital.
Oh, I can see sadness in your eyes.
There's doubts in your heart.
Turmoil in your soul.
Oh, you think you made a mistake.
That you shouldn't
have come here. You regret.
You regret deeply.
It's OK. It's OK, Lena. We're not perfect.
None, none of us.
We all lose our way sometimes.
The Lord loves us,
imperfect as we are.
Open your heart to the Lord
and he will requite
all your doings with his love.
# What language shall I borrow
# To thank thee, dearest friend
# For this thy dying sorrow
# Thy pity without end?
# O make me thine forever
# And should I fainting be
# Lord, let me never
# Never
# Outlive my love
# To thee
Three first.
# The Lord is my shepherd
# No want shall I know
# I feed in green pastures
# Safe-folded I rest
# He leadeth my soul where
# The still waters flow
# Restores me when wand'ring
# Redeems when oppressed
Attention. This is today's final schedule.
All nurses will wear their nurse's
uniform. All others, Sunday best.
Aprons must be absolutely clean
and tied at the back with a ribbon.
After the presidential limousine
has passed by,
we'll all follow in mixed parade.
After the speech, all women
are to return to the women's quarters.
All men will stand at attention
in front of the Freihaus.
Thank you.
Quiet!
Quiet!
We'll go through it. Now you see the car.
Stop!
Very good.
Viva!
Mixed parade!
Mr President, my dear friend.
I thank God's wisdom that the reins
of this country are in your hands.
Daniel?
And you do us the honor
of visiting Colonia Dignidad.
Meet me at the potato shed tonight.
Chile has become our home,
so it's with pride I say...
- I have night shift.
- ...God bless our president,
General Pinochet!
Knock-offs, but better than the originals.
Can you provide 500
by the end of the year?
If you order now.
- And the poison gas. We want both.
- Of course, the sarin is ready.
How can we be sure it works?
We could demonstrate on a dog.
We are not planning to use it on dogs.
Everything under God's sun
is good for something.
- We desire...
- To be sober and pure.
- We deny...
- All lust of the flesh.
- We submit...
- Ourselves to the Lord.
A volunteer for guard duty?
- Not you, Hans.
- Why not?
Why don't you let him? For once?
I'm so sorry
they brought you here as well.
Nobody brought me here.
I joined up... to find you.
Sch√§fer understands that family
gives you home, a sense of belonging.
So he broke up the families,
separated men from women,
children from their parents.
That's why he became so powerful.
How do they have the children
in the first place?
Once in a while he gives them
permission to meet.
But the children don't know their parents.
They take away the babies
from their mothers at three months.
- How do you know all this?
- They don't hide anything from me.
I'm just a retard.
We have to get out of here.
It's all fenced in, the entire compound.
They even have spring guns. I almost
got killed when I tried to get away.
When was that?
- About three months ago.
- That's why you weren't there.
Where?
Men's gathering. I made them
take me there so that you would see me.
There's something down there.
Wait, I'll go and have a look.
It's a tunnel.
Fuck.
Daniel!
Fuck!
Lena.
- Is it time already?
- What do you think I'm here for?
I'm not finished, yet.
So you'll continue tomorrow.
Come now.
Attention. Lena, come to see Pius.
Lena, come to see Pius, immediately!
How long?
Seven minutes, 23 seconds.
If your conscience was clear, you would
have been here in less than five.
Come.
Look at her. She's the savvy one.
Keeps her eyes open.
She knows what's going on, right?
Do you know Ursel?
She's got brains.
But the brainy ones, you can't trust them.
They lose their way too easily.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
So I want you to keep an eye on Ursel,
tell me what you see and hear.
Because there's something going on
with her and I can smell it.
I hardly ever see Ursel.
Well, I can fix that.
She's over there.
Go.
What are you doing here?
Just helping out.
What's wrong?
I just don't know how you stand it here.
I was nine when we came here.
I don't know anything else.
Your parents are here, too?
Gisela is my mother.
Inhale, exhale.
Physically he's fine.
Fine.
But we should take some blood as well
and analyze it.
Blood test.
Let's wait for the blood count
and test the gas tomorrow.
Thank you, my friend.
It's an entire system of tunnels.
I figured it out last night.
You won't believe
what they built down there.
It's kilometers of shafts with electricity
and air ventilation and everything.
But there's this one tunnel
which is blocked by a metal door.
It's the only tunnel which is blocked.
This shaft heads right for the fence.
I think it leads outside,
out of the colony.
- Are you sure?
- We have to give it a try.
I also found another exit.
It leads out into the workshop.
The tunnels connect the entire Colonia.
It's really crazy.
And I'm sure only Sch√§fer
and a few others know about it.
I mean, there's like a whole
secret world going on underneath,
and most of them, they have no clue.
Lena, I'm sure we can make it.
We can get out through the tunnels.
- But we have to leave tonight.
- Tonight?
- They're preparing a test for tomorrow.
- What test?
Poison gas.
The idea is I... I won't survive.
My God.
Look after these, in case I don't make it.
What is this?
Pictures I took from the tunnels.
The underground rooms.
We have to prove what's going on in here.
I don't want to prove anything,
I just want to get out alive.
But we have to nail these guys.
We have to stop this.
- With a few photographs?
- Yes!
Don't you get it?
If you hadn't taken those photos
in Santiago, we wouldn't be here.
So do me a favor.
Stop playing the revolutionary,
hell-bent on saving the world.
You're gonna get us killed!
And no chattering.
- What shall I peel with?
- Didn't you bring your knife?
How stupid can you be?
- I didn't know...
- Not another word!
I'll get you a knife.
Why are you here?
You tell me.
You think I don't know Sch√§fer
told you to spy on me?
Maybe he told me to spy on you, too.
"You've got brains, Lena.
Just like Ursel."
"But the brainy ones are dangerous."
Why is he doing all this?
The whole place, I don't understand it.
Because there is nothing
to understand. He loves it.
His power, the music, the little boys.
It's his heaven on earth.
Did you really believe
he was a man of God?
Of course.
But not anymore.
So have the two of you met?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
The picture inside your cross.
So foolish of you, Lena.
And when nobody's watching,
he's not so retarded anymore.
You're planning to escape.
No.
I am pregnant, Lena.
And I think they know.
And he won't accept it. They'll kill it.
- And probably me, too.
- But the father?
He's not from here.
He was taken here, just like your Hans.
And I took care of him at the hospital.
Where is he now?
He's nowhere. Didn't make it.
That potato you're holding,
it's the same one you had when I left.
Take your things. Go and sit back there.
You'll only gossip otherwise.
Lena?
It's always the same, always the brainy
ones. Where did you get this from?
- I found it.
- Really, just like that?
I'll find out, even if I have to carve
it out of your flesh with a blunt fork.
- So where did you get it from?
- I found it.
Where did you get it from?
Get out!
Get out!
I... I had it.
You said what?
This picture, Hans, belongs to you?
Where did you get it from?
If I tell you,
Uncle Bernd is gonna hit me.
No, Uncle Bernd won't hit you.
Hans!
I... I... In there.
Open up the darkroom.
The... red book.
Red book.
I didn't take these.
I'm impressed, Bernd.
These are great.
It wasn't me, Pius, please.
I...
Don't worry.
The truth will set you free.
Goldilocks can go now. We're going to
have a chat with our good brother Bernd.
Get out, both of you sluts!
Lena?
Lena!
Go through the workshop. It's quicker!
We're taking Ursel.
She's in the potato shed.
Are you insane? That's too far.
I'm not going without Ursel.
Oh, shit. Let's go!
Go! Go! Go! Come on! Come on!
Urgently searching
for Brother Hans and Sister Lena.
They need to be found immediately.
Close and secure all the gates.
- What's going on?
- We're getting out of here. You too!
...all the gates.
Patrol the fence and search...
Come on!
Move it! Move! Come on!
Get in!
What is this?
- You didn't know?
- No.
Hurry up!
- Take me to Hans's room.
- Come on! Get in!
What do we do?
It's only a few meters.
And there's light on the other side.
- I can't do it.
- You wanna go back?
No.
Is that Hans's bed?
Yes.
You go.
You go first. Go.
That goddamn fucking liar.
Go!
Ursel?
Ursel?
Ursel?
Wait!
We made it.
Come on.
Your brother Hans
and your sisters Ursel and Lena
have lost their way
and have forsaken our good Lord.
Pray for them so they find
their way home, where they belong.
I'm outside.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you!
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.
No! Stay! Stay!
Stay.
Lena, let's go.
They'll be here any second.
Come on. Lena! Come.
No!
- Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
It's OK now. We're safe.
Yeah. We're safe.
You know, she was pregnant.
If I hadn't made her come,
she'd still be alive.
It wasn't your fault.
- No?
- No.
I'm sorry.
The ambassador is ready to see you now.
Would you follow me?
This way, please.
These are the pictures I took.
Good work.
Thank you.
Passports. Hot off the press.
And this should fit, more or less.
But there are no more seats on today's
flight, so I reserved for the next one.
- What?
- In a week's time?
- I'm sorry, yes.
- We can't wait for another week.
What day is it today?
Wednesday.
We have a 50/50 chance.
Hello? Is this the Ritz?
Could you put me through
to one of your guests? Roman Breuer.
B-R... Thank you.
Roman? It's Lena.
It's so good to hear your voice.
Tell me, are you
by any chance flying today?
Oh, my God.
They've got themselves two seats
on today's flight.
Yes, they're leaving
for the airport just now.
The Colonia Dignidad
is very powerful here in Chile.
They're probably at the airport to make
sure you won't leave the country.
I will personally take you there.
With my diplomatic status,
I'll get you through border control,
so you'll be safe.
The photos? You've got them?
Shit.
Just a minute!
What are you doing?
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing, really.
We just forgot the photographs.
And we need them
because we're going to nail these guys.
Why aren't we getting out?
- You're safe here.
- Where are we going?
To an underground entrance
so you won't be seen.
Relax.
It may not be the most comfortable
place, but it's absolutely safe.
I'll pick you up
as soon as boarding begins.
Boarding card, please.
Welcome aboard, sir.
- Lauren?
- Yes, Captain?
Is Lena here?
I haven't seen her.
- Could you check with the gate, please?
- Sure.
- Where is this guy?
- Window heat.
High.
We should be boarding by now.
Lena hasn't checked in.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Daniel.
Oh, fuck.
- Thank you for doing this.
- Sure.
Shit.
They must not reach the plane.
This is the last and final
boarding announcement
for Lufthansa 723 to Frankfurt.
Will missing passengers Daniel List
and Lena Kortus please proceed
to the departure gate immediately?
We are closing the flight now.
That's where we need to go.
- No, no, the other way.
- OK, go, go!
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of Captain Roman Breuer
and the entire crew, I want
to welcome you on board this Boeing 707
on a direct service to Frankfurt.

I owe you.
Oh, yes.
Lufthansa 723, do you copy?
