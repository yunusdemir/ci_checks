<i>I've got your final tests here.</i>
<i>Everybody did pretty well.</i>
<i>Uh, I'm gonna call your</i>—
I'm headed this way.
- Later.
- So, what did we decide?
- About what?
- About tonight.
Oh, uh, look, I'll probably get, you know,
hung up with the guys maybe, you know, later.
- Why don't we just meet at the party?
- All right.
- Wouldn't want you waitin' around for me
all night anyway.
- All right. Whatever.
- Cool. I'll see ya later?
- Bye.
Bye.
- Slater-san.
- Hey, man.
- How's it goin'?
- Fixin' to be a lot better, man.
- What time is your party tonight, man?
- 9:30, man.
9:30. Hmm.
Okay. Um, I'll be there, man.
Slater, alligator.
Wait, wait. I gotta cruise by this afternoon...
on a little business,
if you know what I'm talkin' about, so —
<i>- That's what you're talkin'about.</i>
- That's what I'm talkin' about, man.
Oh, man, I'm fuckin' wasted.
Walkin' down the hall by myself.
Smokin' a "J" with 50 elves.
- Later.
- Woodward. Bernstein.
Guess that makes you Deep Throat.
- So, is this a smoked or a liquid lunch?
- Hey.
Smoked, right?
- So, guys, are we gonna play poker tonight?
- Count me out.
- Sure.
- Uh, I'll probably be going to
Pickford's party later, okay? So —
- No. We should do somethin' like that.
- Yeah.
- Goodwin's on his senior trip.
We can play poker anytime.
- Go to a party?
- "Go to a p —"? Come on.
- Come on.
- Mike. Cynthia.
- It's under control.
- I don't feel comfortable at those kinds of things.
- Pick us up at 8:00.
- Okay. All right.
- It's gonna be all right.
- Guess we're going to the party. Okay.
- All right.
Oh, Mike. I gotta tell you
about this dream I had last night.
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- But, um...
- you gotta promise not to tell anyone.
- Yeah, sure.
- No. Say, "I promise."
- Jesus.
- I promise not to tell anyone.
- Okay, thank you.
Um, well —
Okay, there I am, and I'm gettin' it on —
You know, with what had
this perfect female body.
Uh-huh.
But —
- What? What? What?
- Um, I can't say.
Come on, man. You can't give
a buildup like that and not deliver.
I mean, come on. A perfect female body.
It's not a bad start.
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.
- Ah.
- I mean, the hat and the beard.
Oh, well. Best not think
too deeply on this one, right?
- Best not.
- Um, I gotta get some stuff from Mr. Birchfield.
- Uh, see you in a few minutes.
- I understand. Right. I'm sorry.
<i> Gilligan's transistor radio mouth.</i>
<i>Yeah. That was a good one.</i>
Hey. What about that one where that sexy surfer guy
catches that huge wave and lands on the island?
- Oh, yeah!
- Do you remember that?
<i>- "Sexy surfer guy."</i>
- The Mosquitoes. Do you remember that?
<i>- Pink, let's go.</i>
- Come on.
<i>- They were a rock group.</i>
<i>Ginger and Mary Ann formed their own group</i>—
Look, man. I can't go yet
until Miss Wilk gets here.
- So why don't you go get Benny
and check me out on the way back, okay?
- All right.
- What?
- Coach gave me something to give to you.
<i>- They're really doing this.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>He wants them all back by the end of the day too.</i>
<i>Can you believe that one?</i>
- And everybody's signing it?
- Just to get him off our back.
The coaches are just being fucking assholes.
Know what I'm saying?
I mean, you sign it, you never
think about it again. Just let it go.
- You're gonna make a big deal
out of this, aren't you?
You —You're gettin' air from there, man.
It's no good. You see this?
It's gotta be tight.
- You're gonna have to put some gum
around the base of that to get a good hit.
Slate.
Benny. Psst.
<i>- Man, I ain't believin'that shit</i>—
- Two minutes.
<i>About Bonham's one-hour drum solo.</i>
<i>One hour of drums? You couldn't</i>
<i>handle that shit on strong acid, man.</i>
Okay.
Okay. We're gonna go to the bathroom.
Could you guys let Miss Wilks know?
All right. This is totally amazing.
"I voluntarily agree to not indulge
in any alcohol, drugs...
"or engage in any other illegal activity...
"that may in any way jeopardize
the years of hard work...
we as a team have committed to our goal
of a championship season in '76."
- What bullshit.
- The guys are actually signing this crap?
- Apparently.
- God, what are they gonna do next?
- Like, give you guys urine tests or something?
- I didn't know that drugs and alcohol...
were such a big problem
that they had to resort to neo-McCarthyism.
I think they're just afraid some of us
might be having too good a time.
It's the old age suppressing youth thing,
you know.
- "Neo-McCarthyism." I like that.
- Oh, that's good, Tony.
And there you guys were in class trying to
list all the <i>Gilligan's Island</i> episodes...
without even a hint of irony.
What in the hell are you talking about, girl?
- You weren't thinking about it, were you?
<i>- Gilligan's Island</i>?
It's what's called
a male pornographic fantasy.
- Oh, my—
- Think about it.
You're basically alone on a deserted island
with two readily available women.
<i>One, a seductive sex goddess type.</i>
The other, a healthy
girl-next-door type with a nice butt.
So guys have it all.
The Madonna and the whore.
<i>Women get nothing.</i>
<i>We get a geek,</i>
<i>an overweight middle-age guy...</i>
some nerdy scientific type.
<i>- I mean</i>—
- The professor is sexy.
<i>Pink, come on, man.</i>
We're off to raise some hell.
Look at that. Look at that!
- Guys.
<i>- Look at</i>—
<i>- All right. Let's go kick some ass.</i>
- Hey, you guys.
- You guys, wait up.
- What?
- Benny.
- What?
- I have a favor to ask ya.
- What do you need?
Take it easy on my brother
this summer, okay?
- All of you.
- Mitch Kramer?
- Yeah. Mitch Kramer.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna give him a beating he'll never forget.
- Ow!
Well, just don't get him
more than the other guys. Any of you.
- Kind of little. All right?
- Got our word, sis.
- Little brother'll be okay.
- Thanks. See you guys.
Ow!
Benny!
- These guys. I don't know.
<i>- Oh, you love it.</i>
Oh, there's just a little bit of bullshit
in all that, right?
Major bullshit. He's a dead man.
He's fuckin' dead.
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!
<i> Check it out, boys, huh?</i>
<i>I've been waitin'three long years for this one.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- Thosejunior high kids are dead meat.</i>
<i>I promise you.</i>
- Beat 'em!
- Oh, man. Oh, yeah.
Okay, all you freshman fucks.
Listen up.
<i>It's your lucky day. Usually you'd be spending</i>
<i>your freshman summer getting your asses busted...</i>
<i>and running for</i>
<i>your worthless little lives...</i>
but this year,
because we feel so sorry for you...
<i>we're gonna take it easy on you...</i>
<i>and save us all a lot of time.</i>
So, if you meet here — right here —
after school today...
you only get one lick from each of us.
But you run like cowards —
<i>well, it's open season</i>
<i>all summer long, boys.</i>
Oh, yeah. Mitch Kramer?
<i>Mitchy. Mitchy, Mitchy, Mitchy.</i>
We're looking for you, pal.
Your ass will be purple
before the day is over.
Have a nice afternoon.
You better get out of town.
Go spend the summer
with your grandparents or somethin'.
Hey, man. You are gonna show up
to our game tonight, aren't you?
Yeah. I'm pitching. I kind of have to.
How should we inscribe
your tombstone?
How about "Ben Over"?
<i>Yeah, right, pissant.</i>
<i>Why aren't they after anybody else?</i>
<i>They are, man. Believe me.</i>
<i>I know, man.</i>
- Come on, Mel. Hop on.
- Let's go, boy.
Oh, shit.
Hey, Coach.
So, tell me.
<i>Any of you girls gonna be ready</i>
<i>to play some football this fall?</i>
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know, Coach.
You know, uh, I been doing so good
in English classes, you know...
I figured I'd take next fall off
and become a writer.
What do you think about that, huh?
Boy, you wouldn't know how to write your name
if it wasn't stenciled on your locker.
No, seriously. Everybody.
Now, don't go getting soft on me this summer.
You know, you're sitting around
the pool all day, chasing the muff around.
Break down!
Hell, man. My grandmother's quicker
and tougher than you pansies.
Of course, she's 6'3", 250.
<i>Runs a 4.540.</i>
<i>What's the matter with you, Floyd?</i>
What, quarterbacks don't have to do
what their coaches say? Is that it?
Dawson, did you give him that pledge sheet?
<i>- The pledge sheet. You give it to him?</i>
- Yeah, Coach. It's right here.
Randy, if you could get that back to us by the end
of the day, we'd feel a lot better about it.
- You guys see that he does this, okay?
- All right, Coach.
<i>See ya, Coach.</i>
- Randy Floyd.
- Aw, shit.
Before next fall, you're in need of
a serious attitude adjustment, young man.
You better get your priorities straight.
And watch out with that other crowd you're
runnin' with. Don't think I haven't noticed.
<i>- Hey!</i>
- Uh-oh, Pink.
<i>I want that piece of paper on my desk</i>
<i>before you leave here today. Do you hear me?</i>
<i> Get an attitude adjustment.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
- Priorities straight, buddy.
- Runs with a bad crowd.
- Bad people.
- Watch yourself.
Yeah, well, I've got Coach's and everybody
else's attitude-adjusted priorities...
right here.
- Yeah, that's good, Pink.
- Yeah.
<i>Oh! Did you know O'Bannion flunked?</i>
<i>Yeah. What a dumb-shit.</i>
Whoo! Y'all ready to bust some ass?
- What's up, Don? Benny. Melvin.
- Hey.
- See ya later.
- Good to see ya.
Yeah.
Hey. We gotta take your truck.
I'm low on gas. All right?
- We need to take my truck?
- Yeah. Okay?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- What are you doing? Picking up trash?
- What? What?
Man, I was just waiting for one of them
idiot coaches to piss me off again.
I think you take the whole thing
a little too personal.
I think you just gotta —
You gotta shake it off.
Don, have you ever thought about
why we play football?
I mean, how many times have you gotten laid
strictly because you're a football player, huh?
I don't know. A few probably.
A few?
Don, all I'm saying is that...
I bet we could do just as well
if we were in a band or somethin'.
Well, I gotta put in
a final appearance. So —
Wait a minute.
Who you got goin' in there? Shh.
Vicky. Vicky!
Come on. Let's skip out.
Let's go get naked right now. Let's go.
<i>Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.</i>
<i>- Mr. Dawson.</i>
- Yeah.
Why don't you take it somewhere else?
Oh, Mr. Floyd. Are you gracing us
with your presence today?
Uh, might as well.
You know, Ginny, I was thinking maybe
you and I can get together over the summer.
It'll be legal. We could make things happen.
I'll keep it mum's the word.
I promise. I swear to you.
At the party tonight, I heard
there's gonna be a girl with knockers this big.
- Bullshit.
- Promise. Two handfuls.
- Shut up, Carl.
- No way.
- Yes.
- Uh-uh.
- Hey. Psst. Hey.
<i>Pentico got his brother's car. Let's go.</i>
- Cool, man.
- Cool.
- Go talk to him.
- I'm not going alone.
Come on. Come on. Ask him.
<i>Uh, Mr. Payne, sir...</i>
you know, every second
that you could let us out early...
would really increase
our chances of survival.
It's like our sergeant told us
before one trip into the jungle.
<i>"Men!</i>
Fifty of you are leaving on a mission.
Twenty-five of ya ain't comin' back."
Okay.
<i>You know, the '68 Democratic Convention...</i>
<i>was probably the most bitchin'time</i>
<i>I ever had in my life.</i>
Hey, guys. One more thing. Hey. This summer...
when you're being inundated with all this
American bicentennial Fourth ofJuly brouhaha...
don't forget what you're celebrating,
and that's the fact...
that a bunch of slave-owning
aristocratic white males...
didn't want to pay their taxes.
- Yeah!
- Have a good summer.
<i># We got no choice #</i>

I mean, I wasn't in the truck.

- Yeah.
Well, are you in, or are you out?
- In.
- Let's go.
Come on! Let's go!
Go! Come on! Hurry up!
<i>Oh, man. We're screwed!</i>

Oh, shit!
<i>- Come on! Let's go! Whoo!</i>
Oh, shit! Here they come!
I think we really pissed them off, man.
Just drop me off at my house.
- Are you still with me?
- Yeah. I guess.
- This is my house.
- They're slowing down.
You get out and get 'em. You get out.
- Good luck, man. Be there tonight.
- All right.
All right. I'll catch up
with you guys later. Go, go, go.
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, nice try, freshmen.
Tell you what.
Just for being such brave little kids...
I'm only gonna give each of ya
five licks, okay?
All right. Grab a pole then, kids. Let's get goin'.
I don't think so, creep.
Mom!
Carl, get in the house.
Get in the house!
And you —
Get the hell off my property.
Oh. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. I was just escorting
your fine young son home from school.
<i>There's</i>— <i>There were</i>
<i>some ruffians about, and l</i>—
Oh, and, uh, Mitch, Carl.
We'll be seeing each other again.
<i>Oh, that's it. I fuckin'saw that, you little</i>
<i>sack of shit. You two are fuckin'dead!</i>
You hear me? You're fuckin' dead!
Excuse me. Thank you.
All right, you little freshman bitches.
Air raid!
That was pathetic!
<i>You guys are crumbs!</i>
<i>Let's try it again! That means get up,</i>
<i>you lazy little bitches. Get up!</i>
<i>You heard her!</i>
Air raid!
That was horrible, you little slut girls.
You little freshman sluts. Get up!
<i>Get up! Up! Up! Up!</i>
Air raid!
What's fascinating is the way
not only the school...
but the entire community seems to be
supporting this — or at least turn their heads.
- They apparently have permission to use
the parking lot.
- Right.
No parents seem to mind. You know.
They're selling concessions.
- I mean —
- I know.
The seniors, we tried.
We —We gave you all a chance.
But since you little prick-teases
can't follow instructions...
we're just gonna have to try
something else, won't we?
Seniors —
You love us. Smile.
You love us.
<i>Turn over.</i>
Suffer, sisters!
Suffer!
Whoo!
<i>Eat it! Open wide!</i>
<i>- Open wide! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!</i>
<i>- # Why can't we be friends #</i>
Yes! Whoo!
<i>Love it, girls. Love it!</i>
Gorgeous babies.
Welcome to high school, honey.
<i>- You love it, honey.</i>
<i>- You little bitch!</i>
<i>#I remember you when you drank my wine #</i>
<i>- # Why can't we be friends #</i>
<i>- Go!</i>
Propose to Mr. Dawson.
<i>You idiot.</i>
- Will you marry me?
- Don't know. What's in it for me?
<i>- Suck on it harder.</i>
- Anything you want.
- Anything?
- Anything.
Go like this.
- Do you spit or swallow?
- Oh —
Whatever you l-like.
Whatever I like?
I would definitely marry you.
- That is so degrading.
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- You're an asshole.
<i>- Yes, I am.</i>
That's terrible, man.
It's horrible.
Aha!
I just want you guys to know
I feel for you, man.
I did it when I was a freshman,
and you'll do it when you're a senior.
But you're doing great. Now fry like bacon,
you little freshman piggies!
Fry! Fry!
- Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hello there.</i>
- I would like for you to propose to Tony.
Oh, God.
On your knees.
Will you marry me?
- What am I supposed to say here?
- I — I don't know.
Um, what'll you do for me, huh?
Um, anything you want.
- Imagine the possibilities.
- Oh, Jesus.
No, seriously, you can stand up.
- Um, what's your name?
- Sabrina.
- I'm Tony.
- Hi.
- Anthony actually.
- Sorry.
- This is Mike.
- Hey.
We were just discussing the utter
stupidity of these initiation rituals...
and we were —we're kind of wondering
why someone like you...
would subject yourself
to the losing end of it all.
What are we having?
Social hour over here?
I'm supposed to be being a bitch.
Back to the pit.
<i>All right, kiddo.</i>
- It's almost over. Don't worry about it.
- So, uh, am I mistaken...
or was there a little unspoken thing
going on with that young vixen?
- You stud.
- You know how it is.
- I bet she's pretty cute once you clean
all the shit off her.
- I bet she is.
Okay, girlies! It's hot out here,
and I'm really sick of looking at all of you.
So let's just — Let's get out of here.
What are you looking at?
Wipe that face off your head, bitch.
Let's go! Get in the truck!
Get in the truck! Come on!
You know, maybe if you ever
left the poker table —
Maybe if <i>I</i> ever left the poker table?
What about you?
Whatever. I mean, the point is, that's why
we're going out tonight. You know?
Who knows? You might experience something a little
more tangible than an Abraham Lincoln dream.
- That's, like, a hairline fracture right there.
- Shit.
- What's that about? What'd you do?
- I wouldn't doubt it.
My boy Benny
was wearing their asses out, boy!
- Shit.
- I just gave him a little beating he'll never forget.
Here's to ya, Ma.
That's your fucking mother.
Say, man. Fuck the coaches, man.
Just do it for us, man.
- You picked this thing up?
- Yeah. You know.
Hey. What are you doin'?
- He ain't doin' shit now.
- What?
Got any more details of my life you got
figured out you can let me in on, Ben?
Lots of details.
- Hey, O'Bannion, what are you doing?
- What's happening?
Oh, you didn't hear, did you?
- What?
- Didn't hear I got a shotgun pulled on my ass?
- No way!
- Swear to God.

There's a big party tonight.
It should be really great.

Sample of the goods.
Fifteen bucks.
Can you spot me 10?
I'll pay you, like, Tuesday and shit.
Thank you.
"Shebanga."
Who is it?
<i>- Kevin, I think you need to</i>
<i>come out here a minute.</i>
- Hide the shit.
- Oh, man. It reeks in here.
- Shit.
<i>Slater, get up.</i>
<i> Kevin, there's someone</i>
<i>out here who says he needs to talk to you.</i>
Here. What about?
Go get the door man. Here.
- Slater, lose it.
<i>- Kevin, open the door.</i>
- Quick!
<i>- Lose it, man. Damn.</i>
<i>Hey, Dad, Ma. What's up?</i>
- Did you order some kegs of beer?
- No.
Well, there's a fella in a beer truck
out on the street that says you did.
<i>- Oh, really?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>Just a sec.</i>
<i>Shit.</i>
- That guy said I ordered a keg of beer?
- Yeah.
He said it was to be delivered
to the Pickford residence.
- This address?
- This address.
That's kind of funny.
Why don't I go out there and see what's goin' on?
Yeah. I think you better.
<i>I'll be right back.</i>
You guys know anything
about a party here tonight?
- No, sir.
- No.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, man.
- Aren't you a little bit early?
- Uh —
Yeah. About an hour and a half.
But, see, I wanted to get here early,
see if anyone's here.
- I got this little action happening tonight,
man, if you know what I mean.
- So I guess you got the wrong house.
Oh.
Yeah. Inconvenience for you. I'm sorry.
Uh, wrong Mr. Pickford all together.
Hey. These things happen.
Don't worry about it, Ben.
Yeah.
Were you going to have a party
here tonight, Son?
I don't know what that was all about.
Start unpacking.
We're not goin' anywhere.

Hey, batter, batter, batter, swing!
<i>Strike two!</i>
Time.
<i> Kramer, one more pitch. You better</i>

<i>We're gonna beat you like a running mule.</i>
Hey, man. Forget about those guys.
Let's just get this last guy out, okay?
Easy for your ass to say.
- Hey, man. There's nothing you can do about it.
<i>- I'll beat you too.</i>
- How'd they all know I was gonna be here?
- Hey, Kramer!
Quit stallin'! Let's go, baby!
We're waiting for you!
I hope you got more than a jockstrap
under there, you little rat!
Just because you're not gonna be able
to sit down for the rest of the summer,
don't let it affect your concentration.
- Up yours.
- Hey, Mitch.
Could you do the rest of us a favor
and leave through the gate in right field?
That'll draw them all out of here.
I mean, they're gonna get you anyway.
Yeah. Get out of here.
<i>- Who are you, buddy?</i>
- What are you looking at?
Keep your head in the game. Concentrate!
Strike three! Ball game!
<i> Good game. Good game.</i>

Mitchy.
- Oh, what happened to your buds?
- Aw, you're all alone.
- Hey, Mi — Oh.
- Oh.
- Hey, Mitch. Mitch! Hey!
- Kramer.
- How's your dad doing?
- Uh, he's doing great.
This arm ready to throw
about 2,000 yards next fall?
Oh. I don't know. We'll see.
We're depending on you boys.
And let me tell you what.
You're looking good.
Thirteen starters coming back.
Twenty-two lettermen.
- Lookin' tough.
- Yeah.
- Well, uh, you folks take care.
- Okay. Good to see you, Randy.

You know that hurt him, man.
- What's goin' on here?
- Oh, Pink, man. You missed it. Whoo!
- What's up, buddy?
- Where you guys headed off to now?
- We're going up to the Emporium. Gonna join us?
- Yeah. See you up there.
You should sign my paddle later.
- I gotta get seconds with him.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- This is just too slick.
- You next, Pink?
- Sure.
- All right. Say, you already got the kid.
All right. Fuck it. You know what?
I'm gonna go find your little skinny partner Carl...
and his mom, and let me tell you something,
I took it easy on you.
All right? Yeah. You're not smiling now,
are you? You little sack of shit.
Huh? Huh?
- Benny, Don.
- Say, man.
- Bummer about Pickford's party, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah. His old man found out.
Total rip-off, man.
Hey, man. You know, us —
We got a few sixers. You with us?
Uh, yeah. I gotta go home and change.
I'll catch up with you, okay?
All right. See you later. Hey, kid.
Take care of that butt.
<i>- Say, guys. Hold up.</i>
You need a ride?
Yeah. Uh...
I think they left me.
Here you go, man.
Yeah, there's always one senior
who has to be the badass.
I think O'Bannion's gonna be the first senior
in history to take that honor two years in a row.
Guy's a dick. Right?
Yeah. He's, uh, kind of a joke.
He's not a bad guy to have on your side,
though, blocking for ya.
Yeah.
Did you get it bad
when you were a freshman?
Shit, man. Aw.
They waited for my ass
after baseball practice and got me.
God, it was vicious.
I mean, actually, it is best to get
a lot at once, you know...
'cause after about 10 licks, your ass gets
so numb, you might as well get it over with.
I had some pretty cool
seniors though, you know.
They'd take you out
and bust the hell out of you and then...
go get you drunk.
- You know, stuff like that.
- Cool.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Take care, man.
Uh, hey, man. Uh, look.
Since the party's not goin' on...
<i>me and some of the other guys will</i>
<i>probably end upjust riding around.</i>
<i>You want us to stop by and pick you up?</i>
- Well, do you think that's a good idea?
<i>- Oh, yeah. Sure, man. No problem.</i>
Even after you've gotten it bad, the guys who
haven't got you yet will give you a few days to rest.
It, uh — It'd be a pretty cool move to show up
and let 'em know it doesn't bother you that much.
Yeah, okay. Cool.
<i>- See you later?</i>
- Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the ride, man.
<i>Hey, man.</i>
<i>Uh, put some ice on it for a while.</i>
After that it won't be anything
a few beers can't take care of.
<i>#All my friends know the low rider #</i>

Like, what did she say?
I'm just interested.
I think it's funny.
What did she call me?
You hang out with her. You know it.
We know they talk about us. Just tell us.
- Nothing.
- We don't care.
Oh, come on. Nothing. That's a lie when
you do that. I know you're lying, you bitch.
- I know you're lying.
- You're not gonna get mad?
I'm not gonna get mad. I think it's a riot.
I don't care what she thinks.
All right.
She called you a bitch and you a slut.
A slut? She called me a slut?
That bitch. I can't —
- Everybody calls you a slut.
- Shavonne!
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, that bitch. I'm gonna kick her ass.
I can't believe that. What a bitch.
- I thought you said you weren't gonna get mad.
- I'm not mad.
<i>#Low rider is the one to meet</i>
<i>Yeah #</i>
- Look. I got a confession to make.
- What do you mean a confession?
For the, like, last year or so I've been
talking about going to law school...
so I can be an A.C.L.U. Lawyer and be in a position
to help people who are getting fucked over.
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I was standing in line
at the post office yesterday, you know.
And I'm looking around.
And everybody's looking really pathetic.
You know what I mean? I mean, like, people had —
like, got drool just sort of—
Then this guy's bending over.
You could see the crack of his —
It was, like, wife beaters. It was —Anyway, it was —
And I realized I just don't want to do it.
You know what I mean?
It sounds good, but I have to confront the fact
that I don't like the people
I've been talking about helping out.
You know what I'm — I don't think I like people,
period. You guys are okay.
I'm just trying to be honest
about being a misanthrope.
So you're not gonna go to law school?
What do you want to do then?
I want to dance.
<i>All right. Let's rock and roll.</i>
Hey. Hop in, man.
Hey, man. Whose car?
- You know Wooderson?
- How's it goin', man?
Hey. Pretty good.
How's it goin' with you?
Say, man. You got a joint?
Uh, no. Not on me, man.
It'd be a lot cooler if you did.
All right, all right, all right.
Hey, man. You still driving in to Houston
in the morning to get those Aerosmith tickets?
Ooh, you're damn right.
- Evenin', ladies. Ow!
- Nice.
- Need me to pick you up a couple?
- Yeah. Two.
Cool.
- Hey, man. You sure I'm okay in here?
- Yeah, man. You'll be okay.
Look. If anyone starts messing with you,
just play it cool.

Man, I had my hand up her shirt.
- Oh, yeah.
- You were gettin' there?
You hear that?
He was gettin' there.
Son, you wouldn't know what to do with it even
if you had gotten there. So don't worry about it.
- Just 'cause you guys are striking out.
- Grow up, boy.
- That was our last junior high party.
- That's right.
We're in the big time now. We're freshmen,
where all the girls will be putting out.
Your days of lying around
and pulling tongue all night are over.
Yeah, right.

Here comes another one, freshman.
You ready?
- Ladies.
- You like that?
<i>One more for my mother.</i>
Hey. Who is that kid?
What? That kid there? Just some kid we saw running
around that shouldn't have been, by the rec center.
Hey. Can we have some of those beers?
- One of these?
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Why?
- Just give me a beer.
<i>- Get out ofhere, I said!</i>
- Yeah?
Catch. Huh? Hmm?
<i>Tubbs, catch.</i>
<i>Good. Get out ofhere.</i>
- What are you wasting a beer on him for?
- What?
- It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
- Give 'em a beer.
Man, this fuckin' sucks. All right?
Last fuckin' day of school.
No fuckin' party. No fuckin' —
- You just wasted another fuckin' beer.
- Oh, shut up.
Thanks.
- Hmm.

So, which one of your friends
bought you the beer this time?
- Right.
<i>- Hey! Fuck her! I did!</i>

We got 411 positrack out back,

Ford over-30, 11-to-1 pop-up pistons,
Turbo-jet 390 horsepower.
We're talkin' some fuckin' muscle.
Hey, man, I know you got this thing
out of a comic book.
I saw the ad — 2.95.
It was right next to the sea monkeys.
You see that over there?
That's white lightning.
You see the shoes on that thing?
You gotta get some tires. These are pizza cutters.
Yeah.
- Ow.
- You're such an expert.
This is sad.
Shouldn't we be doing something else?
<i>Yeah. Like what?</i>
<i>- I'm bored.</i>
<i>- You're always bored.</i>

<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- I was just about to ask you the same question.
- I heard you got busted.
- Oh, yeah.
They just got Hirshfelder too.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Like, how bad?
- Bad.
- Was it O'Bannion?
- Yeah.
God, I hate that jerk.
I know.
So, um —
What have you guys been doin'?
Just —
I don't know.
Driving around, mostly.
I didn't know thatJodi
was your big sister.
- Oop.
- Hey, did I hear my name over here?
You guys talkin' about me?
Hey, kiddo.
Heard they got you pretty bad.
And I asked them to take it easy on you.
I can't believe they did that.
Man! God! No wonder!
Pink, what happened?
So, where'd they find Hirsh?
I don't know.
Walking out of the rec center, I think.
<i>- Hey.</i>
- What have you guys been doin'?
- Pink, right?
Hi!
Ohh!
Hi.
Whew.
Face it. You got busted
because you couldn't get away.
You try and outrun
O'Bannion and those guys.
I'm gonna be laughin' my ass off when it's
your turn, when they're busting <i>your</i> ass.
Hey, man, I heard last year...
they caught about
10 freshmen at once.
O'Bannion backed his truck
over some pizzas and made 'em eat it, man.
I mean, that's bullshit. Right?
Idiot flunks his senior year
so he can be a dick two years in a row?
Is that legal?
Damn you, Carl!
Ohh! Okay. Let me out.
Hey, Slater, you fuckin' hippie!
Give me drugs, man!
<i>Get some from your mother, man.</i>
- Yeah, we just banged your mother.

Long time no see.

<i>I mean, that's where</i>
<i>all the girls are, right?</i>
But on the other hand, man,
I'd just as soon keep workin'.
- Keep a little change in my pocket.
- Yeah? Wait.
Rather than spend my time listenin' to some dipshit
who doesn't know what he's talkin' about anyway.
I know what you're talkin' about.
- Say, you're a freshman, right?
- Yeah.
All right, so tell me, man.
How's this year's crop of freshman chicks lookin'?
Wood, you're gonna end up in jail
sometime really soon. I know that for a fact.
No, man.
No, let me tell you.
That's what I love about
these high school girls, man.
I get older, they stay the same age.
Yes, they do.
Yes, they do.

Aw.

You wanna come along?
Yeah. Why not?
- Take care, bro.
- You boys have fun now.
Listen, I'm gonna give you shotgun.
But I want you to know it's because —
only 'cause I'm goin' inside.

No, I'm serious, man!
We should be up for anything!
I know. We are.
But what?
I mean, God, don't you ever feel like everything
we do and everything we've been taught...

- Death.
<i>- Life of the party.</i>

You know, but that's valid.
Because if we're all gonna die anyway,

- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, is that bastard O'Bannion over there?
Yes. I hate that jerk.
Do you guys wanna get him back?
- Hell yes.
- Yeah!
<i>#Slow ride #</i>
<i># Take it easy #</i>
<i>They really sold it to you?</i>
- Of course.
- Cool.
<i># Take it easy ##</i>
There you go, buddy.
Whoo! Paycheck. Oh, yeah.
- Way to shoot, man.
- Thanks, bud.
Oh, yeah. He got it.
- I got your change.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.
- Got a beer for my partner.
- Yes, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Guys.
- Party at the moon tower.
- Oh, I'm there.
You and Benny pick up the first keg.
I'm goin' to collect for the rest.
Spread the word, man.
Max, Phil, party at the moon tower.
Hey, good game, man.
You too.
Y'all are an embarrassment
to the sport of pool...
and you should be proud
that I even let you play at my table.
You are the worst pool player
I've ever seen in my life...
<i>but if you keep watchin'me</i>
<i>you might learn somethin'!</i>
<i>Shit, you got so many balls on the table,</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to start knockin'your balls in...</i>
<i>just to get 'em out of my way.</i>
- Okay.
<i>- Corner pocket.</i>
- Hey, check this out.
<i>- Easy money.</i>
<i>God, you are terrible!</i>
<i>Okay, homo, I hope you are ready to taste</i>
<i>the agonizing, bitter humiliation of defeat.</i>
<i>You ready?</i>
So, did you hear
they're busting Carl Burnett out back?
- Whoa-whoa. What did you say?
- About what?
- Carl Burnett. What about him?
- I just heard he's gettin' busted. I don't know.
Benny, they got Burnett in the back.
Let's go.
<i>- Carl Burnett? Outside?</i>
<i>- Yeah. They got him.</i>
- Let's go.
- Let me finish this game.
- Fine. I'm gettin' out.
<i>- Hold him for me!</i>
<i>All right, all right!</i>
Hey, man. ThatJulie chick?
Loves you.
Oh, yeah.
You want her?
Gotta play it cool, you know.
Can't let her know how much you like her.
'Cause if she knows, she'll dump you like that.
Believe me.
If she asks you to ride out there with her,
you don't do it. Say, "Nah. Got my own ride.
But <i>maybe</i> I'll see you later."
Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
It works.
Whoo-ee! Whee!
We got another one, huh, fellas?
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Guys, guys.
You wouldn't mind if I went first, would ya?
Is that all right?
It's kind of a personal thing
between me and this little piece of shit here.
So... we meet again, huh?
Did y'all hear this little motherfucker's mom
pulled a shotgun on me this afternoon?
Fuckin' bitch.
Y- You haven't had
any licks yet, have you?
- Hmm?
- No.
Whoo!
Another cherry, boys.
Man, get the fuck up against the wall!
You have to be the dumbest freshman,
skinny little cocksucking son of a bitch...
<i>to be out here tonight.</i>
You knew I was gonna find you.
I would like to dedicate
this first lick...
to your mother...
fucker.
Not yet.
Oh! It's gettin' warmer.
What the fuck?
Remember me, you pig?
<i>#I walked through</i>
<i>the halls ofkarma #</i>
Let's go, man! Come on!
<i> What the fuck is the matter with you?</i>
<i>How 'bout some fucking backup?</i>
- Let's go!
- I'm hurryin'!
<i>Fuckin'scumbags!</i>
<i>It was beautiful! You should have seen</i>
<i>the look on that fuck's face!</i>
- Get in!
- We got that bastard!
Jesus!
You let that little fuck get away!
What is the matter with you?
It's fuckin' pitiful!
Fuck!
Freshman shitheads.
What the fuck are you lookin' at?
Huh?
I'll kick your fuckin' ass right now!
Pussy.
What are you smilin' at,
you little freshman faggot? Huh?
Fuck you.
Fuck all of you!
Fuck you!
Goddamn it!
Oh, man!
O'Bannion finally got
his paint job —Whoa!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I swore to God I'd never come
to a Top Notch...
and here I am sorting through
jalapeño burgers and soggy fries.
Here, take 'em.
<i>- All right, all right!</i>
<i>- Oh, Christ.</i>
How ya doin'?
- Pretty good.
- Cool.
You heard about the party
bein' busted, right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Not to worry.
There's a new fiesta in the making
as we speak.
It's out at the moon tower.
Full kegs. Everybody's gonna be there.
You oughta go.
Okay.
- Okay, we'll be there.
- Okay.
- Say, you need a ride?
- Uh, no, I got my own car.
- Thanks.
<i>- Yeah, well, listen.</i>
You oughta ditch the two geeks
you're in the car with now and get in with us.
But that's all right.
We'll worry about that later.
- I will see you there. All right?
- Bye.
I love those redheads, man.
I know you!
We had geography together.
Remember?
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God.
What a <i>dick!</i>
That was so creepy.
- Why are you smiling?
- I thought he was cute.
- Oh, that's disgusting!
- You thought he was cute?
Do you realize when he graduated
we were, like, three years old?
Oh, Cynthia, what are you thinking?
I don't know.
So, are we gonna still go?
- Yeah, what the hell.
- I guess.
Ohh! Get back!
<i># You show us everything you got #</i>
<i># You keep on dancin'</i>
<i>and the room gets hot #</i>
<i># You drive us wild #</i>
<i># We'll drive you crazy #</i>
Hey, Wood is here
for the quarter race, baby!
- Hey, Benny. You better have your wood screws —
- Fuck you!
'Cause I'm gonna blow your doors
completely off!
<i># You drive us wild</i>
<i>We'll drive you crazy #</i>
<i># You keep on shoutin'</i>
<i>You keep on shoutin'#</i>
<i>#I #</i>
<i># Wanna rock and roll all night #</i>
<i>#And party every day #</i>
<i>- #I wanna rock and roll all night #</i>
#And party every day ##
Yeah!
<i>#Deep in the south of Texas #</i>
<i>#Not so long ago #</i>
<i># There on a crowded island #</i>
<i>#In the Gulf of Mexico #</i>
<i>#It didn't take too much money #</i>
<i>#Man, but it sure was nice #</i>
<i># You could dance all night #</i>
<i>#If you felt all right #</i>
<i>#Drinkin'whiskey and throwin'dimes ##</i>
Well, someone's tokin' some reefer.
Take care of this.
Hey, man. Hey. Slow down. What's up?
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- What'd you just say?
When?
Just now, man, when you walked past.
What'd you say?
A- About what?
You said,
"Someone's tokin' some reefer."
No, I may have said something
about smelling some pot.
- You know, it was just an observation.
- Oh, an observation, huh?
Well, who the hell are you, man?
Isaac fuckin' Newton?
Well, guess what, genius.
<i>I'm</i> the one smoking marijuana, motherfucker.
- You got a problem with that?
- No. Of course not.
Then why'd you say that, chief? Don't let
your mouth write a check your butt can't cash.
So I'm blazin' with my friends.
So I'm a fuckin' pothead, man.
What's it to you? Huh?
What's the matter, pussy? Out of observations?
Why don't you observe while I punch
your teeth down your fuckin' throat!
Dude, relax! Relax!
He's cool, man. Relax.
Hey, I'll be watching you, Newton.
I only came here to do two things, man.
Kick some ass and drink some beer.
Looks like we're almost out of beer.
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.
<i>Why is it called the moon tower, anyway?</i>
Uh, I guess they decided to put it up out here
whenever they were building the power plant.
Actually, it's a good idea.
You got a full moon out here
every day of the year. You know?
Yeah, but nothing's ever been repaired...
so this whole place
could fall down at any time.
So you'd better
watch your step, junior.
This place used to be off limits, man,
'cause of some drunk freshman who fell off.
He went right down the middle,
smackin' his head on every beam, man.
I hear it doesn't hurt
after the first couple, though.
Autopsy said he had one beer, man.
How many did <i>you</i> have?
Four.
You're dead, man.
You're so dead.
Look at the bloodstains right there.
Shut up.
I'm gonna get that guy.
- What guy?
- That asshole on the way in — Clint.
Super-dominant male
in a '50s greaser uniform.
I wouldn't suggest that, Mike.
Look, man, I got it all planned out.
Most fights in places like this never get past
a punch or two before they're broken up.
There's almost a natural instinct
not to upset the herd.
So all I gotta do is get in one good punch,
play defense and wait.
- What?
- What are you talking about?
I- I-I guess at first I was relieved
to get out of the situation...
but now there's this level
of humiliation setting in...
that I can tell is gonna
be with me for-fucking-ever!
I'm just not gonna let this be
yet another situation...
which contributes to me being a little,
ineffectual nothing the rest of my life.
<i>Would you look at this fucking town, man.</i>
<i>It's dead.</i>
Imagine how many people
out there right now are fucking, man.
Step inside my head —
Just goin' at it.
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Remember me?
- Sure. You're Sabrina, right?
Right.
- How are you doing?
- Okay.
- Hey, let's go.
- What brings you here?
Oh, just hanging out.
- You having fun?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
So, uh — does your offer
from this afternoon still stand?
What am I say supposed to say?
"Anything you want."
<i>- #Do you, you #</i>
<i>#Feel like I do ##</i>
Why did we even come here?
I always feel a little out of place
at these things, you know.
You're telling me.
I'm being stalked by a Nazi.
Is that a little bit of reefer
I smell on you, boy?
Coach is right.
You're runnin' with that bad crowd again.
You've got an attitude adjustment
you've gotta make right now.
Like I'm the only athlete at this fuckin' party.
Look at you two drunks.
Coach is right, though.
Those guys don't care if we win or lose, bro.
Just remember that.
- Check this out. Watch this —
- Yeah?
Watch me get this beer. Watch.
Oh, no! It's the cops!
- Look! Look!
- Shit!
Look, look, look!
That was so easy.
Oh, shit.
He needs another drink, you know, bad.
All right!
<i>#I was in the right place #</i>
<i>#But it must have been the wrong time #</i>
<i>#I'd have said the right thing #</i>
<i>#But I must have used the wrong line #</i>
<i>#I went down the right trail #</i>
<i>#But I must have used the wrong car #</i>
<i>#Head is in a bad place #</i>
<i>#And I wonder what it's good for #</i>
<i>#I was in the right place #</i>
<i>#But it must have been the wrong time #</i>
<i>- #My head is in a bad place #</i>
- Hey! Mitch!
- Hey!
- How's it goin'?
I was wondering
if you were around here.
<i>#I been runnin', tryin'</i>
<i>It gets hung up in my mind ##</i>
Oh, man!
So, uh, I just wanted to talk, you know...
about you quittin' football.
Or is it just this pledge?
You don't wanna sign the pledge, right?
That's what it is.
I don't know, man.
Maybe I'm not into any of it anymore.
- You're not into any of it anymore.
- Yeah.
It'd be the biggest mistake of your life, Pink.
No one quits senior year, pal.
Especially if you're starting quarterback.
I mean, we got a shot at state.
We'll kick some butt this year.
It's what we've been working for
all of our lives, man.
Me and you. Benny.
We're gonna be champions together.
Look, man, all I'm saying is
that if I do play next year...
it's gonna be on my terms,
not theirs.
You just remember one thing, Pink—
it ain't just about you, pal,
it's about us — me, Donny, Mel.
You'd be fuckin' us over.
<i>Or maybe you'rejust fuckin'scared, huh?</i>
Have a nice night.
<i># Can't stay at home</i>
<i>Can't stay at school #</i>
<i># Old folks say</i>

<i>#Hello, Daddy</i>
<i>Hello, Mom ##</i>
#Watch them fly #
<i>#Away #</i>
<i> Do you guys know</i>
<i>what that song's about?</i>
<i>It's about aliens.</i>
We're the aliens, man.
We're the savages.
- We're the savages.
- Wait, man. That song is about that?
- Yeah, man, that song's about that.
- About aliens?
Yeah, man.
You didn't know that?
This country's founded — It was founded
by people who were into aliens, man.
George Washington, man, he was in a cult,
and the cult was into aliens, man.
- You didn't know that?
<i>- No.</i>
Oh, man, they were
way into that type of stuff, man.
It's like the every-other-decade theory.
You know?
The '50s were boring,
the '60s rocked...
and the '70s —
Oh, my God, they obviously suck.
Right? Come on.
Maybe the '80s will be radical.
You know?
I figure we'll be in our 20s
and, hey, it can't get any worse.
<i>#Here I come again now, baby #</i>
<i>#Like a dog in heat #</i>
<i># You can tell it's me</i>
<i>by the clamor now, baby #</i>
<i># Tide like a tapestry #</i>
<i>#Now, I been travelin'for so long #</i>
<i># You know I'm here to say ##</i>
Wait a minute.
Who put the keg way out here
in the woods?
I don't know. This is just
where they told me it would be.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Huh.
- I don't think we need beer anyway.
- George toked weed, man?
- Absolutely, George toked weed.
Are you kidding me, man?
He grew fields of that stuff.
That's what I'm talking about.
Fields!
- He grew that shit up at Mount Vernon, man.
- Mount Vernon? He grew it all over the country.
<i>He had people growin'it</i>
<i>all over the country.</i>
<i>The whole country back then was gettin'high.</i>
<i>Let me tell you, man.</i>
<i>'Cause</i>— <i>'Cause</i>— <i>'Cause he knew.</i>
<i>He was onto somethin', man.</i>
He knew that it would be a good
cash crop for the Southern states, man...
so he grew fields of it, man.
But you know what?
Behind every good man there's a woman.
And that woman
was Martha Washington, man.
And every day, George would come home,
she'd have a big, fat bowl waiting for him...
when he'd come in the door, man.
She was a hip — a hip, hip lady, man.
Mm-mmm.
Wait a minute.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
- What girlfriend?
- What's-her-name.
Simone. Hmm?
And she was real cool too.
She'd harvest the crops, man.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
She'd put it in the — in the, um, bushels
and stuff and sell it, you know.
Because they had to
make ends meet and stuff.
I mean, did you ever look
at a dollar bill, man?
There's some spooky stuff going on
on a dollar bill, man. And it's green too!
- Later.
- See ya.
- Cool.
<i>- Wait, wait, wait. What was that all about?</i>
- What were you doin' back there, guy?
- Exactly what you two clowns wish you were doin'.
- Look at him.
- Look at your boy.
<i>Kramer!</i>
<i> Yeah, you, you, you. Freshman.</i>
<i>Right here. Come on. Right here, buddy.</i>
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. What is this wave shit?
<i>- Freshman! Over here right now.</i>
- Over here. Now.
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.
<i>- Come on. Come on. Come on.</i>
- Shit. I should go.
- Yeah, I guess you probably should.
- Shit. I'll be back.
Okay.
- He's like a little Casanova.
- Yeah.
- It's amazing.
- Look at this shit-eating grin on his face.
- Was I right?
- Not bad for a little freshman.
But you better watch out
for them older girls.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here, come here, come here.
All right, all right.
We just wanna know something. Okay?
Are you gonna be fuckin' that later,
or are you gonna be a little wimp? Huh?
How do you know I haven't already?
Get outta here!
I think it's past your bedtime!
- Run along.
- Come here. Come here, come here.
Why don't you go get a ride with her.
Say we left you.
It'll work. It'll work. Go.
- Hey, Kramer. Show it to her.
- Yeah.
- Give it to her. Go!
- Go, boy.
Air raid, freshman.
What?
Air raid, freshman.
- Oh, come on, Darla. Leave her alone.
- No, Tony, this is between me and her.
And she'd better be on the ground
i- in five seconds.
<i>Wait, she doesn't have to air-raid</i>
<i>because she's with me. Okay?</i>
Air-raid, or it's your ass.
<i>Don't do it, Sabrina.</i>
<i>Oh, that's it...</i>
Miss Hot Stuff.
I'm gonna make the next year
of your life a living hell.
Lick me! All of you!
<i>Hey, Darla.</i>
Good for you.
Don't air-raid for that bitch.
I hate that shit.
It's like that Clint fucker
in front of all his friends.
- "Huh? Huh, motherfucker?"
<i>- All right! Okay, Mike.</i>
Dominant male monkey motherfucker!
God!
<i>T-A-R-A.</i>
I never met a Tara before.
You're my first.
Hey, what the —
<i>All right!</i>
- He did it! I can't believe it!
- Fuckin' knew I should have kicked your ass!
Come on! Come on, man!
- Come on! Hold still!
- Yeah!
<i>- Stop now!</i>
- Oh, yeah! Hold still!
- You guys, come on.
- It's that Clint. That crazy bastard.
<i>- You like this? You like this, motherfucker?</i>
- Come on, Clint! Come on!
Where you goin'?
<i>Whoo-hoo! </i>
<i>Kick his ass!</i>
Come on, man! You want some more?
You fuckin' bitch!
Come on, man! Come here!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Get off him!
- Get the fuck off me!
<i>- Come on!</i>
- Come on. Stay down!
- Fuckin' dick! You fucking fascist!
You got fuckin' smoked!
Come on, man! You want some more?
Fuckin' dick!
Hey.
Hey, little brother.
- Is that a beer in your hand?
- Why, yes, it is.
Have you had more
than one of those tonight?
A few, I guess,
but nobody's counting.
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi.
Guess I might as well just get used to you
being at the same social functions as me, huh?
And, uh, hanging out
with people I know?
What time are you
supposed to be home, anyway?
Oh, geez, I don't know.
Couple hours ago.
That's bullshit.
That's major bullshit.
Mom barely let me out of the house
when I was your age.
- Aww!
- "Aww!"
Don't think she's not gonna be waiting up
for you when you get home, because she will be.
- I've been through it, and she's tough.
- Yeah, well —
Just don't ask her
to take it easy on me, please.
What's that supposed to mean?
Take it easy on him?
- Let's go smoke that joint.
- He's in for a surprise.
<i>- # Tuesday's gone #</i>
<i># With the wind #</i>
<i>- # Tuesday's gone with the wind ##</i>
- All right! Good.
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Hey, man, no worries.
- Take care.
- All right.
- Pick you up tomorrow, 4:00?
- Okay.
Hey.
Aerosmith. Three weeks.
Front row seats, babe.
All right. I won't forget.
So, uh, who's buying breakfast?
- Not me.
- I will, I guess.
- You coming along?
- Sure.
- Night, John Boy. Ali.
- Good night.
"Wood-a-been."
What's going on?
<i>Pink, my man.</i>
<i>What's happenin'?</i>
- Not a lot.
- Cynthia, man?
- I like her, man. Very nice.
- Yeah?
- Red's a good color for you.
- My favorite color.
- Have you seen Jodi around?
- Man, she left your ass.
Really?
Well, you win some, you lose some.
<i>What about Peter Frampton?</i>
- I like him.
- Hey!
- Slater, what's happenin', man?
- What's goin' on, man?
- Guys, what's goin' on?
- Nothing!
- Pickford, what do you know?
- What time is it? God.
Let's go smoke a joint, man!
On the 50-fuckin'- yard line,
in honor of your daddy, Coach Conrad.
We're there! Great idea!
- The man with the plan.
- Wanna come with me?
Okay.
Hey.
Joint subcommittee meeting
on the 50 yard line in 15. You there?
- Okay.
<i>- Don, y'all ride with me, man.</i>
<i>Let's hit it.</i>
- This is cashed, man.
- It's in there, man.
You can ride with us, man, but you're
ridin' in the back, 'cause I got shotgun.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- H-Hey!
Hey, hey, hey! Watch the leather, man!
Oh, fuck it!
<i>- Don't you quit! Do you wanna hit him?</i>
<i>- He was wide open!</i>
<i>- Do you want to hit him?</i>
<i>- Jesus, son! You're wearing Rebel gray!</i>
- Now, break down! Break down!
- I'm sorry, Coach.
I want you on him like stink on shit!
I say, stink on shit!
Break down! You don't deserve
to wear that Rebel gray, boy!
You don't deserve to wear it!
You won't hit him? You won't hit him?
O.T.S.S!
Only the strong survive!
- Only the strong survive!
- Only the strong survive, boy!
- Only the strong survive!
- That's it!
Now, where's your pitch man?
Hit your goddamn pitch man!
He fumbles!
Hey, man!
Hell, my grandmother
can hit harder than that!
What the fuck, man?
Course, she's an 8 foot 4,
652-pound, hairy-ass gorilla...
drives a Mack truck
and runs the 40 in 10.2.
Hell, she's gotten bigger lately, man.
She was only 6'2", 195 in my day.
<i>Still drives that Mack truck though.</i>
Hey, Pink,
you got my papers, man?
Uh, yeah, there's some
in my glove compartment.
I got 'em. Hit me on a slant.
Give me the keys to an inside.
Hut. Down!
Marijuana on one!
Reefer on two!
Hut! Hut!
<i>- Wide open!</i>
I got it! Sweet!
Oh!
<i>That's pretty good.</i>
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.
Could be, like, a little — I don't know.
Maybe perhaps a little more symmetrical.
- Does that hurt?
- Oww!
- Yes! PI — It —
- Sorry. Sorry.
- It's a bruise.
- Okay.
I don't know.
Let me ask you something, though.
I mean, I got some
pretty good ones in there.
I mean, it's not like I —
You wouldn't say I got my ass kicked, right?
Oh, no. You know —
I don't know.
After a couple years, people won't even
remember, really, who won or lost.
Yeah — No, you're right.
You read about, like, Jackson Pollock
or Ernest Hemingway—
You never read about who won or lost,
just, they got into a brawl.
Right. Exactly.
Well, uh, thanks for the ride
and breakfast and everything.
No problem.
Sure is nice to pile on some pancakes and syrup
after a night of beer drinking, isn't it?
Um —
Good night.
Good night.
<i>- Hope you're not grounded or anything.</i>
- Thanks.
<i>"Not to indulge in any alcohol,</i>
<i>drugs, sex after 12:00...</i>
or any other illegal activity—"
- Oh, not my shadow.
- Slater, pay me for that.
- Found that in your glove compartment, man.
- You're the third person who's given me this today.
God.
<i>What do you reckon you're gonna do?</i>
I don't know. I'll probably end up signing it.
I just don't wanna give in so easy.
Man, it's the same bullshit
they tried to pull in my day.
If it ain't that piece of paper, it's some
other choice they're gonna try and make for ya.
You gotta do what Randall "Pink" Floyd
wants to do, man.
And let me tell you this —The older you do get,
the more rules they're gonna try to get you to follow.
You just gotta keep livin', man.
L- I-V-I-N.
Man, if you're gonna
sign that paper, man...
you should throw a little grass
right in the middle, roll it up, sign the joint, man.
- That's gonna tell 'em something.
<i>- That's what I'll do. Assholes.</i>
Yeah, they're all assholes. But think about it.
We've had a lot of good times right here, Pink.
<i> Yeah, I mean, come on, Pink.</i>
<i>I can't believe this.</i>
You act like you're so oppressed.
Man, you guys are kings of the school.
You get away with whatever you want.
What are you bitching about?
Look, all I'm saying is, if I ever start referring
to these as the best years of my life...
remind me to kill myself.
All I'm saying is,
I just wanna look back and say...
that I did it the best I could
while I was stuck in this place...
<i>had as much fun as I could</i>
<i>when I was stuck in this place...</i>
<i>played as hard as I could</i>
<i>when I was stuck in this place...</i>
<i>dogged as many chicks as I could</i>
<i>when I was stuck in this place.</i>
Yeah, right,
Mr. Premature Ejaculation.
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
- That's good, baby.
<i>- You know it's true.</i>
<i>- Is that the cops?</i>
- What the hell?
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>
- Hey! All of you!
Get over here!
<i>- Now!</i>
- Hey, man, ditch that pot.
Is it illegal to be on the football field?
- I got some more in this fuckin' bag.
- Dump it, dump it, dump it.
Come on, Slater.
What'd we do?
You got any Visine?
<i>Man, I can't believe this.</i>
<i> If it ain't ol'Richard Wrath.</i>
<i>How you doin', Dick?</i>
Well, well, well.
Couple of football players.
Wonder what Coach
is gonna think of all this.
Line up.
- Wooderson.
- Slavey.
Relivin' old glories
on the football field?
Get through there!
You shouldn't still be mad
'cause I got all-district and you didn't.
<i>#Sweet days of summer #</i>
<i># Thejasmine's in bloom #</i>
<i>#July is dressed up #</i>
<i>#And playing her tune #</i>
<i>#And I come home #</i>
<i>#From a hard day's work #</i>
<i>#And you're waiting there #</i>
<i>#Not a care #</i>
<i>#In the world ##</i>
What?
Floyd! Dawson!
Get your scrawny butts over here.
<i>Mornin', Coach.</i>
So what the hell's goin' on?
Why am I gettin' wake-up calls from the cops?
- That was nothin'. They just left just now.
- False alarm, Coach.
Come here, Randy.
Come here.
You been out with those losers
all night?
Hey, Coach Conrad.
Remember me?
Second period gym class?
That's the kind of people
I was telling you about.
Trouble like this means nothing to that bunch
of clowns. You're the one with something to lose.
- Coach, you don't even know them.
- Randy—
How can you even pretend
to talk that way? Huh?
Okay, Randy, I shouldn't do this, but I'm willing
to wipe the slate clean and forget about all this.
I want you to get your priorities straightened out,
quit hanging out with that bunch of hoodlums...
and sign your commitment
to your team.
- Have you done that yet?
- I'm still thinkin' about it.
No one's paying you to think about it.
Just do it, son!
You know, Coach...
I gotta get going.
Me and my loser friends,
we gotta go get Aerosmith tickets.
Top priority of the summer.
Oh, uh, Coach, uh, I forgot.
I might play ball...
but I will never sign that.
<i>Let's rock and roll.</i>
All right, man! Livin'!
Shit, I'm gettin' my third wind.
Let's get on the road.
- Let's go. You gonna come, man?
- Shotgun!
Talk to you later, then.
- You guys not goin'?
- Can I use your keys?
- Yeah.
- Time to boogie on outta here.
- Hey.
- Let's do it.
So that's that, huh?
All right.
Slate. Aah!
I never get shotgun.
Uh, hi, Mom.
Mmm, okay, Mitchell.
This is your one
get-out-of-jail-free card...
so I hope you enjoyed it.
No.
Your sister told me everything,
so I've decided to make this deal with you.
I'm — I'm gonna be open-minded
about it this time.
But... next time
you come in at sunrise...
we've got problems.
And, uh, who is this older girl
who gave you a ride?
She's just, like —
Have you been drinking?
No!
Are you drunk?
