Relax.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's not my thing to scare
you half to death.
S & M is based on trust.
Trust me.
I've never hurt anyone.
You see, a woman like you...
What's your name again?
Ai.
Such a woman as pure and innocent
as you, Ai,
is a rarity in this country
today.
You're a treasured flower.
Those cunts who fuck around
while still in school...
always end up marrying
doctors or politicians...
Those are the real whores to me.
You are beautiful.
You understand?
Not the mask, please.
trust me, I won't hurt you.
Don't move.
If the needle breaks, you'll die.
Hello?
Yes.
The New Prince Hotel, 6 O'clock.
Mr. Ishioka,
he's under the name of Sato...
No, it's alright there's a
few things I can do in the meantime.
Good morning.
I can read what you need to do,
but you must follow these three things
to be a successful young woman.
The first one,
I see a TV and under it a..
telephone book.
I will put one there.
Second,
don't plan on visiting the museum
in the east of the city.
There is a big mist
in this direction,
any single woman would get lost there
forever.
And third, buy a pink stone,
and make it into a ring,
wear it on your middle finger
as a good luck charm.
If you respect these three rules,
God will grant you happiness.
Can you do this?
Yes.
Thanks for your patience.
please sit down.
I looked at what we have,
and I'd like to recommend you
this pink imperial topaz.
It's me, Ai.
I've just got here.
He wants me for 3 hours, for now.
I'm at your disposal, sir.
Come here.
On your knees.
Yes, Master.
Spare me the "Master".
We are two adults here,
this isn't some kids game.
Sorry, I understand.
Your hair.
One of the most important
things of a woman is her hair.
I understand why the Nazi's
cut off all the women's hair.
Go ahead, stand in the window.
Please, can you draw the curtains?
I want them open, I get my
pleasure by humiliating you.
You understand?
Now, move your ass slowly
as you
take off your panties.
Slowly.
only five millimeters at a time.
Not like that.
Do it like a horny business
woman.
You know, the ones who are just
aching for a good fuck.
Look at all those people down there.
Business women, secretaries.
They're everywhere
women starving for a good fuck
Imagine that's what you want.
You'll keep doing this till
your pussy is all wet.
You'll never get wet like that!
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing!
-- Don't ever laugh!
-- I'm sorry, I won't do it again.
You're just a cunt aching for
a fuck.
A bitch in heat.
When a bitch is in heat, she
doesn't ever laugh.
You understand.
I'll be better.
Do it over again!
Again.
Good, again.
Again.
sorry...
There it is.
No, no.
Nice and slow!
Look, you're all wet.
Feeling better?
Isn't this what you wanted?
Say:
"I am you're horny secretary."
I am you're horny secretary.
Say it louder!
I am you're horny secretary.
Louder!
Louder!
What? Right now?
Hold on I'll ask her.
It's my wife.
she's wants to have a little fun.
She wants to come over,
what do you say?
A threesome, huh?
That's extra, it'll be
100 more an hour.
So it's ok? You'll do it?
She said it's fine, come over.
What were you doing before
I came in?
Nothing.
It looked like sign language?
Are you a social worker?
I study sign language.
Once in a while I go to an
orphanage.
I learned it just so I can
talk to them, they are so lonely.
You want me dressed like this?
No, I want you naked.
-- I'm going to take a shower.
-- Wait a second!
Sit down.
How old are you?
Twenty--two.
Twenty--two...
So you've lived for twenty--two
years.
And in all those years,
you must've learned a few things.
Do you understand?
Not like:
how the earth turns on it's axis,
or how DNA forms a spiral.
What have you learned about yourself?
I discovered that I have no talent.
none whatsoever.
I'm forty--four years old.
I've learned a lot of things.
Done many, many things.
But there is a thing
which I found out...
about myself...
You know what it is?
I learned I'm a real horny guy.
Go take a shower.
Yeah, it's me.
You heard what happened?
They're mad as hell over
the Yamato deal.
Yeah, they have Yoshizaki.
Don't start chickening out now
you bastard.
Yes, I talked to Yuko.
Close the Singapore account.
They took a razor to Yoshizaki's
face.
Yeah, close it out.
Take everything, up to the last penny.
You need to send your
family far away from here.
We'll talk again soon.
Yeah alright.
It's just for the weekend.
You should come with me.
Take your passport.
What was that?
Make-up?
I'll buy it for you over there.
You don't want Hong Kong make-up?
Good God...
Yeah, she's here.
She gives better head than you.
You're not jealous?
You say you can do better than her?
You want to have a little competition?
This is turning me on.
Come over.
One minute.
Tell her yourself.
It's my wife. she's downstairs.
Talk to her.
What's happening up there?
Tell her, she'll really like
what we've been doing.
I have a vibrator...
You have a vibrator in your
cunt?
Is it tied up so you can't take it out?
Yes.
Are you on your knees?
I'm beginning to get wet.
Yes...
I bet he's on coke,
He's up to his old tricks again.
I can hear your vibrator.
I can't wait to go up.
I'll stuff your face in my
cunt as he's fucking me.
You're going to love every minute
of this.
Push your ass against the mirror.
Move your ass back and forth.
Slower.
You're a dirty bitch,
Dying to get fucked.
Keep fucking that mirror,
While we watch you.
Sure is nasty, huh?
You want some too?
Don't you?
It's so good!
You want it,
Don't you?
Answer her.
I know you want it.
Get ready to suck his cock.
I'm going.
I'll see you soon.
You gave me too much.
You earned it.
Wait.
Listen to me, you're wrong.
Don't ever say you have no talent.
It's only an excuse for yourself,
you're very special.
Good luck.
Mr. Ishioka.
Mr. Ishioka.
Where is it?
You lose something?
It's not ours.
It's better than having a boyfriend.
Stop it, Yoko.
Mr. Sato isn't here.
Can I take a message?
Has he checked out?
No, he's still registered.
Thank you.
Are you an "S" or an "M", sir?
Both?
Very well.
Looking here..
I see you are the newest club
member.
How's our little girl.
Why'd you buy such an expensive ring?
340.000?
You spent everything you
earned in one night with that!
I would've just bought one
at the flea market.
I was afraid a cheap ring
wouldn't work.
How can you believe in any of that
non--sense.
Ai, Miyuki, there is a threesome
for today.
800 for both of you?
What hotel?
The New Prince. room 1124.
Hello? Yes.
They will be there in half
an hour.
Your room number?
1124. Very well.
You go first.
Wait!
Let her go!
You were lucky,
I hope you're ok.
When I finished getting dressed,
I'll meet up with you.
Thank you.
If we run into any trouble,
we can call the cops.
I want to cum again, let's
go one more time, ready?
Let your little cock have a rest,
you couldn't handle that again.
It's all rested and ready for more.
Please, it's ready for a new game.
You strangle me...
and it'll go like this.
Strangle you?
Exactly,
I'll get hard as a rock.
You strangle me,
and the other jerks me off!
On your mark, get set, go!
I'm Kermit the frog...
Stop.
Don't stop!
When I say stop, do it harder.
Stop.
Stop.
Oh my god.
I'm calling for help.
I think he just OD'd on crack.
His pupils?
The black part of the eyes?
Let me see...
they are dilated.
Let's get out of here.
Don't leave anything behind.
That was crazy...
I saw my mother who died last year.
She said to me:
"Go to the light, you idiot!"
Well, you ready to do that again?
Here's your ring.
Thank you...
Isn't it too big for your finger?
You should take it back to
make it a little smaller.
Shida reporting.
From one of the largest
buildings ever in Tokyo.
Look at that thing.
Isn't it gigantic?
Are we done?
Oh well, back to the studio, then.
Are you ready, Miss Sanae?
Back now to "Super Cool Guys"
with Miss Sanae.
Many our artists work only in Japan.
But not, Mr. Sudo.
How often do you work in London?
Only six months a year.
Are there things you can
only get in London?
Yes, they have better hardware.
What do you mean?
I use a lot of acoustic instruments.
And he does not stay any more a lot
of studios for this in Japan.
And the sound mixing technicians
are far better there.
Well if that's the case, Mr. Sudo...
Quit calling me Mister.
Just talk to me normal.
Are you staying in Japan for awhile?
Just till my son finishes his
finals.
What about your home in Yokohama?
I sold it.
My new home is in London now...
Miyuki where are you,
We haven't heard from you.
Have you been sick, or what?
There's this man he's our best
client.
I really need you, Ai.
If he really likes you,
he'll pay double, even triple.
He's not into anything weird either,
he just likes to talk to girls.
He's really a nice guy.
I come here three times a week.
Go ahead, you can eat.
You know, this restaurant
is famous.
A lot of movie stars come here,
it's a fancy place.
Really.
How is the wine?
Excellent.
It's a Château Mouton
Rothschild, 1979.
It's an expensive wine.
I order that wine at least
three times a week.
I must be they're best customer!
Was it last year?
Suzanne Mildonian...
How well I remember..
A harp concerto by
Ms. Suzanne Mildonian.
She played in a small hall
at the Opera house of Vienne.
It was splendid...
Nobody can play the way she can.
Can I get you something else,
Mister?
No, no, this is excellent.
All that I want,
is for her to smile.
Is the Boss here?
No, he's in Singapore, for business.
Oh, Mount Fuji,
The holiest of mountains...
My fantasy is to rape
a dead woman.
It's called necrophilia.
It's been one of my fantasies
forever.
I want you to play the role...
of Umeko Yoshida,
which was raped near the Mount Fuji,
On April 19th, 1957.
She was killed then raped
by Toshio Yasaka,
He was her neighbor.
I'm going to choke you just a little,
and you'll pretend...
that your dead.
First I'll examine you,
then I'll rape you.
I'll pay you extra for rape.
Are you ready to get raped,
Umeko?
In the forest
at the foot of Mount Fuji?
Umeko!
I can't do this, I'm leaving.
Then give me back my money.
You saw him on television?
For the first time
in six months?
I'd be much to shy to date
a star like that.
You two seemed so happy.
I want to see him again.
I shouldnt?
You'll get hurt again.
He never told me it was over,
or that he didnt love me anymore.
Maybe he didn't mean it.
Ai, I have a very special client
on the phone.
Will you take him?
Are you sure you're up to it?
Yes.
I'll see you.
This time, don't leave
during your session.
- What's your name?
- Ai.
Me, I'm Saki.
Well turtle-head, are you glad
she's so pretty?
You must address him as
turtle-head.
Look at him, doesn't he look
like a turtle?
I didn't know there would be
three of us here.
I am sorry,
It was his idea, he likes to watch
two women get off on each other.
I promise, I won't do anything
you won't like.
Why don't you go take a shower.
There is a dress in there.
put that on..
And the hat also.
Tell me how's your business going?
I've heard that real estate
is really in a slump.
That's true, Mistress Saki.
But my society has a motto:
"Onward and Upward",
I could tell you to thrust ahead.
Nothing succeeds like success.
How beautiful!
How becoming it is on you.
How do you like your new outfit, Ai?
It's lovely.
I want you sit over in that chair.
Look, turtle-head,
you finally have a second mistress
One who looks good in a fancy dress.
it's your lucky day.
Greet your Mistress.
Dear Mistress Ai,
will you train me with discipline?
And what is your first request,
turtle-head?
I would love to kiss her feet?
You want to kiss her feet?
Yes.
And what do you think of his request, Ai?
Will you grant him permission?
You have your permission.
Just the bottom.
Bad turtle-head, you went too far
Come here.
Discipline is next.
Have a drink and relax.
You are pathetic.
Give me your neck.
Come closer.
Good.
Did I say that you could lick my pussy?
Say: "I'm sorry."
Look at me!
Forgive me!
Say that you're sorry.
Forgive me.
- "I'm sorry."
- Forgive me.
Say "I am sorry"!
Forgive me!
"I'm sorry."
I'm sorry, Mistress Saki.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired of playing with you.
Get away from me, get back.
That's far enough.
Stay there just like a rock.
Lift up a little.
What do you think you're doing?
You're very bad, you'll be punished.
Ai...
Take a look at this,
he's bald as a turtle.
How embarrassing!
You're really wet.
You like this?
Try and cum if you can.
You can enjoy it, just relax.
Good. Now I want you to pee.
You'll feel much better.
Bring the chamber pot.
Very well, turtle-head,
take the pot and stand back.
Stand back!
Keep going!
Knock it off turtle,
Keep going.
Don't let it spill.
That's far enough.
Now, turtle-head,
Drink it up to the last drop.
I can't.
I can drink only yours.
I can only drink your pee,
Mistress Saki.
Pity!
If you drink all of it,
you'll be rewarded.
I expect the bowl to be dry!
Drink everything.
Up to the last drop.
Here is your reward.
Raise your ass.
No. It hurts.
You like this, Don't you?
Admit it you love this, turtle-head.
If you don't cum,
I'll punish you again.
See you soon.
Good night, Miss.
Will you join me for dinner?
Yes, what else?
And what about the other one?
I see.
Very well.
I want asparagus
and the smoked salmon.
And what about the other one?
Angel hair pasta.
Yes, we'll be there soon.
You enjoy it?
Yes.
Keep the smoke in your lungs.
It's sweet.
For somebody who doesnt smoke,
you learn how to do it very quickly.
You must be rich.
Not really.
It's this country who has money.
But it's not proud of it's wealth.
It drives our men to masochism
out of anxiety.
It's from these men
that I earn my living.
And I can say that I'm proud of it.
It's time for some music.
<i>I can only sigh.</i>
<i>Your soft kisses</i>
<i>and my beating heart</i>
<i>Get lost in dreams of love.</i>
<i>There, on this gold beach,</i>
<i>On burning sand,</i>
<i>We'll make love to each other</i>
<i>to the sound of foghorns.</i>
<i>Our tanned bodies pressed
on one another.</i>
<i>And we'll make solemn promises.</i>
<i>Let us keep our secrets forever.</i>
<i>Oh, how I sigh!</i>
<i>Ah, the ultimate joy of love,</i>
<i>Is like the color of roses...</i>
<i>The first time I saw you</i>
<i>It was love at first sight!</i>
That was great!
Yes?
A few years ago I fell in love
with someone.
And you're still in love with him?
I want to go to see him,
but he's married now.
I'm too scared.
You need to take charge of your life.
You need to find him and see him.
You need to confront your problems.
That's what I always say
If you don't do it.
You'll always regret it.
When you've confronted that
part of your life,
The future is yours!
This blood...
the same blood which ran
as the creatures that came out of
the sea.
The first ones to come to the earth.
I also, want to evolve.
They say that you evolve in life,
and I want to say the same.
Thank you for everything.
I'm going to go see him.
Farewell.
Wait.
This will give you courage.
You'll have the strength of lions.
You're giving this to me?
Farewell.
Take care of yourself.
It's a bit complicated.
Follow the street
by the outskirt of the nursery school.
I'll draw you a map.
I didn't know there was a harbor
near here?
Don't you hear foghorns?
Have you been drinking?
No.
Thank you.
Sudo!
What are you doing out here?
Grandma, call the police!
Call them right away!
Sudo...
Miss Sakakibara?
Yes, it's definitely you.
Yes.
You came to see him?
I'm sorry,
He left last year on a
journey of no return.
I was once the greatest singer
there was.
Didn't you know that.
We were rivals at one time.
But currently, we are friends.
Would you like to hear me sing?
This bench is my stage.
I'm so happy
that you all came tonight.
Good morning!
Good morning.
Why don't we all sing together.
Good morning!
Good morning.
Can't we sing a little louder.
Good morning!
Yes. Good morning.
Madam they're going to be mad
at me.
Let's go back. Please.
Were friends now, arent we?
Where does Mr. Sudo live?
Sudo!
What happened? What's your name?
Where are you from?
She didn't break into the house.
-- Look at this!
-- This belongs to you?
I think she tried to go up to the
ladder and she fell.
Are you hurt?
Say something.
Who are you anyway?
She smells of alcohol.
She's acting like shes drunk.
Wait!
She's a friend.
Leave her.
Shouldn't we take her in.
Didn't she used to be a singer.
I heard she went crazy...
After her husband died...
