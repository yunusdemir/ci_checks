You don't know how lucky you are, Trinity.
I had to let you leave jail!
And you belonged there!
Oh, yes, you do.
Both of those horses you sold were stolen.
But everyone says the thief
was a fair-haired man.
And no matter what kind of a double-crossing
son of a bitch you are...
... I know one thing is certain.
You ain't no blonde, Trinity.
Here's that fifty dollars you brought with you.
But I got to deduct forty-nine of it.
Seeing as how you ain't guilty.
You got to pay for your board and lodging.
I'm giving you this change so you know we
treat our prisoners fair and square in El Cerrito.
I'll keep this for our collection.
Now you got half an hour to clear out of town.
I want my water bottle.
Oh, yeah.
Here. Now get.
And don't let me see you around here again.
Say, boy. Why do they call you Trinity?
'Cause I was born in Trinidad, of course.
- No, señora, it's impossible.
- But it's no matter to you...
No, señora, I cannot do it.
Give me a tortilla.
Señora --
I've paid you so many times.
Why can't you do it for me?
- Now, don't take it the wrong way.
- Gracias, señor.
Howdy, partner!
I've been waiting for almost a week now...
... betreathed to that girl... you know,
the one I met at the saloon.
She told me you were bound to get
out by the end of the month.
Well, so I just set myself
down here to welcome you.
'Cause Sartana always stands by his partners.
And so does Trinity.
I hope we never meet each other again.
But if we do, stand aside. It's wiser.
You know it ain't polite to steal
a gun off an old friend.
You can have it back. Don't worry.
Just don't worry.
Oh, I ain't worried, alright!
Just so long as you swear not to use it on me!
I won't shoot you. I promise.
That ain't enough, Trinity. I said swear.
That's better. Now I know I can trust you.
Well, have you thought it over?
- Yeah.
- Well, what have you decided?
No.
My, you sure are a tough critter.
Say, do you know how many people
work for that new railroad company?
- No.
- Well, I'll tell you.
I know 'cause I've seen them.
I've robbed their trains dozens of times.
That a fact?
At a rough guess, I figure there's at
least a thousand fellows working for them.
Work? Slaves.
I'm not through talking.
So hold your horses til I finish.
Just listen to me.
And remember, I was never fond of work either.
What I want to go for is their payroll.
Just let me tell you. I got it all worked out.
At about an average of four dollars a day
per head, see, that's a total payment of...
... more than twenty thousand bucks every pay day.
Just waiting there for someone to take it.
No, it's not the kind of job that suits me.
I spend six weeks looking through the bars at El Cerrito.
And I've got scars on my backside to prove it.
I thought you said you wanted
to get back to Trinidad.
How else can you do it?
Enough money to go home, with class.
You may never get another chance if you let this one go.
With the plan I've got in mind, we can't miss.
My old man, I tell you,
he'd have been downright proud.
Just where do we find this twenty thousand dollars?
I think you forgot the pepper.
Look over there. What's that look like?
It's a bank.
One thing I'll say for the railroad. When it comes
to paying, they've always been very punctual.
They got a good reputation. I'd really
enjoy dealing with that kind of client.
My hat! My hat!
When I say it's my hand, it's my hand.
Who's the funny man?
Who's the smartass? I'll make him pay for it.
Clyde!
Put away that damn shooting iron. If you say you
won, I'm sure Timothy don't want to argue.
Too late now, mister.
The big man's coming on strong.
- For me, too.
- You've played your last hand.
- You know those two fellows?
- No, I don't.
- What do you say we have a drink?
- Yeah.
Anybody who shoots like that,
you've got to keep an eagle eye on.
- If you say so, Burton.
- Yes.
There, you're right on schedule. Let's see.
- Get Ms. Maribel --
- I hope you had a pleasant journey.
- Isn't this Maribel's?
- Yeah.
I'll take the things for Ms. Maribel.
And where's the other one?
I'm sure there's another one.
Wake him.
Rise and shine, Sambo.
Where's that smartass pal of yours?
You heard. Where's your cowpoke friend?
In town, I think. Why?
No questions.
All you have to do is answer.
Where is that blonde bastard?
Can I put my boots on?
Put them on, but be careful how you move.
No more guessing games, stranger.
We'll just wait right here for your pal to show up.
It is very unkind waking up
your neighbors like that.
And it ain't very good manners.
Makes the second time today that you
and that crazy blonde got the best of me.
Did you want to ask me something?
There won't be a third time.
Down, boy.
You think these men here were
sent by the local sheriff?
No.
I think they ought to go for a little walk when
they wake up. What do you think?
Okay.
I'll take care of their horses.
We got to get moving, so let's get out of here.
What's that for?
There's some digging we have to do.
Did you kill him, Sartana?
No time to explain now. We got to move on.
Good. It's right on time.
A stagecoach with the railroad payroll.
Can't work, dear.
What can't work, that ridiculous game of solitaire?
No, your hold-up.
I can see it all here in these cards.
Goddammit.
I wish you'd shut up about those cards.
Just for once.  Don't you think I've already got
enough trouble...
... when I'm surrounded by such a
bunch of brainless knuckleheads?
You called me, Mr. Burton?
No. No, I didn't call you.
And why aren't you watching
the bank like I told you to?
You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Burton.
I should have everything right under control.
Get out of here!
You don't have to act like that
with Clark, do you hear?
He's my brother, Burton. Just remember
who you're speaking to.
I've told you that before.
Sure, yeah, I know he's your brother, but nerves
can get you down...
... when you think of all that dang money
that's at stake. Your brother should realize --
Yes, yes. You don't have to go on.
My brother fell on his head when he
was a little fellow, so I guess that's --
Oh, no, dear. I'm not interested in hearing your
family history all over again right now!
No, sirree.
This is the moment to pray that everything
finishes up the way it's supposed to.
You haven't got a chance.
Go on, Sheriff. Give me a hand, will you?
Let's get this gold locked up, eh?
Sure thing, Willie. Ain't no use letting temptation
lie around.
Ah, you've made it after all.
I had a funny feeling you fellows were going to
get held up on the way here.
I was so worried, I slept right here last night.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare, like someone
was hitting my head with a hammer.
Funny, I usually sleep good.
Usually.
I reckon I worry too much.
- Now, how'd you two boys like a little whiskey?
- Not a bad idea.
Thank you.
That bottle of yours ain't
never empty, Mr. Scarret.
- To health, then!
- Health!
To you.
Mr. Scarret, how about signing this receipt?
It's for eighteen thousand dollars. Six sacks of
three thousand each, in silver.
There's another formality, I got to count it.
And you can help me put it away in the strongbox.
- It's a pleasure.
- Sure.
Them lowdown, stinkin' varmints.
No good, dirty sons of --
If I ever get to drop on them again, they
won't even have time for breath.
I'll show them they can't
trick Killer Clyde like that!
Why, them coyotes ain't nothing but
a pair of horse thieves.
If I ever get my hands on that blonde bastard,
I'll beat him so black and blue...
... he'll be two shades darker than his pal.
How much further is it?
We've been walking for two hours.
Oh, shut your mouth. Keep the dust out.
- You counted this one?
- Yes.
Let's hurry.
Oh, God, that nightmare!
Leave your guns where they are.
Don't try anything.
Oh, God!
It's only a bit of cash I'm after.
And if you don't run on me, you won't get hurt.
As long as you boys behave good and cooperate,
you don't have a worry in the world.
Now just hand it over.
Good. Everything's going according to my plan.
As soon as the sheriff leaves, me and the boys
go into action.
Don't forget, eh? The name is Sartana.
- Why, you son of a --
- Careful. Mind your manners.
Still got you covered, old-timer.
Get him.
- Goddammit!
- How the hell did he do that?
I don't understand it.
How could he get away with --
We had him trapped.
Son of a bitch!
Damn. Damn, damn, damn it all!
What's going on?
I don't get it.
Something must've gone wrong down there.
That's what the cards were told.
And they never made a mistake.
Why don't you go to hell
and take your cards with you?
- What's going on?
- Sartana!
- Sartana? What?
- He just robbed the bank.
That's very good wine.
But we won't be making any more of it.
Why? Can't you grow good grapes here?
- Hey, Martha.
- Yeah?
Get some more for our guest.
Sure!
We can grow them, but where are we going to do it?
We've all been booted off our land.
All on account of that fellow, Burton.
Because everybody here owes him money
and we ain't got any.
He made us pay for water, he made us pay
for pasture...
He made us pay double on all our
seeds and provisions.
And he made us pay interest on the money, too!
And when the bills had gotten so big,
he claimed all our land.
Here, Father.
There you go.
You might as well enjoy it, friend.
Otherwise it'll just end up in Burton's hands
along with the rest of our things.
He's already threatened to send his men
against us. He says we got to pay up or get out.
How much do you owe this guy?
The total is about seven or eight thousand dollars.
No, it comes to eight thousand,
two hundred and six, Jeremiah.
It comes out to exactly that.
And not one penny more.
Pappy does our accounts.
Can I have some more?
Help yourself.
Here.
Well, it shouldn't be very difficult
to find eight thousand dollars.
It's a mortal sin to leave the land that
can produce a drink like this.
- Your health!
- To your health!
It's a pity we have to go, but by now,
we can just pray, that's all.
And even miracles don't come that big.
Why, all of us put together couldn't
scrape up more than a handful of dollars.
Why, nothing's too big for a miracle.
As long as you put your faith in Divine Providence.
That should be enough for your land.
My people, too, in my islands,
had to pay a ransom.
We're all brothers and drinkers.
Well, come on. Cheer up.
Just think! We can go back to the ranch!
So what did you do now? Hand over my money
or I'll break your neck!
Not a cent! Empty! Empty as all these bottles are!
This is what I deserve for trailing around with
a lowdown double-crossing snake.
I work out a foolproof plan for robbing a bank
and what have I got to show for it in the end?
That!
Huh! You ain't going to let a thing
like this worry you.
Your father was the most
famous horse thief in the West.
And he lived to be ninety-one.
Yeah, but my old Pa always knew
when it was the right moment to move.
Come to think about it...
- Old Pa had ideas...
- You know, this looks just like you.
Though to look at it, I'd never guess
that you were worth two thousand dollars.
Tchaikovsky.
I remember, sure I do!
But I... I remember everything!
Here's to you.
How about that awful night you got so
drunk and proposed to me?
- Yeah, I remember that.
- Yeah!
- Sure would've been disappointed.
- What do you mean?
I mean, for you.
Once more, you burned down the boarding house,
you behaved plumb low-shouldered, didn't you, honey?
Yeah, that's right, I sure did that.
But I was looking for you.
Now when I come down, I was so embarrassed,
I slapped you right in the face, didn't I, honey?
Might, I don't remember.
Listen. You going to stay here for good now?
No! No, I'm on my way to Louisiana.
Oh, first time I seen you in so many years
and you going all the way --
Tumbleweed. Yeah, got no roots.
Like tumbleweed.
Now listen to me. I don't think you ought to
leave for plenty of reasons, you know?
You need someone who'll care about you,
don't you see that?
- Stella?
- Yes?
Fortunately, I'm sober this time.
Drop dead!
Are you the fellow that
sells the tickets to Louisiana?
That's two hundred and ten dollars, single.
Pay in prior to your departure.
That's a pretty extravagant price.
All I've got's a hundred and eighty dollars.
No, that's won't be enough.
Am I mistaken, or do you have a little mule?
Yeah, Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Let's make it that hundred and eighty dollars
you have, plus little Jonathan. He ain't a horse.
No, but your ass is worth something, I guess.
I reckon maybe you're right.
Okay, a hundred and eighty dollars,
plus Jonathan.
One-eighty, plus Jonathan.
This token's your receipt.
Now step in here and I'll make out your
travel certificate, sir.
Thanks.
Now, don't forget to pack your long-john's.
You know, Louisiana can be
pretty damp in the winter.
Here we are. Come right in.
Oh, no, you don't!
My motto is: Be Prepared.
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, acting like this.
Profiteering out of helpless innocents
who believe your story.
Promising they can have a new life!
Well, where were they going to have it?
In heaven? Or in hell?
- What's going on?
- I want the sheriff!
- Who do you want?
- The sheriff! I want the sheriff!
Alright, Merchison?
Now I'll show you. Listen, sheriff. These varmints
are selling one-way trips to the bootheel.
They've taken my hundred and eighty dollars
and Jonathan.
Yeah! But I was prepared, alright!
It ain't easy to fool me.
- Sir.
- I see.
Merchison, this fine gentleman here...
... is disturbing the peace!
Lock him up for a couple of days.
If he tries to escape, shoot him.
He knows too much.
Sure, I get you, Mr. Burton. Mr. Burton, I get you.
I'll get even.
Wow! Does she come with the ticket?
Let's go in and ask.
Okay!
That's how we'll split the loot up.
Two parts for me, one for your gang.
- Parts to what?
- The job I told you about.
- What loot is it?
- Gold.
Gold. Gold!
Gold! Gold! Gold!
- Gold.
- I will accept. But how risky is it?
Oh, it's elementary work for a man like yourself.
As long as you don't forget this.
Once the stuff is in our hands, we have
to take special precautions...
... to make sure we don't leave
one single trace of evidence behind.
Claro, Señor Burton. No evidence.
You have my promise.
El Tigre doesn't make mistakes!
What is it, Merchison?
Well, I may be mistaken, Mr. Burton,
but I think I saw that blonde fellow there...
... and that black friend of his.
- What did you say?
- Who are these two?
It's those two varmints who interfered with
my plan to rob the bank at Bandera.
- Want me to kill these men?
- No! You have to keep out of sight.
- Now where are they?
- Over at Lowell's Place, the saloon.
That is, they went in there, but if they buy
tickets to Louisiana...
... I don't reckon they'll be coming out again.
Wonderful! New Orleans for only
two hundred and ten dollars!
Food and lodging included
in the price of the ticket.
An exciting future awaits you
in glorious Louisiana.
Hear that?
Hey! Anybody home?
Hey! You all gone to New Orleans?
Tchaikovsky.
Hey! Wake up in there!
Wake up! Come on!
Howdy, cowboy.
- You lonely?
- You offering something?
Yeah, my admiration.
Unlimited.
You're real tight with your cash, right?
Actually, I have to be. See, I took a lot of money
out of the bank a few days ago.
And my pal there, he borrowed it all.
He spent the whole lot on his Greek love.
- On a beautiful romance.
- Really?
- Tell us the whole story.
- Yes, tell us every bit!
Two tickets to Louisiana, please.
Certainly. That's four hundred and twenty dollars.
- Pay in prior to your departure.
- One moment, please.
... you mean, your mother's dead?
- There you are.
- What is this?
It is a paper that says me and my partner
will pay you within a month...
... not four hundred and twenty dollars.
We'll pay you five hundred and twenty dollars.
One hundred dollars interest.
Perhaps you think you're dealing
with a complete idiot.
I'd take it if I was you.
This is your receipt. If you'd like to step
in back, we'll arrange for your travel papers.
This way, please.
Don't forget to pack your long john's. You know,
Louisiana can be pretty damp in the winter.
Thanks for the advice, friend.
I was still in college.
They sent me the news. Ma had passed on.
Ah, what a tough break!
You've made me start crying.
Yoo-hoo! Bring us something to drink.
A bottle of whiskey, maybe, but only if you've
got the genuine article.
The bill's on for Tulip.
- Right in here, sir.
- After you. I insist.
Please sir, step inside.
You're our guest.
They're going to kill my sweetie pie.
I know what they're up to.
He was too smart for him!
Now they're going to kill him!
Hey, Trinity, what's wrong?
What took you so long?
Those men are robbers. And it's too bad
because Louisiana is supposed to be very pretty.
Much prettier, and there's two
thousand on my head.
Yeah, that's true.
This confidence game is finished!
I got an idea, Trinity. We got to plan
a job that's really big.
One that will make us both wealthy.
- Sartana, so long.
- Why? Where in hell are you going?
As far away as possible.
- From where?
- From you.
- Okay, buddy man.
- And just keep your hands off my horse this time.
I'll come back to get him.
I hope the two of you break a leg.
I may hunt them.
Talking to me?
You ever been to El Cerrito, amigo?
Why?
Because one very interesting thing
is happen right there in El Cerrito.
Ah, really? What was that?
Well, in El Cerrito, there was one gringo
blonde and they hunt him, very much like you.
- Who rob a horse.
- And can you guess whose horse it was?
No.
This is the most interesting part
of the whole story.
- Oh?
- Come to El Tigre.
- And just who the hell is El Tigre?
- Who is El Tigre?
I am!
I don't give a good goddamn.
Now you listen to me, you little
chunk of horse manure.
The very next time I meet you,
I'll have a story to tell with this gun.
- And you won't be able to --
- There will never, ever be a next time, gringo.
Drop your gun!
Let me go, you idiot!
Now, gringo. So you learn to know El Tigre.
He make on you his mark!
Like so!
No one dies here today
unless I or the Lord say so.
Put down your gunbelts quickly.
Who does he think he is, anyway?
Hey, amigo! This man here, you know who
he is, do you?
No, sir, I don't.
He's a cutthroat, a player, a filthy
stealer, a Goliath! A load of mierda!
But there's a law for horse thieves.
They hang them, El Tigre.
Now you are speaking, hombre! You are not like
him, that dirty son of a whore mongrel!
Men of that kind deserve to be shot!
You leave us alone and
the Virgin Morena will protect and help you out.
While we perform one act of justice, with delicacy
and discretion...
... and leave this horse thief's head
impaled on that spike.
That's a good idea.
Oh, boy, you're a dang fool.
It's about the craziest idea I can remember hearing.
What he's talking about are my testicles!
Well, well, well. Let's do it like this.
You fight like gentlemen
and you lose your place, alright?
Let's go to it, amigos!
Get up.
- Gringo!
- Caramba!
That was very well-done.
Why did you decide to come back?
Because you're worth the king's ransom.
And, man, you can't beat that.
You're worth two thousand dollars.
And two miles north of the pass here.
The Mexican cavalry will be arriving
from the southern bend.
- We've thought of everything.
- Are you sure?
Because you know Burton won't put
up with any mistakes.
There's no need to worry.
Once the gold shipment has been handed over...
... the rangers won't even be stopping
for a bite or a beer.
They've got other work to take care of.
I bet El Tigre could do it with his eyes closed.
Closed.
Don't forget it's a nice, fat cake and you,
my boy...
... can count on getting a fair-sized slice of
it for yourself.
Be seeing you tomorrow.
Good evening, folks. I hope we're not
interrupting anything.
A couple of honest men at last!
Listen, you want to shoot the sheriff, I'll
buy you a drink. A whole bottle each.
If you'll just put a bullet through him.
Excuse me, sheriff. Do you know this man?
- No.
- Don't you recognize his picture?
- Is it?
- Tell him who you are.
That one there.
Well, we have the prisoner,
and we have his confession.
All that remains is to collect
the two thousand dollars.
It's on the poster.
All in order, sheriff?
- Just a moment. I --
- Come on, sheriff.
- I've got two eyewitnesses.
- You said it.
Don't stand on ceremony.
And anyway, just think about what I have
in my hands and let's see the money.
Hey, listen, sonny. If you're a good
Christian, put a bullet through him.
Put a bullet through him!
The good Lord'll thank you for it.
Come on. Give the sheriff your gun.
Come on!
Between the balls in his eyes!
Them pretty eyes!
Now's your chance!
Well, sheriff, I think it's all legal.
Thank you all very much.
Please, sir.
- And now I have to go.
- Hey, young fellow, you're leaving like that?
You're not letting me go?
Escape, that is a prisoner's duty.
Hey! You mean you ain't even going to
shoot him, just to spite him?
- Adios!
- You lice-ridden son of a --
Bitch!
Are you praying?
What a funny way to pray!
Why?
Way out here, without a church.
Without a preacher, without even speaking.
But ther is the sun.
The sun is everything.
You see it rise in the morning.
And you never know if you will see it set.
That's our destiny.
Where are the others?
Over there.
Let's go.
Look.
Look what's happened to us.
We were attacked, by Mexican bandits.
They didn't leave anything.
I reckon Burton was behind it.
What difference does it make?
When we left Cleveland, I was still a little girl.
No men don't quite understand what happens
to little girls when they grow up.
What does that mean?
I don't understand.
Well, when boys grow up, they become men.
But that only means they get taller.
But with women, it's different.
Sure, they get taller, but that's not all.
They kind of grow out in all directions.
You, for example, you sure have grown
out in all the right places.
And you really think so?
I really think so.
Martha!
Where are you, Martha?
I have to go.
Will we meet again?
I really don't know.
I hope so.
Really. Bye.
Hey, listen. Take this.
But I can't take this.
Sure, you can. Go on.
I don't need it, and neither does my partner.
You know how it is in business.
The money comes, the money goes.
Dammit all, Trinity. Why don't you go to hell?
Do you realize they cost us five hundred
dollars each, those bottles?
And why's that?
Because you feel like making google
eyes at that little smidgen of a girl, that's why!
- But she --
- But she, but she!
Those girls are all alike, I say.
They're polite to you if you're twenty, they'll
go to a barn dance when you reach thirty...
They'll pretend to love you if you're forty,
give you real loving when you're fifty...
Then get married to an old geezer of seventy.
Figure it out for yourself what they're going
to think of a bastard with two thousand dollars.
It's time you started to grow up, Trinity.
Anyway, I hope you filled your canteen, at least.
I'm not that absent-minded, Sartana.
Well, that's something, I guess.
Let's go, come on.
Where are we going, anyhow?
To meet the local stagecoach.
Why? Do you know anyone on it?
Brother, you just don't understand.
I mean, we're going to stop it.
And borrow a little cash.
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
What don't you like?
I don't like the idea of robbing that stagecoach.
Why not?
Because.
'Cause I never tried it,
and I don't want to begin now.
Boy, you're something.
Yeah, I'm a sailor.
And how you managed to stand
all that water, boy, that's something, too.
You don't have to drink it, you know.
Yeah, sure. But if you fall in, you get water in
your ears, eyes, up your nose, everywhere.
Come on, let's take a closer look.
We could always pretend to be guides
and get them to hire us.
I still don't like it.
You've already made that clear.
Robbing stagecoaches ain't for us. That's for
bandits with no sense of imagination.
I don't understand you at all, Trinity. Don't
you ever want to see your damn island again?
Even if there is a fair chance that the folks
there won't ever let you back in.
Persevering is the only chance you got.
- Well?
- Okay.
But for safety's sake,
I'll hold onto the kitty, alright?
Right.
Captain, there are two men riding up.
Those fellows sure are mean-looking.
I wonder if they're bandits.
Worse, they're rangers. We can't turn back now.
Howdy. The bar open?
Sure, it's all yours.
Thank you.
We will leave our horses here.
Bill...
Looks as if there may be a storm brewing.
We can't afford to risk any delay.
So tell the men to get ready to move.
We're leaving in ten minutes, okay?
Alright, men. Let's get going.
- Real thirsty, huh?
- Yeah, you said it!
The trouble was, we missed the last water hole.
And forty miles of desert dust is no joke.
My lungs... Yankee bullet left in there.
When I drink water, it makes me cough.
I suppose you got to keep off liquor, eh?
Don't even talk about that.
Where are you two from?
Oh, that is... Yes, well...
From New Orleans.
New Orleans, eh?
Yeah, we had a time getting here. It's a long
story, and not a tall one either.
So you traveled all the way from the
Delta to Texas?
Are you gold prospectors?
What? Oh, yeah, yeah! You've hit it.
That's just what we've been doing.
Searching round for a goldmine.
Well, I don't think you're likely
to find any gold around this area.
At least, I never heard of anyone finding any.
Anyway, the best of luck.
Mount up, men.
Captain, hold on.
Can me and him go along with you?
I mean, just until we come to some village.
You see we're both a bit scared of bandits here.
After all, a couple more guns
could be useful to you.
No, we're rangers. And we're on duty.
No one can accompany us, or even ride next
to the wagon.
We have orders to shoot on sight.
You got away with it because of one thing.
The well.
But just see you stay far away from that wagon.
Are we ready, Bill?
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.
Forward!
How about that?
Ten rangers out of uniform,
to escort one creaky wagon.
Funny. It's mighty strange.
And it was a strange business about that map.
Yeah? What was that?
There. When we arrived.
The captain was looking at a map, exactly like
the one in the sheriff's office in Quintana.
Why do you keep asking my opinion?
You said stagecoach hold-ups
were your specialty, didn't you?
In the first place, the wagon tracks were
almost six inches deep.
Now, there were only two men
inside and two on top.
Which means it was carrying
a mighty heavy load, don't it?
Sure. It could've been guns or ammunition.
I mean, what else would rangers be escorting?
Gold!
I think I've got it!
I can smell it in the air!
I can feel it in my bones!
You're getting so you see gold everywhere.
You're sick, man.
I know what this means! El Capitán!
Take off your pants, you pigs!
Quickly!
El Tigre.
This one is not of the capitán!
I'll find another!
Stop wasting time!
Strip your clothes and get dressed!
- In you go.
- Go on, get in there.
Go on! Go on!
- I am an officer.
- An officer, are you? Bueno, this is an officer.
- Hurry up!
- Get moving!
Hey, hombre, the uniforms!
Here is the jacket, El Tigre.
That feels good.
My hat.
My hat!
I want the capitán's hat!
No smoking on duty.
Stop doing that now!
- Not bad.
- What?
I said 'not bad'.
The way you handle everything.
And in that uniform, you could fool your own mother.
Yeah, just don't forget that you got to go on doing
things exactly the same way, El Tigre, you hear?
- Bring it in for all the fellows.
- Sí, Tigre.
No, not Tigre, you don't say 'El Tigre'
to your capitán!
If you call me El Tigre again, I'll kill you!
I know.
I am your capitán, understand?
- Yes, sir, Capitán.
- Bueno.
Don't you worry, Señor Burton.
I assure you it will all be perfect.
Oh, I'm not worried.
What do you... what do you think we pull in?
I know precisely.
You see, every two months, by contract, our
government has to send these cases to Mexico.
And they contain two million pesos.
What, pesos? In gold?
Naturally, what else?
The gold comes from Mexico City and inguts
and is sent to Washington...
... where our mint makes it into your official peso.
They hand over the cash at this outpost right here
in La Peruca.
The detachment of cavalry you just overpowered
were waiting here as usual.
They were going to escort the gold to Mexico City,
but not now!
We're all prepared to receive
the rangers, Señor Burton.
And the gold.
That especially.
There's nothing to worry about.
The only way for anyone to reach La Peluca
is by going through Crazy Dog Canyon.
My men are waiting there.
They're all set.
We've got nothing left to do now. We can just
sit on our backsides and wait for the rangers.
And the gold, naturally.
But don't let the men get too drunk.
Capitán, I done what you said.
Capitán, I've done what you said.
Capitán!
My name is El...
El Capitán.
Will one mule be enough?
Yes, sure.
New pesos always weigh
at least a tenth of an ounce.
So two million pesos would weigh quite a lot.
Only we're not getting all the gold.
I like that.
Like what?
When you say the word 'gold', your eyes shine.
Don't yours?
Sure. It's better to have
plenty of pesos to spend...
... than a woman.
But before you spend your money,
you have to earn it, right?
You heard Burton. You got to make sure nobody
can get through Dead Dog Canyon before he arrives.
I'd like to see the guy who could
get through that canyon now.
I've got it staked out with my best men.
You'd better be right, Clyde.
- Boss --
- What are you doing here?
Did anybody say you could leave your place, Red?
I did!
Drop your guns, nice and easy.
That's the idea.
Well! Who do we find? It's a pretty small world.
And it's becoming more infested each day.
With vermin.
Cozy place you got here.
Ma'am, I guess you're in charge.
Mind if I have a little of this tea?
You son of a bitch!
Hold it.
This fellow was slipping, so I gave him a hand.
We'll be moving along. Don't worry.
But I'd like to know why a high-class
woman like yourself here...
... is in with these bad boys.
Cat got your tongue, ma'am?
On your feet.
Over here, stand together.
That's right.
Oh, I got it. I reckon you're one
of those deaf-mutes, eh?
Bastard.
It's a pleasure. Sartana.
And that fellow's Trinity.
Well then, there now. I'm the cashier, remember?
That was our agreement, wasn't it?
Yeah, that's true.
Good boy.
As I was just saying, my pal and I are only
trying to be friendly.
We just wonder what brought you all here.
Burton will fix you for butting in on this.
He'll get you two even if he
has to follow you to hell.
Sartana, the lady's right.
She can't speak in front of witnesses.
Yeah, I guess not.
There we are.
There are no witnesses to bother you anymore.
Anything you want to say or do
will be our little secret.
Anything, honey.
How dare you speak like that!
And as for you, you're as bad as he is.
I hope I never have to run into either of you
unless I got a Winchester trained on you.
They kiss at twenty years old, they dance
when you're thirty years old...
They make love when you're forty years old,
and they marry --
Maybe I was wrong, but I didn't have to
throw away all my money to learn that, did I?
- Soon.
- Soon what?
They will be arriving.
Who?
- The rangers.
- Ah, sí, the rangers.
Go to the tower there. Keep a watch out.
And don't fail me.
You are the only one I can trust.
Sí, mi capitán!
Pedro, here are the soldiers!
Wake up! Wake up!
Guards!
- Get ready!
- What is it?
El Tigre!
Don't call me El Tigre, you fools!
I am your capitán!
- Everybody!
- All to your places!
All to your places! All to your places!
- Remember, you are soldiers!
- Go to your places!
- Everybody!
- To your places!
Go to your places! Go to your places!
What places?
- Hold it!
- Your places!
Holding a barrel of mierda, you idiot!
Caramba! If you are not ready, I kill you!
In your places, muchachos!
- Quickly!
- I have to open, no?
Don't open until I tell you!
I wonder what's holding them up.
Welcome to La Peluca, amigo. You're tired, yes?
What terrible weather for this time of year, no?
Por Dios, it seems to be playing funny tricks on us.
All that remains from past is
our own flesh and our own vitality.
No, you will accept a bit of tequila, no?
- Yes.
- Who are you?
El Tigre... El Capitano. Who are you?
I'm Captain Alex McCorney.
Of the Texas Rangers.
Ah, McCorney!
Six months ago when I came here,
there was another captain.
Captain Vergara.
Isn't he still in charge here?
El Capitán Alonso Vergara...
... went kapoom!
That dirty traitor!
I wish I could have him here
in my hands to wring his neck!
- McCorney.
- That's strange.
I thought he was one of the best commanders
in the whole Mexican army.
Thought he cleaned out the whole area around here.
Politics.
- The shipment?
- All yours, Captain.
Pedro!
- Pull all the boxes.
- Señor, okay.
Unload the wagons! Hurry!
Hurry!
Here a handful of screaming eagles, gringos!
Quickly! The gringos need to leave!
Oh, yes!
Rangers, help!
Is there anybody else who needs help now?
So long, Captain.
Sure.
Thank you.
Pretty horse.
Fellows, forward!
Hold it!
No, no, you jackass soldiers! El Tigre!
I'd like to stop the smoking,
and give up drinking.
I hear this funny kind of noise in my ears.
It reminds me of a player piano.
It is a player piano.
- Well, if it ain't my pal!
- Howdy, there.
- Where'd you spring from?
- You ought to know.
In fact, I really shouldn't speak to you.
Nope. It ain't charitable to leave a man
in the hands of Sheriff Merchison.
Well, I don't keep grudges. Forget about it.
Just don't do it again.
How did you manage to escape, sir?
Well, the sheriff got shook real bad.
Food poisoning, so I did what I could.
He was suffering.
Right here in his throat.
So I massaged it.
This is a man who's a good Christian. You probably
thought you'd never get to know one, did you?
Well, you're damn lucky.
There ain't many of us around.
But I like you, boys.
- And I got an idea.
- So long.
So long, friend.
Hey! Where you off to?
Hey! Ain't you two interested
in ten chests full of gold?
Did we hear you right just now?
You did say gold?
That's right, ten chests.
You mean to split the money, man?
Yeah, that's it.
Three ways.
Okay. You're on.
Good. Some partners...
Now, I was in that jail cell waiting for them
to kill me and...
Cut the double talk. Get to the point.
Patience.
You see, I could hear when they was talking
and I heard Burton...
... and that crazy friend of his giving
instructions to El Tigre...
... the Mexican bandit, you see.
Now El Tigre's men were to overcome the
soldiers at La Peluca.
And accept the gold consignment from the rangers.
Pretending to be the actual Mexican escorts.
Now you fellows saw that map on the desk
at the sheriff's office.
Well, they were going over the plans
for the robbery at Peluca.
You are a genius, you know that?
That's what I tell myself, and no one
else ever thinks so! Now they sure will!
Adios, old-timer.
Where you going?
Hey, wait for me!
Hold on! How am I going
to team up with this dirty robe?
Dammit!
- Give her the gun.
- Okay.
Hi, there.
You know the way better than anyone, Tigre,
but I still think I'm right.
We'd better get away from here fast.
Those mavericks are dangerous.
They could make trouble for us --
A couple of thieves are not able to frighten me!
El Tigre! Traveling at night can be dangerous.
The mountain can be dangerous as well!
We may lose many men, and even some of the gold!
- Tomorrow in the morning.
- Tomorrow, then.
First thing in the morning, Tigre.
But don't forget what I said.
I don't want your men touching any more
liquor. From now on, they keep sober!
What? My men drink alcohol?
Never! They do not touch a drop
when they are on duty!
For me?
Can I trouble you for a light, compañero?
Your turn.
Who are you?
Sartana!
Let's get him!
Look out! Take cover!
At least we got one. I suppose we really
ought to be happy for that.
You call that gold?
Hell, all those crates look alike.
I don't think there is any gold.
Well, I feel sure.
Don't forget. I saw Burton and that
woman of his.
How many men are there?
Oh, about thirty.
About thirty?
And what will we do with thirty? Serenade them?
Not a bad idea.
What do you call this noise?
You call this noise? This is Mexican music!
Pedro, tell the men we leave in ten minutes.
- Sí, El --
- El Tigre!
Señor Burton, you agree my share of the gold
is fifty percent.
That's right. Split it down the middle.
That's more than we agreed to.
My offer was two parts for me.
And one for you.
No. We split in the middle.
- You know what that's called?
- Extortion.
It's those two mavericks who attacked us
at Dead Dog Canyon.
Well?
Alright.
It's split in the middle.
But get them out of the way, 'cause
that's what you're being paid to do!
More entertainment...
Three potatoes.
Come on.
Up here!
You filthy son-of-bitch! Tell me who you
are and I will humilliate you!
Sartana!
Surrender. Surrender, you cowards!
Surrender!
You want them to kill me?
Very good.
That's the idea!
Don't be afraid.
My, my. Aren't you a well-trained bunch?
It must be the military life.
Now, all stand together in a nice, little line.
No more tricks.
I'm interested in one thing only.
Gold.
For us, the gold and you boys are free to leave
here whenever you please.
You heard what he said.
Get them the gold!
You heard the man.
Sartana, that's the last.
Hey, amigo! You leave us one small case, yes?
To permit us a 'copita' to your
health and honor, no?
- No.
- No?
This one here, more or less?
Surrounded, men! Don't anyone move!
You're all covered!
Close the gates!
Glad to see you again.
I am Colonel Alonso Vergara.
You have saved two million gold pesos, amigo.
You deserve a reward from both our governments.
Indeed, you do.
I'm certain that Ramón Gonsalvo Miguel Rivera
Calderón Iliás will know how to recompense you.
Who are they?
Who are who?
All of them. All those you mentioned.
But he is only one.
The governor of the Mexican provinces.
And what are his ideas on recompensing?
You will be presented with the Cross of the
Knights of the Order of Saint Epiphany.
He can put that where he wants to.
- What?
- That is, on my chest, right here.
Near the heart.
Five thousand bucks.
Five thousand dollars.
Even if it were five hundred thousand,
or a million, lying around saying 'take me'...
Five thousand would be enough for me.
To get me back to my island of Trinidad.
That's okay for you.
But you don't know what it is to come from
a long line of reputable outlaws.
You can't escape the gold fever,
if it's in your blood.
A gambling man on a winning streak can leave
the table a lot easier...
... than a man born an outlaw can resist
the sight of gold, the touch of gold.
The smell of gold!
When I was a boy, my daddy told me
a story I'll never forget.
And he could spin a yarn especially
by the time he'd drunk his third.
- Third glass, eh?
- Third bottle.
Well, this story's about a fellow called
Aladdin who...
... discovered a wonderful hole in the ground,
filled right up with gold.
What's over that there border?
Mexico.
And over there?
The United States of America.
How did it all begin?
Two countries explored, claimed and populated
and now they're calling themselves nations...
... all on account of the power of one thing.
Gold.
My father used to talk to me when he was alive.
He said the only thing he was looking for...
... was something no one ever looks for.
What was it?
I've never understood that.
But it must be something that is very beautiful.
Trinity...
Figured on sleeping?
No.
I was just thinking.
Sorry about it. That's something you can't afford
to do, buddy...
... when your pockets are empty
and your belly is rumbling.
Come on, we got to move.
Over here, honey!
- Hey, sexy.
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Come here!
How about it, princess? How about coming
back with a few more drinks, eh?
Here you are, fellows.
Rot gut.
Bring us something better!
I wonder if we were intruding.
What do you think?
- Only one drink now.
- I'm sticking to my promise.
Two whiskeys.
Whiskey?
I'm afraid there's no whiskey, fellows.
Only tequila.
Alright, anything will do as long
as it wets the throat.
Why don't you try gargling
with a bottle of ink?
I got an idea they're trying to be rude to you.
But there are three.
You mean to say you can't handle them?
Get moving, Trinity. They're ready.
Hey! I'm talking to you, darky.
Supposing you turn around.
Satisfied?
Yeah, but you took your time about it.
I get slow when I'm thirsty.
Hey, no. Don't ever touch that!
You keep your goddamn canteen.
I was just going to fill it with some of this.
I'm sorry, but it's personal.
Ah, come on.
God knows, that's my luck.
Our price is still a thousand.
Can I count on you?
Twenty-eight murders, ninety-six robberies...
... and that's just the last couple years' score,
because my memory ain't always up to scratch.
Proud record, I'd say.
But these are tough customers.
You won't be the first person
to try and get rid of them.
Clyde went up there and when he tried to
kill them, they made a fool of El Tigre...
... against odds of thirty to two.
Just what do you think you
could do that others couldn't?
Well, maybe you ain't heard yet.
Last week, somebody finally outdo Billy Murdock,
the famous sheriff of Kansas City.
Yeah, who?
Who is my oldest youngster?
That child is so modest, you know.
He even gave the credit to his brothers.
What do you say, Burton?
Nobody will give you a lower price than I do.
Better not lose your chance.
Okay, alright. Maybe you're
a match for them all.
I'll pay you want you want, Mrs. Baker.
- I'll pay you that two thousand.
- Each one, that is.
- What do you mean?
- Four thousand because there's two of them.
Is there anything else?
Payment, naturally, to be
Obviously payment will be made in advance.
That's the way I always pay everybody!
You'll have to inform me
as soon as these two fellows --
Well, of course, I'll let you know!
It's in my own interest!
You've made a very wise decision,
Mr. Burton. Good day.
I could be wrong, but that there
ain't no whipperwill.
It's either him or his ghost.
Where the devil have you been?
You dropped plumb out of sight,
without even saying goodbye.
A fine partner you are!
Deserting your pals when trouble starts.
I thought you said you were
a God-fearing Christian.
Of course, in principal.
When Buck Ben Bolt runs into the law...
... Buck Ben Bolt starts running away.
Who is Buck Ben Bolt?
Who is he? Buck Ben Bolt is me, fellow.
Now that I've explained everything
to you, I'll get on my way.
Something's the matter, don't you think?
Well, he has a dog, a nice new suit on...
A new wagon, two mules...
And that cigar cost half a dollar.
- And I say it stinks!
- Yeah, you're right. I agree with you.
Smells high. Almost the way
he's going to be smelling...
... when the jackals and vultures
are picking over his vitals.
Hold on a minute there, youngster.
You boys are too impulsive.
I got another rule for you.
Keep your bullets for special emergencies.
Put that confounded pistol away, God darn you!
- Give one-third to you.
- A third of what?
Well, when it's too late to tell any more lies,
you might as well fess up.
Yep. I stole one of them cases of gold.
Yes sirree.
In the confusion, I just happened to find
it in my hands. Just kind of sticking to them.
Well, a man can let go of a beautiful girl,
if he really must...
... as I well know...
... but a case of gold, never!
I always knew we could count on you!
I think it's fabulous!
No. Sometimes a fellow can be lucky is all.
You live your life between the Rio Grande
and El Paso...
... you can survive where everybody does
his thinking with a pistol in his hand.
Well, what are you?
You're a genius.
You're a con man!
Nope, just an old fool who knows
how to divide by three.
Slop!
Howdy, dear heart!
Well, look who's here.
- Take a seat.
- You get more handsome every time I see you.
Yeah, you get fatter.
But ain't you afraid to come back to this
town after all the trouble you caused last time?
When a fellow's got gold in his pocket,
he ain't afraid of no one.
May I come in, sir?
- Yoo-hoo! The slop's in!
- Come on in.
Ready to live in the open air, spread out
my bedroll under the moon.
You just prefer their company to mine, that's all.
You're mistaken, dear.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
They're young, adventurous. Same way I was
when I was young, a long time ago.
The dream of youth.
You take the dreams away from
a man, you don't leave much.
You're in a trap here. Burton's decided to
get rid of those two fellows, you see?
And you're going to go with them, too.
Don't you understand that, dear?
He may get rid of them.
Then again, maybe not.
Tchaikovsky.
What's taking the old lady so long to get here?
Are you certain the
message has reached her, Clyde?
Yes, yes, of course. Told her so myself.
Then I wish she'd hurry.
Mr. Burton's waiting.
Well, here I am, according
to our agreement, Mr. Burton.
And here is the four thousand dollars
in advance, Mrs. Bicker.
Oh, but, it's six, Burton.
What for?
- You've agreed to pay two thousand a head --
- That's right. And there's two of them, in there!
Look, my babies are here.
I gave birth to three hooligans and I assure you,
they're longing to work.
I understand.
There's the other two thousand.
Thank you.
And now, tell them to get to work,
and make it snappy, Mrs. Bicker --
Come on, boys. Go to work.
All the women, outside!
They keep us busy.
Seems to be everybody, don't it?
That's right. Everybody's here now.
But in a minute, we're going
to have a couple of corpses.
Let's clear out.
I'll fix you, Sartana!
As for you and your idiot --
Excuse me, please.
Now don't you lads be late for dinner tonight.
Yes, Ma!
Stand up.
Stand up!
Sit down.
Lie down.
Let's have some music.
That's for the two thousand dollars.
One, two, three.
Four, five.
Six...
Eight, nine.
Ten!
Oh! How do you do?
Break it up!
You idiot!
I'll show you critters!
I got him!
A present from Jonathan, you coyote!
My little sister! What have I done?
What are you doing in there?
You brute!
Why, Mr. Burton! Did you know it was I?
You bet I did!
Time to go! Bill!
Where's Bill?
Bill!
Here I am!
Come on, it's late.
- Someone hit you?
- Yeah.
One for you, too.
Trinity!
Your next move!
Come on, let's go.
You know something, old pal?
I'm even thirstier than I was before.
You think maybe there's another
saloon around these here parts?
Hold it.
Raise your hands!
You ain't going anywhere.
You're staying in Quintana.
We'll make you comfy-like,
over at our local cemetery.
They let us down!
It's my scene!
But it's the end of the picture!
My water bottle.
It held five pounds of explosives.
I left it with the top unscrewed, and it worked.
Hi, fellows!
Adios, partner!
Well, hold on, fellows! It's old idiot!
