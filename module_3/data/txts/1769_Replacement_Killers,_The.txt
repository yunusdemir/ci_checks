<i>Delta Team, Delta Team.</i>
<i>He's about 50 meters away.</i>
<i>Can you see him?</i>
<i>Roger. Copy that.</i>
<i>He's headed your way.</i>
<i>He's headed your way.</i>
<i>He's on the move so let's</i>
<i>all be on standby. Roger.</i>
All right, let's roll.
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Everybody hold back out there, hold back.
Let him run. He ain't going anywhere.
Back away! Back away!
Get it out of here! Go on, get it out! Go!
They're gone. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Put that gun down.
Put it down.
Don't make me.
Could be considered inappropriate for a murderer
to appear at his victim's burial, detective.
Just here to pay my respects.
Respect?
For the blood of my child?
My orphaned grandson?
Your son made his choice.
And you made your choice,
detective.
The day you chose to pursue
a vendetta against me.
Against my family.
Detective, your position offers more
opportunity for arrogance than safety.
Don't open it. Mr. Wei needs
to see you personally
My son is dead.
My condolences.
A child is irreplaceable.
Which brings us to your task.
It involves a cop.
That's why we want an outsider.
After that,
your obligation to me ends.
Dad, come on.
I went against Mr. Wei today.
There will be consequences.
What do you want me to do?
I'm worried about my mother and sister
I would like to you take them
from Shanghai to someplace safe.
Here is some money.
Help me send it to them.
John...
...we are talking about Terence Wei.
Safe has a very limited meaning.
There's been a problem.
Why ain't this car done? Huh?
I gotta get this thing on the boat tomorrow.
Nobody leaves until this car is done,
you hear me? Alright?
And get rid of the VIN numbers.
I don't wanna get caught for that shit again.
All right, all right, you guys get
back to work. It's for me.
And how the hell do you guys get phones?
I don't pay you enough for that shit.
Yeh, what do you want?
Eddie, it's John.
Hey. What happened? The piece wasn't
where I left it? I put it there myself.
It was there.
I need a passport, can you help me?
Yeah, I'll just call Bob Bruin.
No problem.
No! He works for Mr. Wei.
Everybody works for Wei.
What do you want?
<i>I want someone who doesn't.</i>
I know this broad.
I try not to use her too much because she's
a pain in the ass. You know what I mean?
- Her name's Meg Coburn.
- Meg Coburn?
<i>Yeh, she's in the Olive Building, ya know?</i>
- I'll hook you up in the morning. Where you gonna be?
- It's better if you don't know.
All right, Johnny boy.
Watch your back, huh?
Yeah?
Meg Coburn?
Never heard of her.
Eddie.
Eddie sent me.
Great.
Alright, well just hang on a second.
All right, come on in.
Can I help you?
I need a package.
- What's a package?
- Papers, you know?
I don't know. I'm slow that way.
You'll need to be specific.
I want forged documents to China.
Okay. You said "forged."
We'll do it.
Now have a seat.
Or not.
- I don't have much time.
- As you will.
China? Mainland?
All right. You're gonna need a visa,
a birth certificate, a driver's license...
...and a passport.
Now, to make coming and going easier...
...we make you an American citizen.
So what you need is gonna cost you.
No problem.
The only way money isn't a problem
is if I see it upfront.
Because, ya know, I don't like hassling with
assholes, you know what I'm saying?
How soon did you say
you needed this?
From here I go to the airport.
One hour.
That soon?
All right, back up.
You have to back up because I'm taking
your picture. It won't come out.
Smile and say,
"Flight from prosecution."
Okay. What's your name?
John.
And?
John Lee.
Thank you.
You sure you want John Lee, cause aren't
there like a billion John Lees in China?
Yeah, all right. John Lee it is.
I can fix that.
Yeah?
Meg Coburn?
Never heard of her.
This way!
All right, hold it right there!
He's still out there.
He won't get to China.
We shouldn't be chasing
our problems, Mr. Kogan.
We should be solving them.
How would you like this handled?
Bring in professionals.
Men of John's talent.
- Coffee, no sugar okay?
- Nope, no sugar.
And, a ham sandwich would be better.
I mean, I've been sitting here
for 12 fucking hours.
All right. Let's see what...
...Meg Coburn's all about, shall we?
Ahh... swindle, bad checks, mail fraud,
no heavy felonies here.
Still, what you lack in weight you make up for
in volume. 12 arrests before your sweet 16th.
It's a little unusual for a girl of that age
to be in so much trouble, don't you think?
Well, I've always considered myself
a feminist pioneer.
Well, you've been clean here for about four
and a half years. That's a good thing.
You either got smart
or you've been very...
...very lucky.
- Is there a third choice?
It doesn't matter.
Your good luck ran out today.
So, now let's talk about your office
and four dead bodies.
I'll bite. Where did they come from?
You didn't kill them, did you?
Detective. You really think a lightweight
like me did all that damage?
- Who's that?
- Looks like a ghost.
Oh, come on Meg. You can
do better than that.
It was in your computer.
You're a bright girl in a bad place.
- I can help you.
- Yeah.
Well, you see detective, I can't seem
to remember one single bad place...
...a cop ever helped me out of.
Is that so? Well...
...somebody had to help your ass out when
you were 14. Custodial placement.
But you don't remember that, do you?
Fuck you.
- You don't know a goddamn thing about me.
- I know everything about you.
It's all here in black and white.
Go on. Read it.
It's your life.
Nobody screwed it up but yourself.
- Hey, you're looking at two years, baby.
- Minimum.
Oh, you're not as smart as you think you
are, are you? Cause if you were, you
wouldn't be messing around with Terence Wei.
- Terence Wei?
- That's right, Terence Wei.
Where the hell do you think all those
dead bodies in your office came from?
I have never dealt with
Terence Wei in my life.
Well, you have now, okay?
Okay, this is the part where I get to
talk to the court appointed attorney.
You're not under arrest, Meg.
Which means, you have no right
to an attorney.
That also also means I can
walk out the fucking door.
Sure, you go right ahead, but I tell you what...
...there's somebody on the other side
that wants you dead.
- I'm real scared. Do you see me shaking?
- I sure as hell do.
I've got a deal for you.
You tell me everything you know about that guy.
I can make this all go away.
Put you under police protection.
You know what? I honestly don't know anything...
...but even if I did,
I wouldn't give it to you.
Suit yourself.
Last chance to arrest me,
Detective Zedkov.
I didn't think so.
Oh, by the way, tell whoever
you're gonna put on my tail...
...that I'm gonna lose them
on 6th Street.
Put Morris and Duke on her ass.
- Why don't we just charge her, man?
- She's red meat.
I'll put her on a hook,
see what the dogs do.
Shit!
Ah, Jesus Christ!
What the hell are you doing here?
I still need papers.
Yeah, great.
How do you expect me to cook a passport?
With crayons and construction paper?
I mean, take a look around you.
Anything that didn't get shot full of
holes, the cops confiscated.
My $3000 computer
is now a paperweight.
And, you know, four years of work are down the
drain because you picked my door to walk through.
- We'll go to Eddie.
- What for?
For help.
You must be kidding! I'm not going anywhere
with you. Like a walking goddamn bull's-eye.
So are you. You're safer with me.
Is it my perfume, or something?
Cause you're the second guy today to assume that
I need, want, or will accept help. I won't.
It's not an option.
What happens when I tell you
to go fuck yourself?
Okay.
If that's how you wanna play it.
But when the gun's in my hand, we're
going to have this conversation again.
Okay, come on Nick.
What do you got for me, huh?
How about it?
- My kid works faster than this.
- I'm trying. There's just not much there.
Okay, I think I got it.
There's your ghost.
Good stuff Nick! Come on.
Hey!
Next time kidnap someone
with a Bentley.
So. How'd you piss off Terence Wei?
Cops told me.
- What did you say?
- I didn't say nothing.
What, you think I'm an idiot?
I know you got me mixed up in
some Chinatown gangster bullshit.
Less I know, better.
Buckle up.
Eddie?
Let's go.
Eddie?
Oh, shit.
Eddie.
You two make a cute couple.
You're welcome to try.
Take his gun.
Check them.
I beat my head against the wall
trying to anticipate your next move.
Actually, I beat Eddie's head
against the wall...
...trying to anticipate
your next move.
Mr. Wei will be pleased
we've found you.
Okay.
Obviously this situation has
nothing to do with me.
So I'm just going to walk out that door
and pretend I never saw anything.
I'm sorry, Meg, but you're in
a little too deep.
- You picked the wrong partner.
- Partner?
No, no, no, wait.
I'm his hostage.
I just met this guy yesterday.
He told me his name was John Lee.
His name is John Lee.
And you know what happens to hostages.
They tend to get killed.
Cuff him.
Cuff them both.
Shit!
How's that leg?
How's yours?
Bring the car around.
Flush him out!
Oh, fuck!
I wondered if you
were coming back.
- Get down!
- Oh, shit!
Get in!
Keys! Take the keys!
Give me your gun!
Get the car moving!
Come on!
Move the car! Go!
Put the gun down!
Oh, shit!
Another problem, Mr. Kogan.
- John was lucky. It won't last.
- Don't confuse luck with skill.
I served with John's father in China.
He was an honorable man.
But he could be ruthless.
John is like him.
- Where are John's replacements?
- Arriving as we speak.
It's gonna hurt.
Just do it.
I told you we would have
this conversation again.
You son of a bitch.
And what the fuck did you get me
into with Terence Wei?
He's my patron.
Patron?
He made it possible
for me to come here.
What, does he sponsor you
to play the violin?
In exchange for...
...services.
What a nice way of saying
you kill people.
Did you think you could
fuck Terence Wei?
Did you think you could
fuck Terence Wei?!
And now his foot soldiers are
all over the streets looking for you.
And for me.
Put your gun down.
Now would you let me walk
out that door?
I didn't think so.
You're not leaving me with a whole
hell of a lot of options now, are you?
Do it.
Do it.
Shoot me! Do it! Do it!
Do it right now! I'll do it for you.
I'm sorry.
Then tell me what the fuck
is going on!
Our situation in China is difficult.
I was born a soldier.
I've seen people die.
All I ever wanted...
...was for my family to be safe.
I would do anything
to protect them.
Anything.
Mr. Wei used my mother
and sister...
...to persuade me to do three jobs.
The first two were criminals.
It wasn't difficult.
And the third?
I couldn't do it.
If I don't get back to China...
...my family will die.
You picked a very bad day
to grow such a selective conscience.
But they chose me.
<i>Hello?</i>
It's me. What about my family?
<i>I can't find them.</i>
<i>Wei's people also sniff out.</i>
I need passport.
<i>You can use mine.</i>
Thanks.
What was that all about?
I have a passport.
Fix it for me.
Then you can go.
My family is running out of time.
I'll need a picture.
This time it's two jobs.
But it's the two of you.
John is more trouble
than we thought.
So, what's the time frame?
Immediate.
So I'm just curious...
...what made you assume
I could jack a car?
Lucky guess.
Your mother or your father?
<i>Mechanics Illustrated.</i>
My father taught me how to shoot.
Playing catch is so impersonal.
He was a general.
A very important man.
Was?
What happened?
He was re-educated
in the cultural revolution.
What does that mean?
Anyone who disagreed with
Chairman Mao was made loyal.
Families were punished.
Many were beaten,
tortured, shamed.
And how did a general
get re-educated?
By his son.
When I got older...
...I promised...
...I would get my mother
and sister out of China.
What do you mean,
that's all you got, fool?
Give me the money.
Get the fuck out of here!
What's up, Meg?
- Damn! You look good!
- Not today, Loco.
Hey! What's with the attitude, girl?
See, you need to spend time with me.
Get some of this love.
Meet my new friend.
What's up, "friend"?
Ain't no harm.
No harm, right?
Old boyfriend?
I stick to my own species.
Here we are.
Fastest passport photos in town.
Now, give me three bucks.
Hostage etiquette.
Kidnappers pay for incidentals.
Thank you very much.
You gave me four.
I'll take it as a tip.
Sit still and stare
straight ahead.
You could have saved yourself
trouble by doing that third job.
It was wrong.
Mr. Wei was taking revenge.
A man named Zedkov
killed his son.
Zedkov?
Jesus Christ! You're getting
yourself killed for a cop?
Not a cop.
His son.
What?
A seven-year-old boy.
Why?
That is how Mr. Wei deals
with his enemies.
Through the families.
Alright, John. You're done.
Get out of there.
Picture's not done yet.
We'll have to wait
a few minutes.
Don't turn around.
Cops?
No.
Assassins.
Stay close to me, okay?
Now!
Let's go!
John!
Hello?
Hey, champ.
How you doing?
Dad!
- What are you up to?
<i>- Making a shake.</i>
Listen to this.
<i>Stevie, let me talk to your...</i>
Two officers down in a shootout.
Gotta move now.
Stevie! Stevie!
Stop it, would you?
Daddy's gotta go work now.
Are you canceling tonight?
<i>I wouldn't.</i>
<i>- You promised we'd go to the movies.</i>
<i>- We are.</i>
<i>I'm gonna take you to see</i>
<i>the cartoon...</i>
That kid turns that blender on
one more time...
...l'm gonna shoot him myself.
Then I would have to kill you.
Wei specifically wants the kid's brains
dumped in Daddy's lap, my friend.
Alan.
Alan!
Alan!
I moved your family to Canton.
But I told Wei's men they'll be in Shanghai.
How long do I have?
Wei will find them by tomorrow night.
Go get them first.
I'm sorry, Alan.
How will you get to the airport
with those two killers after you?
They won't be.
They're here to finish my job.
Zedkov's boy must die in his arms.
Then he will share Mr. Wei's pain.
Zedkov's son for your family. Wow.
It's a hell of a choice.
People die.
Children die.
People die.
Children die.
The same thing happens to your
family if you don't get there first.
When I was a kid, my mom
was kind of a weak woman.
She couldn't make her own money,
so we always had boyfriends...
...in and out of the house.
The one that stuck was Lester.
He used to beat on her.
And when I would stand up for her...
...he would belt me in the mouth.
So...
...I learned to shut up.
Then I hit 14...
...and I was passing for 21
in all the local bars.
And, ah, old Lester started getting
real friendly with me.
So that was it.
I was out of there, clean. Only I, ah...
...left a 10-year-old brother behind.
Named Joseph.
I... I... I thought he would be okay,
you know, cause um...
...he was a boy, and ah...
...and I didn't think Lester
would touch him.
And, ah, one night Lester just...
...put Joey's head
through the kitchen wall.
People die.
Children die.
I've spent whole days
thinking about that one thing.
That one good deed that'll wipe
out all the shit that I've done.
You ever feel like that?
So, you didn't want to shoot a kid.
Welcome to the human race.
Standing aside is no different
from pulling the trigger, John.
Here.
Now that's some of my best work.
Have a nice trip.
I'll need guns.
What the fuck?!
- You picked the wrong place.
- Oh, yeah?
Why don't we see if the jury
will stand up for a rat?
What's the story, Loco?
Tell me something. Should I dump on him?
No, no, no.
No, don't trip.
- I got it all under control.
- That's good.
Now get up. Get up!
Keep the dice warm.
Righteous, these are my people.
Now I know what you're thinking
and it ain't even like that.
The honest truth, it's a warrant with
every drug dealer in town.
Now if I've been seen with you
and I did make that call,
shit, I'd be causing myself unnecessary drama.
We wouldn't want that now, would we?
Alright, break out the munitions.
That .45's all I got.
You sure about that?
I forgot about that one. You know what,
you can have that. That's on me.
Give us your keys.
Say what? No, no, no, no.
Now you're tripping.
You stand by your product, Loc?
You're gonna bust me a cap
right here?
Damn! Can you make that a little louder, Loc?
I told you, there ain't nothing in there.
You got both my straps.
Thank for the ride.
How am I supposed to get home?
You've seen our car. Just twist the
red wire and the yellow wire together.
The time and the place.
The boy is at the beginning
of his life.

Zedkov, get your kid down!
Go!
Hold on! Hold on, Stevie!
We'll be okay!
Zedkov. Get your boy out of here!
I'll cover you.
Okay, okay!
Go!
Run! Run!
It's my boy.
They went after my kid.
Listen to me. We're gonna
lock down this goddamn city.
It's not them.
Coburn and her pal saved my
ass in there tonight.
What?
They saved my son.
Come here, boy.
- How you doing? You still scared?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Come on.
You sit here in the car.
Come here.
- Guess what?
- What?
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- Hey!
- You got the keys?
Have them take Stevie home to his mother's.
Put them both under guard.
Pick somebody good. I want to make
sure they're safe until this is over.
Do you want us to tell her what's going on?
- Tell her what ever you want to tell her.
- What are you doing, Ze?
John?
Call Zedkov.
He knows now.
You'll be safe.
Safe?
What about you?
My family is not protected.
So, what are you gonna do?
Kill all of Chinatown
just to get to Wei?
I cannot run from battle.
From what I am.
There's a difference between
battle and suicide.
It would be
the last death I cause.
Fair enough.
Okay, John. Let's go.
You saved the boy.
This is not your fight.
I know.
Just somewhere along the way I developed
a problem with watching you die.
I have the same problem with you.
I believe he'll come here next.
So will Zedkov.
I don't think we should wait
for either one of them.
Of course not.
Call the airport,
then our men in Shanghai.
We will handle his mother and sister
personally before John gets to them.
And me?
Stay here.
Earn what you were paid for.
Hey, hey, hey!
Meg.
Meg, I'm gonna find you.
But you could save me time...
...and put a bullet in your head.
If the position were reversed...
...l'd do the same for you.
Are you?
Excuse me?
Gonna put a bullet in your head
now that our positions are reversed?
Meg, it doesn't...
I didn't think so.
Checkmate.
The boy will die, John...
...as well as your family.
Not in your lifetime.
John?
Zedkov! Zedkov!
What's going on, man?
They're gone.
INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS
Hey.
Hi.
I brought you a
going-away present.
For your family.
Thank you.
You know, I've never made a passport before
for someone I didn't want to see leave.
This was a lot easier when
they were shooting at us, huh?
I will miss you.
