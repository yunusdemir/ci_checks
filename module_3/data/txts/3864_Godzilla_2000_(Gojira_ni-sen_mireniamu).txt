Godzilla, king of the monsters,
again wreaked havoc on
the streets of Tokyo.
The entire city was transformed
into a sea of fire.
And in the middle of the
postwar economic miracle,
Tokyo was once again the scene
of death and mass destruction.
The advent of nuclear power had
brought the monster back to life.
Mankind was powerless and could only stand
and watch as Godzilla vented its rage.
A few months after the attack,
Tokyo undertook a massive
program of reconstruction.
Japan moved its capital to Osaka,
and the country slowly started
to return to normality.
Just 12 years after Godzilla's attack,
the monster returned.
This time, it attacked Japan's
first nuclear power plant.
The Prime Minister is here!
It's confirmed.
The decision has come through.
Japan is giving up
nuclear power plants?
That's correct.
Godzilla had been
attacking the country
to feed off the radioactivity created
by the nuclear power plants.
The government therefore decided to
close the plants as a safety measure.
However,
steadily growing demand for electricity
meant the government had to act quickly.
Water, coal, wind and solar energies
were used to fill the void left by
the de-commissioned power plants.
But all these alternatives combined
could not replace nuclear energy.
And so...
a decision was taken at
the government level to
establish the Bureau of
Science and Technology.
The aim of this institute was to
develop sources of clean energy.
It was based in the
new capital, Osaka.
As you all know,
the aim of this institute
has been to conduct research into
new sources of clean energy.
Today, this research has finally
given its first results.
Consequently, we're proud
to announce a new era,
an era of totally clean energy.
The plasma-powered energy system!
In the months that followed,
plasma-derived power became
the standard energy source.
However...
There's one thing you
must remember, men.
We're here to do a difficult
job, and do it right, okay?
The whole country is
counting on your success.
All right then! Let's do it!
Okay?
Yes, sir!
- Tujimori?
- Sir!
All details present
and correct, sir!
Let's go!
Thirty years after attacking the
power plant at Tokai Village,
Godzilla has
reappeared in Osaka.
Don't forget what I told you!
It may be big, but it's still just a lizard!
Aim at its legs to bring it down!
Come on!
- Target approaching!
- Tujimori, take the warehouse!
Roger!
You, this way!
The rest of you, follow me.
Come on!
Take positions, hurry!
On my command!
Hold it.
Ready, fire!
Pull back!
All units attack from the rear!
Fire!
Godzilla approaching,
point 42 east, pull back.
Come on, let's go!
Come on! Hurry!
Cover, Takei!
Yes, sir. Fire at will, men!
- Ready to fire?
- Ready!
Fire!
Tujimori, move in now!
Right, sir!
Takei, pull out!
Yes, sir!
Takei! You read me?
Come on!
We gotta outflank it! Hurry!
- Ready to fire?
- Ready!
Fire!
- Pull back!
- Hurry!
Oishi!
It's heading for the
clean energy factory!
Get out of here!
Tujimori! Let's go!
Not yet, sir! Let me
fire one last round!
No way! Come on!
I'm staying!
It's an order! Now move!
G ANNIHILATION STRATEGY
All right, I'll do it again.
Are you all paying attention?
- Come on, dear.
- Yes, Mom.
You take the rice
and curry powder,
then add some pickles,
and wait five seconds.
Curry on rice!
That's weird!
The bowl is really
a microwave oven.
Hey, hey, wait.
The micro-bots mix the ingredients,
and the microwave cooks the mixture.
Right?
It's a trick, told you.
- That sucks.
- Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Let's go to the park.
What did you have to
go and do that for?
Now I've lost credibility
with those kids.
Don't you think it's about time
they learned the truth anyway?
Still, I have to admire you.
Magic or no magic,
These are remarkable achievements
for a self-taught engineer.
You have a lot to be proud of.
You had no right to
give the game away.
What are you guys
doing here anyway?
You might say we're headhunting.
Hey, this place is the pits.
What is it anyway?
It used to be a warehouse,
now it's our HQ.
Oh, right.
Afternoon, miss!
Ever since Godzilla reduced Osaka
to a heap of rubble in '96,
the government has been collecting
data on the monster's characteristics.
Four years ago,
it created an anti-Godzilla command
unit within the self-defense forces.
But there's one thing I
don't quite understand.
I thought Godzilla was attracted
by a radioactive leak.
And if there are no more leaks,
then there's no more Godzilla.
You're right. In theory,
we have nothing to fear.
However, that's only in theory.
The one way to be certain...
would be to eliminate
Godzilla once and for all.
Four, three, two, one.
Activate satellite support unit.
Section 1's job is to
search for Godzilla.
Section 2 studies the monster's
organism and its behavior.
Section 3 over there handles statistics
and logistics in case of evacuation.
Search, study, statistics...
You're really taking
the threat seriously.
Move positioning
monitor from D1 to M3.
Number 7 satellite-monitoring
system, check.
And this is the command center for
our combat troops, the G-Graspers.
This is Hosono, our pilot.
This is Nikura,
our information officer.
Hello there.
Our radio operator, Mr. Mima.
He used to serve in
the submarine corps.
Here's Okamura. He was a captain
in the rangers, like me.
And my name is Kiriko Tujimori.
Major. I'm in charge.
Kudo!
Miss Yoshizawa!
You really helped me during
my graduate school days.
I took your physics
classes back then.
A small world.
D12 section team,
please come to Conference Room 3.
So you've been working
in Akihabara?
Yeah. I guess you could say
I'm sort of self-employed.
And if I asked you to join us,
what would you say?
I'd say that I have no wish
to die young, thank you.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
It must have been hard.
I can't change what
happened to my friends.
However, I can make sure that such
things will never ever happen again.
And how will you do that?
With a new plasma weapon
we're developing.
A miniaturized black hole.
Black hole?
Black hole, right.
It'll swallow Godzilla and
keep it prisoner for eternity.
As you know, a black hole swallows
everything, including light waves.
Whatever is sucked inside will
remain there for all eternity.
Godzilla is no exception
to that rule.
We'll need your help with this.
This is really far-out.
The world's first manmade black hole.
Incredible!
And miniaturized!
I'd never have believed it!
Right now, we're still
at the research stage.
According to preliminary figures,
we must reduce it to two meters.
Enough to launch it from a satellite.
Attack Godzilla from space?
What a great idea!
But we must be careful not
to damage the planet.
If everything goes as planned,
we'll fire the black hole
into Godzilla from orbit.
Right now the black hole's too big,
so we're counting on you.
You won't be disappointed, I promise.
Yes?
Red alert! I repeat, red alert!
Godzilla?
A rise in temperature in the Japan trench.
It's hard to say.
What's the depth?
Twenty meters.
If it's Godzilla, it's the first time in
years it's been so close to the surface.
What do you think? Is this it?
Too early to say.
The temperature's decreasing.
I'll send out a reconnaissance team.
You'd better hurry
with that new weapon.
Yes.
Hi there!
Good morning, kids.
Are you all early birds?
It's Yama-chan from Kids Kingdom!
Are you done with your
summer break homework?
Yes! I collected insects for research!
Terrific!
You'll have to come home early, Jun!
We're not done with our move.
I just have to return this
insect cabinet to Wataru!
- Switch off the engine, please!
- What's going on?
I'm afraid this is a restricted area.
It's off-limits, sir.
I've got to drop something
off at the village.
This area has been sealed.
I can't let you go any further.
I'm sorry, sir.
{\an8}Shirasu Elementary
School Shirasu Vineyard
- Open the barrier!
- Sir!
Go ahead!
Data transmission circuit
installation complete. Activate.
Team position, check.
I think that's fixed it.
Try the backup circuits.
When you first told me about your plan,
I found it hard to believe.
But now it's becoming
a reality at last.
Just remember.
it's plasma energy that made this possible.
Let's hope it works.
Also,
once we've destroyed Godzilla,
we have to make sure no
trace of it remains.
We mustn't make the same mistake.
Right.
That's it. All the circuits are armed!
We're ready!
When you're ready, Major.
Stand by. Test firing.
Test firing.
Mima here. Stand by.
Protection, everyone!
Monitors 1 to 20, all check.
All right,
everybody to firing positions!
Hurry up! Clear the area!
Code accepted. Locking on.
Confirm pulse sensor.
Go ahead. You'll go down in history.
Code Alpha, test firing complete!
Oh, my God! What is that?
A Wormhole. A space-time distortion.
Amazing. So they really exist?
- All units, stand down.
- I think it's gonna work.
It was a huge success.
How did you get in here, kid?
This whole area is off-limits.
Recovery unit, report to Section 3.
What's going on?
This kid was in the forest.
He must've seen the firing.
Right, thanks.
Hey, tell me something.
Can you keep a secret?
Like what?
Well, like not telling anyone
about what you saw just now.
Not anyone? Not Mom or Dad?
Say. Are you a G-Grasper?
Yes, I am.
But you're a woman, so how
come you're fighting Godzilla?
Aren't you scared?
What about our secret?
Can you keep it?
Good. So long, Mr. Insect.
"Do not touch"
"Jun"
I think I'm going to like Tokyo.
The next time your
father gets a transfer,
I think he's going to
have to go alone. Right?
There's no garbage collection today!
You can bring your garbage
down tomorrow, okay?
Special Tracking Force,
proceed to the
conference room at 1600.
Working out, huh?
What a waste of time.
Why's that?
Because the professor and I
are developing a new tool
that will make Godzilla
disappear into a black hole.
Here, I brought you this.
It's a standard ammo round,
but it contains a special
micro-transmitter.
If you happen to be in danger,
then you just fire it.
As soon as the
bullet's been fired,
the transmitter activates.
I can lock on to the signal and
come quickly to your rescue.
You better build up your body first.
"Mivagawa"?
Boyfriend?
He was our platoon commander.
Godzilla killed him.
That was back in 1996, in Osaka.
She recovered his dog tag...
and promised herself that she'd continue
the fight he'd led against Godzilla.
Can I test it?
Sure.
Installation complete.
- Safety zone checking confirmed.
- Activate number three circuit.
Are you sure that's going
to fit on a satellite?
The problems of payload and
ballistics have been solved.
Godzilla has nowhere to hide.
We'll be able to attack Godzilla at
any point on the planet from space.
It needed a genius to think of it.
Congratulations.
The satellite has already been set up.
Man, I'm dead beat!
Hey, don't flake out on me now.
Come on, I'll pay you overtime.
You know, why is it always me, huh?
Look, there's another one of
those leaks right under there.
This is really weird.
It is going to be a mess,
but maybe we should dig it up.
- You are right.
- Do you agree?
Do we have to dig the
entire Shibuya area?
- It is impossible.
- But that's our job, you know.
No, it's not.
Hey, cut that out, will you?
You know I hate that!
- Hey, do you want a drink?
- Yeah.
- A beer okay?
- That'll do.
- Wait for me over there.
- Okay.
- I'll go to the store.
- Thanks.
Yuji! I got your beer here.
Where are you?
Look. it really isn't your fault.
Now, don't worry.
Yeah. But if I hadn't
taken the egg with me...
No, we're the ones to blame.
It was because of the
plasma experiment.
An insect must have been in the way,
I guess, and it mutated.
Remember you asked me why a woman
would want to fight Godzilla?
A friend once said,
"When you're afraid of something,
then you don't run, you fight it."
The person who said that,
he was my commanding officer.
He died in a fight with Godzilla.
I'm just carrying on
where he left off.
Am I making any sense?
Look, this is a Meganulon.
It grows into a Meganula.
And last night,
I saw one flying over the city.
- Stand by for satellite link upload.
- Quickly. Look at this.
We're getting another reading
from the G-satellite.
- The Pacific?
- Radiation level plus 36.
We've been analyzing
the light rays emitted.
The spectrum's unusual.
Like nothing we've seen.
Could it be Godzilla?
And radioactivity,
have you checked it?
I'm calculating.
Try to zoom in on it.
I'll put it on the screen.
Satellite upload
completed successfully.
Zooming in.
More.
Analyzing target area.
Again.
Target analysis completed.
It's Godzilla!
Just look at the heat it's generating.
Yeah, but what is that?
It's Meganula.
Radioactivity confirmed!
It's Godzilla!
We will go into action.
This is Griffon. Ready for takeoff.
Roger. Stand by, Griffon.
Griffon ready for takeoff.
All engineers will now clear the area.
Griffon, take off!
Look. Return to vertical flight.
Roger!
Jeez! What a stench!
Underwater mic is down.
Activate.
Yes, Tujimori.
We have a signal!
Godzilla?
It's very close!
Right underneath.
Take him up!
Major!
Major!
You mustn't fire,
the Major's down there!
What the hell is she doing?
She's too close!
Get down lower!
Divert its attention!
Okay, I'll try.
Are you all right, Major?
I managed to plant a
transmitter on Godzilla.
Drop an SGS receiver.
Yes, ma'am!
Goddamn lizard.
You won't get away this time!
- Good.
- I'll have the other figures tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, professor.
Is Dimension Tide okay, professor?
Next stop, Tanegashima Island.
That giant dragonfly you discovered,
I can now confirm is a Meganula.
The Meganula dragonfly existed here
on Earth about 350 million years ago,
in the early Carboniferous period.
The larval stage is called Meganulon.
It develops in the water,
and then sprouts wings
to become a Meganula.
What's the matter?
The Meganula usually
lives in large swarms.
What's more, it's aggressive.
Extremely.
Haven't you been watching
the news bulletin?
We're right above the Shibuya
district of Tokyo at the moment,
 and as you can see,
the whole area is under water.
The flooding seems to have been the
result of a violent rise of the water table,
although experts still have
no idea of the exact cause.
Rescue units are being rushed
to Tokyo from all over Japan,
but the whole area is in total chaos,
with people trying to flee the city,
causing huge traffic
snarl-ups everywhere.
- There have been no reports...
- Major, we must check this out.
Could this be of any help?
It's a miniature SGS.
Not just a mini-SGS, but it also
has an infrared camera, too.
Move along. No pushing.
Don't panic!
This Way!
Take it easy, please.
Take it easy.
Okay, move back.
Okay, let's go!
Please evacuate!
All right, now go deeper.
Roger.
What is that?
They look like eggs!
Connect to G3, start transmission.
Point B2 to B6,
checking commenced.
There's a message from the transmitter.
It seems it found something.
27 degrees, 30 minutes north,
143 degrees east.
That should put it somewhere
off Chichi Island.
All right, let's have a look.
Spectro sensor on.
Scanning power to maximum.
SGS data downloading.
There it is.
Don't let it out of your sight.
Okay!
Our reports show that Godzilla
is heading due north,
and is now in this area.
In order to launch an attack using our
latest weapon, code-named Dimension Tide,
we have to wait until
Godzilla is on dry land.
We can't guarantee that the
weapon will work through water.
Therefore, we will have to wait until
Godzilla makes landfall somewhere.
This is likely to be Kiganjima Island.
Kiganjima is a small
uninhabited island.
It's about two miles across.
Once Godzilla lands there,
Dimension Tide will wipe it out.
Well, it all sounds very wonderful.
However, this gun...
Are you sure it'll be 100%
effective against Godzilla?
That's right.
What guarantees are you giving us?
What happens if your
toy causes a disaster?
It won't happen, I promise.
If we don't use the weapon,
our children will live forever in fear!
Please, gentlemen,
our future rests on your decision.
All units, open connecting circuits.
All right. What have you got there?
Another invention?
Just a new program I put
together in my spare time.
I'll show you.
Another Kudo Technologies creation.
It checks operating systems 10
times faster than other programs.
All right, nurse, off you go and see
what you can come up with, okay?
Mr. Sugiura.
I hear you told the
government we were ready.
But we haven't done any
full-scale tests yet.
The weapon just isn't ready.
We need time.
Machines need fine-tuning
before they're operational.
You ought to have known that!
I can't believe this.
Look, I'm sorry.
I've complete faith in
your team's capabilities.
Thank you, Major.
I only hope that your
faith isn't misplaced.
Come on, Kudo.
Hey, slow down!
Alpha base to Alpha 1,
begin operation as soon
as you see the target.
Alpha 1 locking onto target.
Charges away.
Photon gun firing!
Godzilla is approaching the island.
I'll try to drive it towards point B.
Alpha wing withdrawing.
Returning to base.
Request permission to use D.T..
This is Unit 3. We're on the
north side of the square.
We're going to try
to destroy the eggs.
Roger!
Sergeant!
Fire!
Godzilla will be landing soon.
Dimension Tide, stand by.
Okay.
Dimension Tide engaging standby mode.
Ready?
Operational mode, engage.
300 seconds to launch.
Countdown underway.
Godzilla is coming ashore.
What?
Dragonflies!
Code emergency!
We're being attacked
by giant dragonflies!
Millions of Meganula!
Meganula?
System ready. Awaiting fire command.
Ready to fire.
What shall I do?
Hit the button and
let's fry that lizard!
Obstacles in aiming system.
Cannot lock on.
The dragonflies are
blocking our sensors.
Awaiting input for firing sequence.
Try it anyway.
Forget about those damn dragonflies!
The dragonflies are
swarming over Godzilla.
They must realize it's
an energy source.
Some of the Meganula have been killed.
Opening fire, keep your distance.
Roger.
Locked on to target.
Dimension Tide, fire one!
Firing complete.
Cooling mode activated.
We missed it. Godzilla's intact.
Do you read?
Hurry up! Fire again!
It takes an hour to cool down.
We can't fire before then.
Oh, shit!
Yes, sir. I expect Godzilla
to head towards Tokyo.
Its target will be the National
Chemistry Institute in Shibuya.
Are you quite sure, sir?
I thought the project
had been shut down.
Yes, sir. In fact, I personally
signed the orders for the closure.
No! In fact, measures are being
taken for your protection, sir.
Yes. You can count on me,
I promise you. I...
What are you talking about?
It wasn't my fault!
It was! You're responsible.
I told you the equipment wasn't ready,
but you wouldn't listen!
What are you doing?
All of us want to defeat Godzilla,
so let's not fight.
The equipment needed fine-tuning,
and that's now done.
It'll work next time round.
Forgive me.
I want the SGS to start a search.
I want every inch from Kiganjima Island
to Tokyo city covered on a straight line.
Do you think that Godzilla's
heading for Tokyo?
Well, it's quite possible.
And if Godzilla is headed that way,
we have to be prepared for the worst.
Check out every sector.
Here, I brought you a new one.
- Oh, thanks a lot.
- And don't forget, it's line 417.
Right.
Unit 2, Unit 2,
what's your position? Over.
I don't get it.
Normally these units aren't fragile.
I don't understand how
it broke so easily.
We've had a number of instruments
go haywire recently.
Yeah, not to mention the radio.
Wait a minute.
What if there was something magnetic under
the water causing all these problems?
What the hell's that?
HQ! Do you copy?
A monster! A second one!
Cover your ears!
Look out!
You can't stay here! Get moving!
Better not move around.
You have a fractured arm there.
You're lucky it wasn't worse.
That would suit you fine, huh?
That thing was absolutely huge.
It was the king of the Meganulas.
Yes. It's called Megaguirus.
Megaguirus?
Yes, a specimen that is chosen among
the Meganula, like a queen bee.
Some years ago, I believe, a fossil
was found somewhere in eastern China.
Megaguirus is a formidable fighter,
attacking enemies of whatever
size to expand its territory.
The species remained almost
invincible for several million years.
Major, the SGS has spotted Godzilla.
You better remain here.
Godzilla approaching.
Orange alert.
- Satellite imaging.
- Where is it?
Four miles off Hachijo.
Sugiura was right.
It's heading straight for Tokyo!
According to the latest
defense agency reports,
Godzilla may be heading
towards the Tokyo area.
Satellite surveillance systems have located
Godzilla off Japan's Pacific coast,
and it is expected to reach
landfall sometime this afternoon.
Of course, here in Tokyo, the people are fleeing,
taking with them what they can carry...
You've got to leave. Come on!
Excuse me, sir, when is
Godzilla expected to land?
In about five hours.
We don't know exactly
where it'll land yet.
We'll let you know.
But that's no good,
people are panicking.
It's true an
evacuation's underway.
However, speculation would only
make things worse. Thank you.
But, sir! One second.
What about the...
Where on Earth is your father?
I can never get him on his cell phone!
Hurry, dear!
Hurry up!
Evacuations of Minatoku and
Shinagawaku are now complete.
Tell me, why is it heading for Tokyo?
In 1966, it attacked Tokai...
because it was attracted
by the radiation there.
I can understand that.
And again in 1996, it was Osaka
because of the plasma energy.
But today, we don't have any
energy production in Tokyo.
Major, Godzilla is approaching Odaiba.
{\an8}Red alert! Level 3! Level 3!
Let's scramble!
Griffon, scramble!
Once Godzilla does make landfall,
try to contain it in the port area,
protect the city center.
Roger.
Godzilla is in Tokyo Bay.
It's now moving from
point 208 to point 304.
Godzilla is surfacing.
He's at 50, 40, 30, 20, 10.
He's coming up.
Look, Godzilla's surfacing!
Photon guns, fire one!
Yes.
There's a good lizard.
Come here.
What's that?
Megaguirus is attacking Godzilla!
Megaguirus?
Dimension Tide, stand by.
We must try to kill both of
those monsters with one shot.
- Dimension Tide in standby mode.
- Okay.
It's okay.
- Satellite support unit cannot deploy.
- What happened?
What's the matter?
- Now what?
- D.T.'s in trouble.
D system has crashed.
I can't seem to control it.
What's wrong with it?
I know what.
Megaguirus' high frequency.
That's what's causing
all the problems.
Our control system,
it's gone dead.
We're trying to fix it.
It's no good, backup's gone.
Just one minute, let me see.
Ready for crash landing?
There's no backup file.
What's going on here?
It must've been the high frequency!
It messed up our system!
Damn it!
What are we waiting for?
- Let me try!
- Hey, come back here!
Kudo!
You're going to have to give
us something pretty quick.
Give me a minute, will you?
Kudo! Aren't you injured?
I'm fine,
I didn't even know you cared.
I care more about Dimension Tide.
What is the problem?
Think you can fix it?
I'm gonna have to.
I don't really have any choice.
All right, let's see
what the problem is.
No response from the
Light Tracking System.
Monitor the satellite connection.
Use 30% A.L. filter.
Dimension Tide is controlled by
my original operating system.
I think I've got something.
Your move, Kiriko babe.
Kiriko! The Major?
Telemetry alert!
It can't be!
D.T. is changing its orbit.
Orbit decreasing rapidly!
Damn! I think we're too late.
I'll try and adjust it.
We're totally helpless.
A chopper. I'm going out there myself.
Sir!
- Prepare a chopper!
- Keep trying!
- Mr. Sugiura.
- What?
Tell me something.
What are you hiding from us?
We all deserve an answer.
Godzilla's heading for Shibuya.
Roger.
That's it.
Major, we can't use the photon gun,
but we're airworthy.
Prepare for takeoff.
- Activate sub-control system.
- Damn it! There's no more fuel!
The orbit's not holding.
It's going to fall!
The Science Institute!
What is Godzilla doing there?
What does Godzilla want
in the Science Institute?
It wants plasma energy.
Plasma? But they dropped the plan,
didn't they?
In case it attracted
Godzilla back again.
The development of plasma energy...
will bring tremendous wealth
to our country in the future.
And also guarantee
you a high position.
I cannot deny that.
But every country must have
its secret research projects.
We did shut down the generator.
I don't get it.
How did it know the lab existed?
But it came all the same.
All because of your gross stupidity.
Do you realize just how
many people have died?
Don't you lecture me, Major!
I organized the G-Grasper section.
And look what a mess
they made of everything.
Kiriko, take it easy!
Bastard!
You sent hundreds to their deaths!
- Yes?
- Hi, Kudo here.
Thought you might
like to listen to this.
300 seconds to firing.
Continuing countdown.
You managed to fix it?
Yeah.
But it's still falling out of orbit.
We'd better hurry.
D.T.'s starting to enter
the atmosphere!
Auto sensing system,
partial failure.
Damn it! We won't be able
to lock on to target!
Are you sure about that?
Is the operating system still active?
It's still active.
If we manage to lock on,
then we can still fire D.T.!
All right then, let's try it.
What are you going to do?
Lock on to me, it'll be easier.
I'll try to get above Godzilla,
then you fire.
You're out of your mind.
It's too dangerous!
It's what I'm trained for.
Major!
It's my show.
Countdown continuing.
All right, give me the co-ordinates.
354-13946820.
Be careful. Only 150 seconds.
You better get a move on.
Roger, that ought to be enough.
In position.
I got her!
We're locked on. We made it!
Listen, Major, you be careful.
D.T. is starting to melt down!
Just 60 seconds to go now, Major!
- Roger.
- Temperature overload.
Are you ready? Here we go.
- Let's do it.
- Activate radar tracking system.
Please let me fire D.T.
Her life is at stake here,
don't forget.
Dimension Tide...
Fire!
Firing!
Kudo here! Do you read?
Answer me!
Why do you want to
talk to me so badly?
You got a crush on me or something?
What happened to Godzilla?
It's gone.
I think we've finally won.
No sign of activity, all clear.
Godzilla destroyed.
Operation successful.
Yeah! We did it!
And although plasma energy officially
should have been discontinued,
it seems a small research plant continued
to function at the Science Institute.
The project was known only to a
select few within the government,
and was supervised in
person by the chief of the
anti-Godzilla unit attached
to the defense agency.
He will be one of the chief witnesses
at the upcoming parliament inquiry.
We've received a report,
seismic activity.
What if Godzilla had
somehow managed to
escape from the black
hole we sent him into?
You think it's due to Godzilla?
We'd like you to help us with it.
Not a chance!
I've had just about enough
of lizards for now. Sorry.
Right, I see. You mean you're chicken?
No, don't worry. I was only joking.
After all, who could replace
the marvelous Kudo?
Careful, we're talking
about a broken arm here.
Oh, sorry.
Slow down, no running!
I'll take these back first.
We'll wait for you at
the gate, all right?
- Hurry up.
- Okay.
