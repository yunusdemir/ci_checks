Ohhh, good Black.
Yeah. Want a bite?
Thank you very much, sir.
- Purpose of your visit?
- We have come for our horse.
This horse?
Yes. His real name is Shetan.
- I doubt he's for sale.
- We have not come to buy him.
He was stolen from us.
<i>Shoof! Voyons.</i>
- Kurr...
- We must act tonight.
Shetan, we meet again.
Mom?
Shetan.
- What is it, Alec?
- Something's wrong with the Black.
Black?
What happened? Is he all right?
I think so.
What's the matter? You're not
getting enough attention, huh?
- Oh, this horse, Alec...
- Why don't you go back to bed, OK?
Oh, no. You're not sleeping in the barn,
Alec. Sorry. You know the rules.
Come to bed now, Alec.
Shh... It's OK.
I'll be right back.
Mom! Fire!
Black!
Alec! Get out of there, Alec, right now!
Operator! Operator!
Alec, get out of there! Alec Ramsey!
Give me the fire department!
Hyah!
- Alec, are you all right? What happened?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- I'm gonna try and save my car.
- You be careful.
Try the other side.
Come on.
Easy, boy.
Son, get back. Please get back.
- Alec! Get away from there.
- Is anyone in that barn?
No. Oh, our beautiful barn!
- What happened?
- I don't know what happened.
The horse got away,
then it burst into flames.
- How'd it start?
- The paint cans.
- We were painting the barn.
- Are you all right?
I'm OK. And Alec is all right.
He got the horse out.
Hey, stop! Stop!
Hey! Wait! No!
Whoa, Black. Whoa, Black.
Easy, boy. Easy.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Hyah!
Shetan!
Come on, Black. Come on.
Come on, Black!
Black.
I am Abu Jakub Ben Ishak.
Shetan is our horse.
We are taking him back to Wadi Draa.
But you can't take him! He's mine!
No! No!
No! No!
I am sorry, child,
but the horse must come with me.
The monster that started the fire
will stop at nothing to prevent
Shetan from coming home.
<i>- But this ís his home!
- His home is in the desert with us.</i>
No! You can't take him! No!
No!
<i>Black!</i>
Black!
<i>Black!</i>
Black!
<i>- Alec, can you hear me?
- Yeah, Mom. I'm fine.</i>
Don't worry about me, OK?
<i>What do you mean?
Of course I'm worríed.</i>
<i>Alec? Alec?</i>
Hey, Mom. I know where the Black
is going. I'm going after him.
<i>Goíng after hím? What do you mean?</i>
<i>Alec, come back here. Alec!</i>
Here it is. Wadi Draa.
Hm. Way out there
in the desert like that, huh?
The closest city is Casablanca.
Casablanca.
Pan American has a clipper ship
which flies twice a week from LaGuardia.
Today and Friday at five.
- And it gets there in three days.
- Thank you.
Where's your kid stationed now?
- He's in Frankfurt.
- Frankfurt, huh?
Hey, kid! Hey!
Hey, you don't belong out there.
You ain't allowed on that scaffolding.
Get back in the ship.
No, no, no. In the ship!
Where you belong
with the rest of the tour.
That's right. Inside, inside.
- This plane is going to Casablanca, right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Each engine is accessible.
- You can go inside?
- That's right.
An engineer can enter the wing
from the flight deck
if emergency repairs are necessary.
But in six years, it's never been needed.
If you'd like to move forward.
<i>Yeah, I get it.
I'll be back up for the other case.</i>
I can replace the whole door,
but I think just a nut'll do it.
<i>OK.</i>
Hey! Get out of there!
How long have you been in there?
I don't know. I got in in New York.
- How'd you get in there?
- I just climbed in.
- Are you going to eat that piece of bread?
- What?
Cos if you're not, I'd like to have it.
Sure.
A stowaway. Hm.
<i>If you were mine, I would make
your bottom very sore, mon petít.</i>
Be sure you don't leave these walls. You
are going back on the clipper tomorrow.
Hey, are there any horses around here?
A horse. Horses.
<i>Ouí.</i>
<i>- Ah. Un cheval?
- Ouí, ouí. Un cheval.</i>
<i>- Magnífíque, non?
- Ouí, ouí.</i>
<i>C'est le cheval du colonel.</i>
<i>Ouí. My cheval - more big,
more magnífíque. Black.</i>
<i>- Black?
- Ouí. Black. Uh... the Black.</i>
Black?
- Shetan.
- Shetan?
<i>C'est bon. Tuareg.</i>
<i>Shetan?</i>
- No, no.
- No?
I know you, from photographs
in American newspapers.
You won the Big Match Race.
Come, look who we have here.
- I've been hoping of news of Shetan.
- He was kidnapped.
- Yes, I know. By Sahid Ben Ishak.
- Do you know him?
<i>Never mind what I know.
What do you know?</i>
What is this?
This is the symbol of the Uruk, simply
the most powerful tribe in the desert.
How did Ben Ishak and Shetan
leave America?
<i>On a ship called the Casablanca.</i>
Ah, yes. I shall catch him in Sahli.
We must leave immediately.
Who are you after? Black?
I am after victory. Power!
Power to the Uruk
for the first time in history.
Start the motor.
You have been very helpful.
Hey! I scratched your back,
now you scratch mine.
- What does this mean?
- Where is Sahli?
An oasis in the desert.
The only way to Wadi Draa.
Ben Ishak must stop there for water.
And now I must depart.
<i>- Please take me with you.
- Peace be with you. Allez.</i>
Wait! Look!
- Where you got this?
- Why? You want it?
- I must have it, yes.
- Then take me with you.
- A deal?
- Right.
<i>Allez.</i>
I see you make great progress.
I will finish.
Trucks are the future, you know.
Roads across the mountains... great...
<i>Imbécíle!</i>
Great highways crisscrossing the desert.
You want the desert to look like that?
I want progress. Change!
Change in the tribal leadership.
Soon you will learn
the old ways of the Berbers.
The ridiculous traditions.
Ask an honourable man to be his guest,
no man would refuse. How stupid!
Ask a man for protection, no harm
will come to you. What nonsense!
I will destroy those traditions
once and for all.
<i>Aíde-moí.</i>
<i>What's so funny?</i>
The medallion.
- But we're not in Sahli yet.
- Give it to me!
I drive.
But we had a deal!
- What about me?
- What about you?
If you ever see this again, stop.
The Uruks are something to fear.
I want to be your guest!
You said no one would refuse me!
<i>I said no honourable man would refuse.</i>
<i>Hey!</i>
Hey, water.
Thank you.
- Does anybody speak English?
- English?
<i>English.</i>
English. Uh... Shetan.
<i>Cheval. Shetan. Hey, wait a minute. Wait!</i>
Where are you going?
Is anybody going to?
Please, keep quiet.
- You speak English.
- Shh!
You must not let them know.
Take this fruit. Sit next to me.
You lie still and listen.
My name is Raj.
I'm Alec Ramsey.
Where did you learn English?
In school. I'm on my way
back from the university.
- What do you know of Shetan?
- He's my horse.
Shetan belongs to
Jakub Abu Ben Ishak.
Mr Ben Ishak, he kidnapped him
from me in New York.
Ben Ishak has him?
- Yeah, he's taking him to Wadi Draa.
- Speak softly.
I'm trying to get to Sahli.
- Do you know where that's at?
- Of course.
- Is this truck gonna go there?
- No.
- Well, will you go there?
- No.
- Can I walk there?
- Never. You must have a camel.
What is a child like you doing here alone?
Why don't you go back to America?
Hey! Where are you goin'?
- Where are you goin'?
- Go away. You cannot come with me.
You will not wait long.
Other trucks will pass this way.
What about you?
- I am meeting someone.
- I'll wait with you.
No. Go away from me.
- Stop!
- I'm hot.
You stop! You must wet your headcloth!
Four men could have drunk
from what you spill on the ground!
You would be wise to return to
your people as soon as possible.
Not without my horse.
Shetan is not yours.
He belongs to this desert.
You must forget him.
But I can't.
What do you think will happen
if you get to Wadi Draa?
That Ben Ishak will
give you back the horse?
Do you think you can bring the horse
back across the desert on your own?
I don't know.
Who is it?
Meslar. He will take me home.
Take you home? Is he your father?
No. He will keep me from harm.
<i>Amerícaní.</i>
<i>Amerícaní?</i>
<i>He thought you were one of his people.</i>
When you did not answer him,
he was deeply insulted.
- He asks for your forgiveness.
- Sure. Tell him not to worry about it.
We'll give you some dates.
If you turn back, there is no danger.
Please take me with you to Sahli.
Please don't go without me.
I've gotta find my horse.
I want to be your guest.
And his, too.
I want to be under your protection.
We cannot refuse.
But you remember,
a guest must also honour his host.
Come on, Abdul.
It is believed that sitting under
a thorn bush will give sight
to evil creatures that Allah has blinded.
And the Tuareg believes that throwing
a pebble will keep them blinded.
And do you believe that?
You do not see me throwing
a pebble, do you?
<i>He's a child.</i>
Alec.
<i>¶ Home, home on the range</i>
<i>¶ Where the deer and the antelope play</i>
<i>¶ Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word</i>
<i>¶ And the skies are not cloudy all day</i>
<i>¶ Home, home on the range</i>
Hear me. We are coming
to the oasis at Sahli.
- I am in danger from the Uruk.
- The Uruk?
Just do as you are told,
and we will evade them.
Keep your face covered.
Everyone will believe you are a Tuareg.
If anyone speaks to you, you answer
with this gesture Meslar makes.
It means you cannot speak.
You have no tongue.
<i>Black?</i>
You must not leave our side.
- But I thought I saw the Black, Raj.
- Abu Ben Ishak is not stupid.
He would not bring Shetan here
in the daylight.
- How come?
- The Uruk, child.
<i>Ah!</i>
Raj! The Uruk! The Uruk!
Kurr - he is here! Alec! Come here!
You! Alec, come back. I am your friend.
- Alec!
- Wait!
Come here!
Follow me!
Ben Ishak!
Shetan! He is here!
To the well! I must have Shetan!
You and I must go
to the edge of the oasis.
- We must escape the Uruk.
- But what about the Black?
Child, there is nothing
can be done now. Follow!
Stay down! We are safe here.
- We will wait for Meslar.
- You don't understand.
Black?
<i>Black!</i>
No!
Shetan! Stop!
Black!
<i>Shetan!</i>
No! No!
Black... no!
Here. No, take the tea.
It will calm you.
Black is safe. The Uruk dare not follow
Ben Ishak. He and his men are too strong.
The Uruk are cowards.
I gotta find my horse, Raj.
I know.
But did you ever think that maybe
your horse is better off living here,
in the desert where he belongs?
He belongs with me.
<i>Raj! Raj!</i>
Meslar says there is no water.
Look! The Uruk! Quickly!
Come, Alec! We must go!
Meslar will protect us. Come!
- Where are we going?
- To Sahli.
Sahli? What about Wadi Draa?
You will be safe in Sahli.
In the desert, you will have feet of butter.
Don't worry about me.
You are my guest.
You are under my protection.
What do you think will happen in Sahli?
The Uruk were waiting for Mr Ben Ishak.
I bet they're still there
expecting you to come back.
I ain't goin' back there.
If the Black's in Wadi Draa,
then that's where I'm going.
And how far do you think you'll get?
- All the way.
- You are a child!
<i>You're the child.
You can't move without a bodyguard.</i>
Alec... wait!
Come.
<i>Wow.</i>
You may have it...
in exchange for Meslar's sword.
I'm ready to carry it now.
She is the mother horse.
It is said that all horses come from her.
And to touch her will make
a rider be one with his horse.
- May it give me skill to win the race.
- You're riding in the race?
Yes.
That is why I am going home.
And why the Uruk wish to stop me.
For the same reason
they wish to stop Shetan.
Because Ben Ishak's clan and
my father's clan have won many times.
Is there a race every year?
Every five years.
Every desert tribe lives for it.
We train and breed for five years,
for stamina and speed.
If we lose, we lose more than the race.
We lose the best from our herd.
You mean Mr Ben Ishak
could lose the Black?
If Shetan loses the race, yes.
- And the Uruk could win him?
- No. Never.
The Uruk horses are rogues with no heart.
But there will be other horses.
Some, perhaps,
with greater heart than Shetan.
Raj, are we gonna make it?
The well is dry.
Hey, water!
Raj, is she gonna be all right?
She's weak.
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Shh.
Her flesh... it will give us
a few more hours of life.
Raj!
Raj!
Hey, Raj!
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
- Here is Sagr.
- Raj, she's beautiful.
You will ride with me.
I can go no further.
I am not welcome in Ben Ishak's kingdom.
Follow this gorge to your Black.
For your journey.
If you ever again wish
to cross the desert, Alec,
I would consider it a great privilege
to accompany you.
Me too.
Bye, Raj!
Bye, Alec!
Black!
Whoa, Black.
Let go of me! Black!
Black!
Easy, boy.
<i>Black?</i>
Young man, you are courageous
to have come this far.
I came for my horse.
I have told you before,
he is not your horse.
And you will not stay here.
But I want to be your guest.
You are resourceful, young man.
You know I cannot refuse.
But... you will do nothing
to interfere with Shetan.
- You may rest here.
- Thank you.
Good morning, sir.
Here is Aisha.
Now, Aisha... is Shetan's dam.
After the last race, she was taken
from me by the winner, Abd Al Rahman.
She was heavy with
her first foal... Shetan.
I had to trade many,
many horses to get her back,
for I knew that this foal
was to be the culmination
of all our efforts.
I have sacrificed the wealth of my people
for this one horse.
I cannot fail.
<i>If you really want the Black to win,
you should let me ride him.</i>
Your offer is very kind,
but he will be ridden
by the best rider of my tribe.
There is Shetan's rider.
Hyah!
Whoa! Whoa!
Hyah! Hyah!
So... you are surprised?
Well, yeah. But I wasn't
riding the Black, you know.
It is said that for every great horse,
there is but one rider.
I am Shetan's rider.
I don't think so.
- Easy, Black.
- You must not interfere.
No, Black!
<i>Shetan!</i>
Among Berbers, there is a time
to welcome a guest...
and a time to bid him goodbye.
- What do you mean?
- I have arranged an escort
to accompany you to Casablanca...
- tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
I have asked you not
to interfere with Shetan.
<i>- You are confusing him.
- You should let me ride him for you.</i>
You are a threat to my people.
You will leave tomorrow.
I wish to speak to you for a moment.
I know that you believe your love for
Shetan is more important than anything.
But you are wrong.
The survival of my people
is more important.
You would be very selfish to deny this.
I have not been with Shetan
since he was stolen.
- You know him.
- So?
I think my grandfather
might let you stay for the race
if you help me with Sh... the Black tonight.
- What do you mean, help you?
- I must be able to ride him, Alec.
How are ya, huh?
I think he's gonna like you fine.
Will you help me on him?
Now?
There's so little time, Alec.
Whoa.
Shetan!
I will try again.
The Uruk!
Alec, the Uruk! They're after Shetan!
Alec, that way! Go that way!
Let go of me!
Come on, Black. Come on, Black!
Come on, Black! Come on, Black!
Hey!
Shetan... bad.
Black!
Stop!
Stop! I want to talk to you! A deal!
I only make deals with honourable men!
Whoa, Black. Shh. Shh.
Let's go. Come on!
Alec! Alec!
Meslar! I thought you were dead.
Hey! Alec, it's me!
- Alec! Are you all right, Alec?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
The Uruk!
- I got away.
- Ah!
I'm sorry, sir. I had to.
My kingdom... is in your hands.
I appeal to you, on behalf of my people,
to help us by riding
your Black in the race.
<i>My Black?</i>
I see now that you are
the one rider for the horse.
He has no other master.
But if you want to keep him,
you must win the race.
I pray he has the stamina.
Shetan.
Come.
- What's he talkin' about, Raj?
- I will tell you. I will tell you.
- What was that all about?
- The landmarks in the racecourse.
Are there gonna be flags or something?
No.
But you do not worry. You follow me.
- I will not mislead you, Alec Ramsey.
- I know.
- But I gotta win.
- So must I.
Hyah!
<i>Hey!</i>
Whoa!
Hyah! Hyah!
Whoa.
Whoa, Sagr! Whoa!
Alec! Alec!
Here, Alec! Here!
Raj.
It's a Uruk. The grey horse.
- The rider, he knocked me off.
- Yeah, me too.
No, Alec. This way is better.
Follow!
- All right, Meslar!
- Meslar!
Whoo!
It is just you and I now, Alec.
Alec, look!
<i>Stop my horse!</i>
<i>- Shoot! You shoot!
- Moí?</i>
<i>Shoot, ímbécíle. Shoot! Shoot!</i>
Come back! I want to talk to you!
A deal!
Son of a bitch!
You will always be
as a brother to me, Alec.
Alec.
He is my friend, sir.
Your friend's horse... is spared.
<i>Meslar! Meslar!</i>
No! No!
Come on. Come on, babies.
Come on, babies.
Come on. Yeah. Come on.
Come here.
Come on, come on.
Come here, come here.
How's my boy, huh? How are ya?
I think he belongs here.
Maybe I'll be back.
