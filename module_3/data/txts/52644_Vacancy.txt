Son of a bitch.
What are you doing?
There's a goddamn raccoon
in the middle of the road.
Jesus.
Well, better to kill us
than get a little roadkill
on the car, huh?
Well, we're still alive.
I can tell by the pissy look
that you're giving me.
This isn't the interstate.
There was a wreck.
It was all backed up.
I took a shortcut.
To where?
Can you hear that?
Hear what?
I think the engine
just made a noise.
Well, it's kind of late
for a breakdown.
Should've stopped somewhere
earlier.
Well, I popped some of those
trucker pills.
I thought I could make it
the whole way.
Where are we?
You were really dreaming
over there earlier.
You were mumbling
and jerking around.
I dreamt you were
trying to kill me.
We were at my parents'
anniversary party,
and my mother
wouldn't stop talking.
You started screaming
you couldn't take it anymore
and then you tried
to strangle me.
Hey, at least you were
dreaming about me, right?
That's kind of an improvement.
Shit.
Jesus.
Mm.
You okay?
I... I keep telling you
how stupid that is to do that.
You oughta just kinda...
bite into the apple
like the rest of the world.
It hurts my teeth.
As bad as cutting
your finger off?
It's not anything.
You want me to drive
for a while?
No. I don't.
Why don't you just go ahead
and go back to sleep?
Remember how Charlie
used to dance around
even when there was
no music playing...?
I'm tired, David.
See, I think that should be us
just about there.
Why didn't you just
stay on the interstate?
Heh. I don't know.
Guess I just wanted to make this
as miserable as possible,
you know?
See just how big a bitch
you'd be about it.
I-I just thought
it would be faster, you know?
Shit.
Is that something?
Do you think
they're closed?
Since 1957.
That's too bad,
'cause they got
good gas prices.
Look, if you're too tired,
I'll drive.
I-I told you, I'm fine.
Okay.
See, that town there.
E-Elida.
You were asleep,
but we went through there
about three hours ago.
Well, that should put us
down here somewhere.
I mean, that's a town.
Downey. I mean, they would have
a real gas station.
If that's really
where we are.
I think that
we're headed south.
I mean, eventually,
we've got to hit a...
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
It's okay.
You got to me
right before I headed out.
I'm sorry.
I gotta warn you, though.
The...
The gas price is a little
steeper than the sign says.
Actually, we're just...
We're having, uh,
some engine problems.
Yeah, he dodged a squirrel
a few miles back.
It's a raccoon.
Yeah.
And we're lost.
Well, she's lost.
I actually know
exactly where we are.
We're on our way to Downey.
He's trying to tell you
it's the other way, David.
Yeah. Sorry, man.
It's okay.
It's really easy to get
turned around out here
without a map.
Downey's, like,
30 miles back, man.
Really?
Look, I'll tell you what.
Um, pop the hood.
I'll check the engine and make
sure you can get that far.
Really? Thanks.
That would be great.
Great.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, I went off the road there
when I missed the raccoon.
I think I hit a low spot.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
Is he gonna fix it?
What do you think?
Well, the, uh...
The fan blade's bent.
Rock must have hit it. Heh.
Yeah, she'll drive fine,
just noisy.
That's all.
You might wanna have someone
smarter than me
take a look at it
when you get where you're going.
I'll do that. Thanks.
So now, what do I owe you?
Oh, no, nothing.
No, we're good.
Hell, I should pay you
for finally giving me
something to do.
Now, um, do you need help
getting back to Downey?
Yes.
Well, actually,
i-if you could just point us
towards the interstate,
that'd be great.
Oh.
Well, you don't want
Downey, then.
Okay.
I'll tell you what you do.
You take this road here, right?
And...
And you follow it down
until you hit
a grove of trees on your right.
You take that.
Keep going
till you hit Westcliff.
It'll be a four-lane there.
Westcliff.
Make a left on that,
and that'll take you
where you need to be.
Okay.
Thank you.
Perfect. Thanks a lot.
And you know what?
Man, I'd feel a lot better
if you just took this.
Thanks for staying out so late
and helping us.
Well...
you just bought yourself
a 20-dollar sparkler, then.
Because every day's
4th of July's at Small's.
Owner makes me say that.
Heh-heh!
Here you go.
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.
And drive careful.
Okay, thanks.
Guess I ought to buy you
a box of those sparklers, huh?
So how far did he say
this Westcliff place is?
He didn't.
And I can't even find it
on the fucking map.
David.
What, did we hit something?
Fucking...
Yeah, probably another squirrel.
You know,
i-it was a fucking raccoon.
Whatever.
I mean, Jesus Christ,
why do you have...
Oh, what the hell?
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch.
So much for being able
to drive it the whole way.
God. Perfect. No signal.
Damn it.
Can't a car run
without a fan?
Evidently not.
Okay, give it a try for me,
all right?
It's not gonna work.
Jesus Christ.
Would...?
Would you just give it a try
for me, please, honey?
Goddamn it.
So how far back
was the gas station?
I don't know.
About a mile?
Kind of a long walk
in the middle of the night.
Yeah. I mean,
I guess we could just sit here
and hope some idiots like us
come along
and give us a hand, huh?
I didn't get us lost.
No. You...
You slept for 300 miles,
thanks to your
Zoloft-Prozac cocktail.
Fuck!
Well...
at least we know
there's someplace back there.
Oh, yeah, the guy that helped us
so much before.
Well, you know,
you could get
another sparkler, Amy.
Asshole.
Whatever you say.
Grow a penis.
Never see stars anymore.
At least not in L.A.
Kind of nice out here,
really.
I bet Charlie
would have liked it.
We should've brought him
sometime.
We never went anywhere.
The job was always
too important to leave.
Why do you do that?
What?
Every time I mention his name,
you take a shot at me.
Well, stop mentioning his name.
See, I'm not like you.
I'd rather
just kind of remember him
and deal with the pain.
Okay, you know what, David?
Do what you want.
He said he was getting ready
to close, remember?
Shit.
Look, let's just go back
to the car.
You can sleep on the hood
and stare up at the stars
you love so much.
Maybe they'll know
where we can find the guy.
Oh, God.
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh.
What is that?
I want to go.
No.
It's okay.
David.
Let's just go back
to the car.
What are you doing?
Don't ring the bell.
Sorry.
Hey, folks.
Hi.
How can I help you?
Everything, uh,
okay back there?
Oh!
Can we just...?
Can we just go?
It's okay.
Sorry.
Things get a little boring
around here late nights.
I believe that.
Say, um, there's a mechanic
at the garage over there.
He helped us with our car
earlier. You know him?
I think he's gone home
for the night.
He'll probably be back
tomorrow morning.
Right.
Well, I was wondering
if you could get in touch
with him.
The car actually broke down
about two miles back there.
We just walked up here.
I sure can't. I sure can't.
I'm sorry.
Do you know
another garage?
Hm...
There's Clark's...
about 20 miles east.
Okay.
Well, may I borrow
your phone?
I'd like
to give them a call,
see if they can maybe come out
and give us a hand.
All I got's a payphone,
right out there.
That's great.
Works on dimes
if you need 'em.
Okay, I do.
It's real.
No, i-it doesn't have to be
exact change.
Mm-hm.
Thank you.
Trouble is...
Clark's won't be open either.
Not this late.
So I guess
I don't need these, huh?
Not if you need a garage.
Yeah. We do.
But like I said,
guy over there will be, uh,
back around 8,
if you can wait that long.
I'm sure he can get you
up and running.
Meanwhile, I'm wide open here.
Shocking.
Okay. Thanks.
Well, uh...
we can either stay here,
or we walk all the way back
to the car.
David, this is a fucking
nightmare. I don't know.
Yeah, we'll go ahead
and stay here, thanks.
I can give you two
the honeymoon suite
for $5 extra.
It's got a few perks
the others don't.
Regular room
will be fine.
Thank you.
What the heck?
I'll give it to you
for the same rate.
Well, whatever works.
Whatever's fastest.
All right,
I'll give you my card.
Ooh, we're not set up
for plastic here, friend.
Cash only.
Okay.
I got cash.
I guess you don't take dimes,
though, do you?
Just kidding around.
Ah.
I'm gonna need to see ID
on one of you.
Sort of a deposit
on the room's contents...
Look, sir, you... We're...
You can trust us.
We're not gonna steal anything.
I'm not up to lugging a bunch
of dirty towels back to the car
in the morning, so...
I'm... I'm...
I'm sure you won't,
but rules are rules.
I don't make 'em.
I'm just a manager.
Of course. Here you go.
It's right there on the corner,
Number 4.
Might have to jiggle the handle
a little bit to open her up.
She's as sticky as an old whore.
Right.
'Scuse my language, ma'am.
Y'all have a great night.
Let's go. Thank you.
Oh, this is great.
Good thing we upgraded.
Ugh.
We've had our tetanus shots,
right?
Oh, hey, if you wanna know
what's on March of '97,
I got the answer.
I'm sleeping in my clothes.
I'm gonna sleep
in my shoes.
I guess it could be worse,
you know.
We could be stuck in that
twin bed at your folks' house,
trying to pretend
like we're a happy couple.
God, I should have
told my mom about us.
I... Well, why ruin
their party, though?
I think the thing to do
is just tell them
after we've signed the papers.
It felt really strange
to be at that party.
Watching them all celebrate
being together all those years.
How did it make you feel?
I don't know.
Tired.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Never should've gotten off
the interstate, either.
And miss our one last
great adventure together?
Yeah.
David.
Sorry.
Concierge.
Hello?
Hello?
There's no one there.
Jesus Christ.
What the hell is that?
Hello?
You heard that, right?
Uh-huh.
Don't touch that.
Who is it?
Stay there.
David, wait.
Yeah?
David, don't.
It's coming from the room
next door, Amy.
I know. Don't open it.
Yeah, what do you need?
Hello?
When we walked over here,
were there any cars
in the parking lot?
Just check.
Ugh.
There's a truck.
It's probably
the manager guy's.
I don't know what the deal is,
but it's...
It's a little late
for this shit, okay?
So...
Close the door, David.
Close the door!
Damn it!
Why mess with them?
No, I'm not messing
with them.
I'm just trying to figure out
what they're doing.
Just wait.
Who is it?
I don't know
what your problem is, asshole!
I won't fucking go along
with this, goddamn it.
Oh, David, don't.
I'm gonna call the manager
and tell him
someone's bothering us.
Why don't you open the door?
Play some games? I'll play
some fucking games with you.
That's real funny, jerk-off.
Lock the door.
What?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go take care
of this prick.
Everything all right,
Mr. Fox?
Uh, no, because the asshole
in the room right beside us
keeps banging on the walls
and he won't stop.
You got any ideas?
The room beside you?
Yeah, Room 3.
Uh, I go over there to talk
to the guy
and try and get him to stop,
but he just kinda
keeps doing it.
So, uh, I gotta say,
I-I don't know
what his problem is.
Now, that is very strange,
seeing as you folks
are the only guests
I got in here tonight.
Well, somebody's
in there, okay?
And I gotta say,
I'm pretty exhausted.
You...
You sure it's Room 3?
Yeah, we're in the corner,
right? Number 4?
Well, it's the room
right beside us
with the big, rusty 3
on it, okay?
So I'm pretty sure.
Okay, okay.
Every once in a blue moon
a college kid or drifter
will sneak in through the window
for a good night's sleep.
In the morning the cleaning lady
will find trash on the floor
or shit in the toilet.
Usually they don't cause much
of a disturbance, so...
Well, this one is, okay?
Let me go
check it out for you.
And, uh, if those work,
I'd think about bringing one.
Oh.
I am ass-tired
of shooting at crows.
Give me a hand.
Okay.
It's okay.
So, what happened?
What did he say?
He just thinks
it's some drunk.
He's gonna
take care of it.
Did you hear anything else?
No.
I was kinda hoping
I would.
Then I'd know
where they were.
Well, I'm sure they just saw me
walk over there
and then they took off.
Now we get to enjoy
this luxury resort
in peace and quiet.
David, maybe we should
just leave.
Just go back to the car.
I'm not gonna walk
any more tonight, okay?
Let's just... Just gut it out
here for a few hours.
We'll get the car fixed.
We'll just get the hell
out of here.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
You're not watching that
right now?
No, why?
Look, I'm just gonna unwind
a little bit.
And make sure the guy
from next door is gone.
You gotta take advantage
of the perks.
It's worth
the extra five bucks.
Or is it?
God!
Shit.
W-what is it?
This bathroom's
disgusting.
Yeah?
David?
Yes?
That manager guy's definitely
going over there, right?
Yeah, with a six-shooter.
Gonna take care of it,
so just relax.
Gotta make sure his only
two guests are happy.
This looks like
a real library of classics.
Jesus.
Bet this really gets
the honeymooners in the mood.
Can you turn that off?
It's the last thing
I need right now.
Well, the least they could do
is give us a little porn.
Can't you just mute it
or something,
so I don't have to hear it?
<i>You get the fuck out of here!</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
I told you
to turn it off.
What is it?
David?
Do you...?
Do you see that room?
From the movie?
What about it?
What movie is that?
I... I...
I don't fucking know.
Holy.
David, is that this room?
It sure looks like it.
This has to be
some kind of joke, right?
I mean, that can't be real.
That can't be real.
<i>Steven!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>No! No!</i>
Oh, my God!
<i>No! No!</i>
What happened?
It's okay.
Oh, my God.
It's okay.
David.
Shh.
<i>No!</i>
I'm calling the police.
Oh, shit!
Okay, we gotta get out of here.
All right? All right.
What do we do?
Wait, hold on.
Whoever was outside,
they heard the TV, right?
So they know
we watched it, right?
That asshole put us in here
to watch it. He was...
He was never gonna help us.
He was part of this.
I know. So they know
we fucking watched it,
know we're gonna try and run.
They're gonna be waiting.
Maybe they don't know
we caught on.
No, wait a second!
He knows.
He knows.
Okay, so, what now?
We'll climb out this way.
Come on!
It's fucking nailed shut!
David, they'll hear you.
Let's just sneak out the door.
Amy, they're not just gonna
fucking let us
stroll out there
and call the cops!
Well, they're not gonna let us
just sit in here, either!
Fuck!
David.
What?
Did you bring this?
No.
Well, I didn't bring it either.
Didn't you bring it
from the car?
No, I bled all over it,
remember?
I wouldn't have brought it.
I left it in the car.
What's happening?
I don't know.
Well, how'd it get
in here?
I don't know.
Dim the lights.
What are we doing?
We're leaving.
Okay, when we get outside,
we're gonna go
to the trees, okay?
Where they can't see us.
We gotta move fast, Amy.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, we're gonna run
right over there, all right?
Just stay with me.
Oh! David!
Oh, my God!
Come on!
Oh!
Come on!
Unh!
Open the...
Get the bathroom window open!
It's nailed shut.
Just try, okay?
Turn off the light.
David.
They're out there.
At the window.
I got a gun!
Get away or I swear to God
I'm gonna fucking use it!
God, leave us alone!
I don't see anybody.
Well, they wouldn't just leave.
No, they wouldn't.
David, don't!
They're in there.
If they wanna come in here,
they're gonna come in here.
It doesn't matter. We gotta find
another way outta here now.
I need to get
to that phone.
No, you're not
going out there.
Listen, Amy.
It's a real phone, okay?
It'll help.
They're not gonna
let you get to it.
Please, David,
don't go out there.
Look, look.
If we stay here,
we're gonna wind up
like all of them.
Please.
We know that they were outside
watching that window.
If we can just keep
their attention on that,
it'll give me time
to get to the phone.
Well, how can we do that?
Please hurry.
Come on, come on.
<i>911 Emergency.</i>
Yeah, hello.
W-w-we need some help.
Some people
are trying to kill us.
<i>Where are you located, sir?</i>
Me and my wife
are at this motel.
The Pinewood Motel.
It's near the mountains.
They've... They've...
They've got us trapped.
<i>Who has you trapped, sir?</i>
I... I don't know.
We just need help.
The Pinewood Motel.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Do you have an address?</i>
No, I don't.
It's near some side road.
Jesus Christ, look it up!
<i>You're going to need</i>
<i>to settle down, sir.</i>
<i>You'll never survive</i>
<i>if you lose control, Mr. Fox.</i>
<i>And you shouldn't be wandering</i>
<i>around in the dark by yourself.</i>
Did you get anyone
on the phone?
No.
Why the fuck
are they doing this?
Listen.
It's getting light.
They're gonna want this
to be over soon, okay?
We need something.
Some scissors, anything.
The knife from your apple.
It's in the car.
Nothing in here!
This'll have to do.
You're bleeding.
What do you
think they're doing?
I think they're
enjoying themselves.
You let me fall asleep.
It's all right.
It was just
'cause of your pills.
Oh, I have to be awake.
No. I need you to stay there.
What?
They're watching you.
And they're listening.
I didn't want them
to watch what I was doing,
but they need to see you.
Okay?
So they don't think
we're trying to get out.
Okay?
Wait, what are you doing?
Going through the tapes.
They have cameras everywhere,
even outside.
Then they edit 'em all together.
Remember the screaming
from the TV
the guy was watching
in the office?
I'm sure it was one of these.
It's not enough that they rob
and kill these people,
they wanna watch it too.
Why are you watching 'em?
I'm looking for mistakes.
These people,
they weren't smart.
They thought the room
would protect 'em, and it won't.
They can come in
anytime they want.
They just watch
until they get bored.
See? Right there.
It happens
in almost every one of these.
He just shows up.
Well, how'd he get inside?
He wasn't in here before.
He didn't come
through the door.
I-I can't tell
from the others, but...
w-with this angle...
Right there.
It's the bathroom.
A-and that's where
your apple came from.
Just stay here.
David.
I saw lights.
Someone's here.
Come on.
Wait. We don't know
who he is.
He's a ride
out of this place.
Yeah, unless he's
one of them.
I mean, what the fuck's
he doin' here so late?
Maybe he's lost.
That could happen.
He looks like he's been driving
a long time.
He's not one of them.
He could help us.
Come on.
Wait.
You can't go out there.
Help!
Over here, sir!
Help!
Hey, come here!
Oh, he's coming.
No, they won't let him.
He needs to get in the truck.
The truck!
I'm gonna tell him.
David.
What?
Fuck, no.
No!
Turn around.
Turn around!
Turn around.
They're behind you!
Turn around!
Hey! Heh-heh.
Wasn't sure
you were gonna make it.
You got 'em all?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, my God.
Fuck. Okay, come on.
Come on.
Okay, go.
What's in there?
Go. Come on.
We can't go in that.
We don't know what's in there.
We don't have any choice.
Amy, we have
to do this, okay?
Come on.
Just follow me.
I'm gonna lead us outta here.
It's gonna be okay.
This is gonna lead us
outta here.
I can't.
I have to go back.
Hey. We can't.
They're gonna be waiting for us.
I can't breathe.
Yes, you can, all right?
Just close your eyes,
grab ahold of my leg.
I'm gonna lead us.
It's not much further.
Come on.
Come on.
It's okay.
David, please.
It's gonna fall.
No, it's not.
Come on. Come on.
Shit! Oh, fuck.
What?
What's the matter?
You can't scream, Amy.
What?
They're gonna hear ya
if you scream.
Okay? Just keep moving.
We're almost there.
What's that?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Shit.
I see something.
What is it?
Door, maybe.
Where are we?
<i>This is what you get.</i>
Where are we?
Shh! Shh-shh-shh!
<i>We haven't done
anything to you.</i>
<i>Please, you could be my son.</i>
<i>You could be my son.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, don't.</i>
<i>You can't.</i>
<i>Who are you guys?</i>
<i>You can have anything.</i>
<i>Please, don't kill me.</i>
Help me.
<i>Please don't.</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>
<i>You can have money.</i>
<i>Please, no.</i>
<i>Ah! Please!</i>
Oh, God.
We're no better off
than we were.
No, look,
we're still alive.
Okay, there has to be something
in here we can use.
<i>911 Emergency.</i>
Yeah, they're trying to kill us.
We...
<i>I need your name and location.</i>
Okay.
Well, they're out there
somewhere.
<i>Ma'am?</i>
<i>Hello? I need your name</i>
<i>and location, ma'am.</i>
<i>Ma'am?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!
Get down there after 'em.
Bitch!
They're under us!
They'll find us
in here.
Well, we can't try to run.
Not yet.
We have to let them think
we got away,
let them go after us.
Then we can try to run.
Well, what if they look
in here first?
Jesus, Amy. I don't know.
I'm doing the best
I can over here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
No.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
I'm the one that got off
the interstate.
No, I...
I mean for everything else.
I'm sorry about us.
And about Charlie.
I should've made sure
the gate was up.
I shouldn't have let him
near the stairs.
It's not your fault, okay?
None of it was.
It was an accident.
Please. You have to stop
blaming yourself, all right?
No one else does.
It's okay. It's okay.
Listen.
We just have to make it
out of this.
All right?
Everything starts over
once we make it out of this.
All right?
Promise.
It's the 911.
Hold on. Hold on.
It could be one of them,
like the truck driver.
When you called 911,
you didn't tell 'em
where we were.
Why would they be here now?
Well, maybe they
traced the call.
Yeah.
Gosh.
You sure it came from here?
It's just me tonight.
And you run the place?
Oh, yeah.
Then I won't disturb anybody
if I...
take a look around?
No.
No, no.
Haven't had a guest here
in three nights.
Slow season, huh? Hm?
Yeah, well, all four of 'em.
That happen tonight?
These goddamn kids.
Come around and...
vandalize stuff.
I just haven't gotten around
to cleaning that up.
Been too busy
with all the guests, huh?
That's right.
I probably should
look in these rooms.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Wrong keys.
Let me head back
to the office.
I'll be right back.
They're looking for us.
Maybe he's here to help us.
No. He isn't.
He wouldn't just let him
walk around like that.
Hello?
When I called 911
it was the guy from the office
that answered the phone.
He looks scared.
I think he has one of the tapes.
He's gonna leave, David.
He's leaving.
Help us!
No, wait, wait, wait.
Get in the car.
Let's go.
How many are there?
Three, I think.
Come on, let's go.
What's the matter?
They're trying to make sure
we can't leave.
Well, I'm not gonna give 'em
a choice.
Stay here.
Shit.
Oh!
Get out.
Had to drag him into this,
didn't you?
You might as well have
stuck that knife
into his back yourself.
Oh, my God,
they killed him.
David, they killed him.
David, we're not gonna
fit through there.
Okay, they're going
around the other side.
If I can get in the office,
they keep some guns there.
Okay, this is gonna work.
What?
We'll leave them a trail.
Watch out.
Come on.
They'll think you made it
out the window.
They won't look up here.
Come on, get up here.
Give me your foot.
Just get up there. You got it?
Okay. Go right over there.
Okay. Stay still.
What about you?
The office and get
that fucking guy's gun.
No, don't leave me here. Please.
I have to.
It's only for a second.
All right? I swear to you.
Please, I don't wanna do this.
No. We have to.
This is our only shot.
You just gotta be really quiet.
You don't make a sound.
Whatever happens...
just don't make a sound.
All right?
We're gonna make it out of this.
Promise?
I promise.
Now shut that.
Amy
I love you.
Oh, my God...
Come on, come on.
Come on.
All right, get her out here.
Let's do this thing.
Go find her.
Oh, God!
David.
What the fuck?
Aw...
God! God! God!
Oh!
God. Fucking...
God. Fucking bitch.
Fucking, fucking bitch.
Fuck!
You fucking...
Be still now. Be still!
Bitch.
Fuck!
You fucking bitch. Come on.
Get up there.
Get up there, I said.
Get your head up.
Think you were gonna
walk outta here, huh?
Fucking bitch.
Put your head up.
Look here.
Should've killed you last night.
That's what I should've done.
I could've killed you
last night.
I should've killed
you last night.
Now shut the fuck up
and get your face up.
Look at me. Get your face up.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Huh? You think you can
fuck with this?
You think you can fuck with me?
Hey. Look at me.
Look in my eyes.
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Hey, look at me!
Fuck you!
Ah!
Fucking bitch.
David.
Can you hear me?
I'm gonna get help.
<i>911 Emergency.</i>
Please, we need your help.
My husband, he's...
<i>What's your name</i>
<i>and location, ma'am?</i>
Amy Fox.
We're at the Pinewood Motel.
I-I don't know the address,
but, please, you have to hurry.
<i>An officer already responded</i>
<i>to that location.</i>
And they killed him.
Please, you're the police.
You can't let my husband die.
<i>Okay, someone's on their way.</i>
Okay.
Oh.
I love you.
