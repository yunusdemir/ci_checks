JEFF:
Now, you're gonna love it.
There's no professors,
there's no papers,
there's just peace and relaxation,
the entire time.
And relentless pounding
for, like, six days.
[LAUGHTER]
Gross. And beer!
Don't forget about the beer.
And how can we forget about beer
with you in the car?

The hell's goin' on out here?
Dennis!
Goddammit! What'd I tell you
about biting city folk?
Hey, it's not his fault.
Take it easy on him.
Take it easy?
Don't you tell me
how to raise my boy, boy.
Dennis isn't like
the other children.
Everybody knows
you don't talk to 'em.
Maybe you should make a sign,
for the rest of us.
Come on, get outta here.
There's a hose around back,
you wanna wash that hand up.
It's the best I can offer.
- Paul, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
Hey, "Deliverance"!
Think it's smart
leaving your kid out here
knowing he's a danger to people?
What are you trying
to say exactly?
What I'm saying is...
that such an incident
were to result in a lawsuit,
you may be held liable.
We don't know nothin'
about that around here.
Come on, Tommy.
Peace and relaxation, remember?
God.
What just happened?
[GRUNTS]
Aah, shit.
[SIGHS]
Freakin' hillbilly vampires.
[SIGHS]
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
I'd be careful with that.
What is it?
This is... fox piss.
You'd even drop that on ya,
you'll have every animal in the county
wanting to hump your leg.
Hmm.
You should get some of that
for your mom.
Hmm.
I'm gonna go get the beer.
You kids here on vacation
or you just passin' through?
Vacation.
Ah. Well.
I hope you enjoy our little slice
of heaven as much as we do.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'll be fine.
Just, just kids.
Uh, I have a first-aid kit in the car.
I'll grab it.
Thanks.
Uh, seeing
as you're such a fine group,
I feel it's my...
...civic duty to warn ya.
Be careful out there.
Especially...
...you go hiking in those woods?
What's in the woods?
Bad stuff.
It's nothing we can't handle.
I'm sure.
Lyme Disease
is pretty bad in these parts.
All I can say is check for ticks.
Why? What happened?
Few hikers
got real sick last week.
Uh, doctors took care of 'em,
I guess.
What do you mean, uh,
what do you mean you guess?
TOMMY: Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey!
What?
You wanna give me
one good reason
why you'd steal a Snicker's bar?
Huh?
Would you believe me
if I told you it was for the nougat?
The nouga-what now?
Never mind.
Look, I'm sorry. Really.
Seriously, I, sometimes I just
take things, I don't know why.
Get the hell outta here!
Yeah, okay.
Goes for the rest of you, as well.
Get outta here,
before I call the sheriff.
What?
It was an accident.
An accident?

I think w... we'll have fun.
Wow, this place is amazing.
Your mom really hooked this up,
except, uh, I can't find the TV...
You coming?
I'm not getting any bars.
Um...
So no phone, and I'm...
guessing no Internet there.
Whoa, wa-wa-whoa-oh-oh.
No internet?
[LAUGHS]
No weed.
No GTA V, no Black Ops II,
no Stimpy, no Minecraft, no...
weed?
You mentioned weed twice.
Yeah, I know. On purpose.
What, we're talking a whole week
here, there's no way.
Dude, my clan needs me.
Just think of this as gamer rehab,
you'll get over it.
But I don't wanna go
to gamer rehab.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]
[DOOR OPENING, CLOSING]
You brought a gun?
Okay, firstly, it's not a gun.
It's a rifle.
More specifically,
an assault... rifle.
Second, we're in the woods,
so... I thought I'd practice
my survival skills.
Don't you think
that's a little overkill?
No.
Fully upgraded.
Barely legal.
I won't even go into the tech specs
on this beast
'cause you couldn't handle it.
You're gonna accidentally shoot
one of us.
Never happen.
I have years of training.
[PAUL LAUGHING]
PAUL: Video games don't count.
Will you just be careful
with that thing?
Okay, will you relax?
I am perfectly responsible.

away from me.

That's a weird question.

Greasy Toby,
the guy with the OCD?
Yeah. That and ADD.
He tried to kiss me.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
He did?
Mm-hm.
Two days ago.
It's weird, it's like...
...this family friend
I've had for 12 years.
Just... he put his hands on my face
and tongue down my throat,
and it was, was gross,
it was just bad.
What, was it... gross because
you'd known him for so long or...
because he's gross?
Mmm... it was definitely him.
[CHUCKLES]
[SIGHS]
You know, like,
sometimes you've known someone
a really long time,
and you just wanna kiss 'em just
to see if they're a good kisser?
Yeah.
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

what were you shooting at?
Squirrels.

Squirrel, if we can get one.
I'm a vegetarian.
[LAUGHING]
[INSECTS BUZZING]
So, Paul, tell your story.
No, no, man, it's...
It's too traumatic.
I don't want to talk about it.
I like traumatic stories.
I mean, not about me,
but... in general.
Plus, trauma bonds people,
so you can totally
talk to us about it.
Trauma bonds the people
who experience it,
not the people
that you tell the story...
- Just tell the story!
- Fine. Fine.
[LAUGHING]
We used to go to this...
bowling alley...
Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl,
you remember it?
It's in Brighton, right?
Yeah, that's why it's called
"Brighton Bowl".
Okay, guys.
PAUL: Anyway, every weekend
I would go there
either with my dad or for a birthday
party or whatever.
Well, one weekend I asked my dad
if we were going.
He said, no.
He said the alley was closed.
Apparently, some
disgruntled employee
was holding all the other
employees at gunpoint.
The police said
that he tied each hostage
to a chair and arranged them
in a circle.
That way everyone was forced
to look at one another.
Then after that they've been
gagged and beaten,
this maniac breaks out
a ball-peen hammer,
and one by one...
...smashes in the back
of their heads.
[SHIVERS AND LAUGHS]
Can you imagine dying like that?
Just watching
all of your friends dying,
knowing you're next?
I can't.
That's not all.
This guy doesn't stop,
he breaks out the fire axe.
The alarm sounds,
but he doesn't care.
He hacks off all their limbs,
dismembers them completely.
When the police arrived...
they just found six bloody torsos
tied to those colored
bowling chairs, remember?
Blood everywhere.
No sign of the killer, though.
Poof.
And that was your childhood
playground?
Yeah.
True story.
Oh, my God, you were lying?
No, it's true.
You can look it up.
- You fuckers.
- It's not a funny story.
It's Jeff's face
that's making me laugh.
[GASPS]
Oh, shit!
Where the fuck
did you come from?
- You spyin' on us?
- No, not at all.
Just saw your campfire.
I was out on a midnight hike,
I thought I'd come and say hello.
I haven't seen anybody up here
in a week.
Um, can you do something about...
Dr. Mambo.
His name's Dr. Mambo.
At least, that's what I call him.
He seems to like it.
Psychiatrist or pediatrician?
Little of both, I guess.
What are you doing out here?
Same thing you guys are.
Enjoying nature.
Some of the best free climbing
is right here in this valley.
Yeah, I hate heights.
It's definitely not for everybody.
So you don't mind if I sit here
and chill out with you guys
for a bit, do you?
Actually we're having
a... private conversation,
so if you don't mind...
No worries. I get it.
I guess I'll just take
this big bag of weed
and smoke it all by myself.
- Oh, hey...
- No, no, no!
- Sit down.
- Sit down. What are you...?
- Are you sure?
- Hey, no...
I'm so sorry.
What's your name?
Connor.
But you can call me Grim.
Grim, like, uh, Grimace or...?
No.
Just Grim.
Like Death...
Like the Grim Reaper.
I figure I'm gonna die
up in these mountains anyways,
so...
I don't know...
Just a nickname.
I didn't pick it.
[INSECTS BUZZING]
I just came up here
from Berkeley.
Now, that's a party town.
- Karen was just there.
- Oh, yeah?
[LAUGHING]
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh,
I met these guys in...
They wouldn't let me drink
anything but beer
for, like, five days, just solid.
I've done that.
I got drunk.
Actually, sounds
like a pretty cool idea.
- Only drinking beer.
- I could do it.
I don't know if you could.
If that is a challenge, sir,
then, I accept.
All right, fine, from here on out,
we'll only drink beer.
- [THUNDER RUMBLING]
- Deal.
Looks like rain
is headed our way.
It's gonna be a wet one.
Yeah. Party's over.
[THUNDER CONTINUES]
Why don't you, uh, come up
for a minute and hang out?
That's cool, but, uh,
I gotta get back to my tent.
I left all my gear out,
and if it gets wet,
that's $4,000 destroyed.
KAREN:
How far is your campsite?
It's about 20 minutes,
give or take,
but, uh, I can come back.
Can you bring the weed?
Absolutely.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
All right, Dr. Mambo.
Let's hit it.
- [CHUCKLING]
- Huh?
That was pretty weird.
He was okay.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[OWL CALLING]
So how did you do it?
[GIGGLING]
What do you mean, "how"?
It... It was...
Okay, I had different settings, like...
pulse, power, stream,
all different kinds of speeds,
and, uh...
that was on this length of hose
that I could reach
when I lay down in the tub.
[KAREN LAUGHS]
Wait, did you come every time?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.
[LAUGHS]
Tell me about it.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- [LAUGHS]
Wait, I have a better story
than that.
Nah, bullshit, you do.
Nothing beats stories about Karen
and her parents' shower massage.
Thank you.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Ah, it must be the weed guy.
Okay. All right.
[KNOCKING CONTINUES]
<i>Oye, Grimace, we're comin '.</i>
- It's Grim.
- Yup, whatever.
- Help me. Help me, please.
- Oh, my God.
I'm burnin'.
Help me.
I need a doctor.
Uh, ge... get him a blanket.
Oh, shit!
You...
It's you!
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no way...
I'm letting
that contagious freak in.
No, no, Bert, he's sick,
and he needs help, okay?
What? No, look at him.
I mean, he's got something.
He's got something bad.
But we need to call him a doctor
or call someone.
Okay, no, no, no,
we don't have any reception.
Oh, shit.
That freak is going to the car.
What?
Oh, wait, what?
What's he doing? What?

[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[SLURPING]
JEFF: Look...
What were we gonna do?
I mean, this guy,
he gets in the car,
he gets this shit
all over the inside of the car,
he comes at us...
I don't want him to touch me.
I don't want him
to touch any of us.
It was self-defense.
And... it's raining,
so... it probably put him out.
This is some serious real shit.
Yeah, or worse.
I mean, it looked like something
was eating his skin...
...like biohazard style.
Like quarantine.
I think we should tell the police
it wasn't our fault.
We should tell them... now.
We have... we have to go
tell them right now. Please.
That's where reality comes in.
We can't.
I'm not about to ride in that car
with that dude's blood all over it.
Come on.
Tomorrow we can clean it up,
fix the tire,
whatever else is wrong with it,
and report the accident.
The keyword here is "accident".
That guy's skin...
Holy shit.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
[DOOR CLOSING]
What's the plan?
[SIGHS]
Divide and conquer.
You better leave me the rifle.
He's right.
What? Wait a second.
I'm not the one
who went ballistic last night.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means...
you raged out of control,
that's what.
Well, that's fucked up.
No, what's fucked up is you
beating the shit out of my car
with your fuckin' bat.
What about Captain Jack-off
over here with the assault rifle,
you forget about him?
All right, look,
we all fucked up the car.
You guys just gonna keep arguing
or maybe do somethin' about it?
- Where you going?
- To get help.
She's right.

- Jeff and Bert have...
- I know.
I know you know it.
Look, last night, we...
Paul, somebody came to our door
and asked for help,
and we lit him on fire... okay?
He could be anywhere out there,
and I just wanna go home.
Karen, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't mean to do it.
Everything happened so fast.
It was an accident.
Was it?
I don't know about you,
but every time I close my eyes,
I see him burning,
I can see him screaming,
and his skin crackling,
and the smell of his burning hair.
You saw him when he came
to the door last night.
He was very sick.
He was going to die anyway.
You don't know that.
Oh, my God.
[CRYING]
Look...
Look, I can't change
what happened last night.
I wish I could, but I can't.
But if we just work together,
we can fix this.
Okay?

Better?
Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

Now, what am I supposed
to do with a sick hog, huh?
Huh?
I'm not about to eat this meat!
Would you?
N... no. No, I... I...
I'm a vegetarian.
That has nothin' to do with it
because you know
all this stuff is no good.
It's all sick.
It all has to go back.
I want me a new hog.
Yeah, um, we just need
a mechanic,
and we're just wondering...
A mechanic?
You're not gonna find one here.
You got to go into town for that.
Uh, yeah, right.
But that... that's the, um...
[CLEARS THROAT]
...the problem.
Our car is busted,
so we can't... get into town.
We need someone
to take us to town
to get a mechanic.
I already been in town
already today. Sorry.
Uh, well, if you're going to town again,
can you let us know?
We're just stayin' at a cabin
a few miles down the road.

I'm sorry.
Of course, of course.
Heck, why didn't you just come
right out with it?
Here I am,
prattlin' on about my hog,
and you just wanna find somebody
who's gonna find you a mechanic.
[CHUCKLES]
Come on up to the house.
I got a radio inside.
We'll call Ricky.
Uh, he's got a tow truck.
- That would be great.
- Yeah, great.
Thank you. Ricky...
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Sorry to bother you,
but we really appreciate this.

of the woods,
just tryin' to trash our car
or break into it or somethin'.
Sounds terrible.
Uh, you two want
somethin' to drink?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes, please, thank you.
Uh, you said this person
damaged your car?
Yeah, it was this crazy hermit guy,
like, really dangerous.
We just scared him off with bats
and everything.
Crazy hermit guy?
I... It wasn't Henry, was it?
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
- Um, Henry...
- Nah!
Uh, my Cousin Henry.
Uh, he knows better than that.
Did you say you hit him
with bats?
- No.
- No.
- No, no, no.

What he means is, uh, no.
It wasn't Henry.
It was our friend.
JEFF: Walter.
BERT: It was Walter.
Our friend... Walter.
This crazy friend Walter.
He's... He was drunk.
Oh, that's not good.

Let's forget the tow truck.
It's turning into such
a nice day. We'll just walk.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
we'll fix it ourselves.
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
Yeah, absolutely.
Thank you so much.

get themselves shot around here.

Sheriff's Department.
What can I do for ya?
Eh, I'm just out here on patrol.
It's my jurisdiction.
I understand you guys had
a little commotion here last night.
I was hopin' you could tell me
somethin' about that.
Sure, sure. Uh, some...
...guy tried to get
into our cabin.
Uh, he was sick, really sick.
I don't know what kind
of disease he had,
but he was a mess, and...
Yeah.
[CLEARS THROAT]
I kinda have to report this.
My friends are out lookin'
for a neighbor right now,
so we could call you.
We don't have a phone up here.
No, most people got radios.
That's what I got.
It looks like you guys were having
some kinda party last night, huh?
Yeah, you know,
w... we were drinking,
and then this guy came along
and tried to...
He tried to break into our cabin,
and, you know,
uh, we had no choice,
but to get rough with him.
- And we didn't know what to do.
- Stop talkin'.
Yes.
[SNICKERS]
Look, man, I already told you,
makin' a report.
That guy's not gonna come back
and bother you.
I'll bet you scared him off
pretty good, huh?
Besides...
I wouldn't let him ruin the fun.
Thanks, 'cause...

and she's pretty upset

She wants to go home.

Now, that girl... is hot.
If you're askin' me,
you gotta stay and party.
PAUL: Well, you know, that's why
we came here in the first place.
Yeah, boy...
...ain't this some kind
of wonderful... shit?
I'd say that creep really did
a number on your Jeep here.
Do you think you can get
someone up here to fix it?
'Course. I'm not an idiot.
I'll take care of you.
I could probably have
someone here by, uh,
I don't know,
tomorrow afternoon?
I want you to know
you're in my top priority...
...'cause you're my party man...
...and this is party town.
We are are gonna party, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
You know how to find me?
Dial 910?
That's right.
Yeah, that's right.
So take care of that little peach
in there.
She sure looks sweet.

[SIGHS]
[GAGGING]
Oh, shit.
So is she gonna report it
or not report it?
I don't think she is.
But she didn't make it sound
like we did anything wrong.
She said she'll have a tow truck
up here by tomorrow.
Sounds...
...weird.
It was.
How's Karen? Has she
come out of her room yet?
No, I think she's sleeping.
Dude, I don't know
what's up with her,
but she wants to get out of here
as soon as possible.
Well, that kinda screws up
your plan, doesn't it?
[SNIFFLES]
What plan?
Uh, the plan you're being
trying to execute since...
- ...what, eighth grade?
- [SIGHS]
There's no plan.
Not anymore.
All right.
Well, she's a head case, anyway.
All chicks are.
What makes you say that?
Look at her.
I mean, you like her
'cause she's nice to you,
and she likes you
'cause she can control you.

that dog was?
Yeah.
So where's Grim?
Thank you.
I'll tell you where he is.
He's out there rotting.
There's some shit in that woods.
And cousin Henry's
spreading it around.
And I'm not waiting
for the deputy to get back.
I say, we leave right now.
Shouldn't we maybe mention
on the way out
that we burned someone alive?
<i>- PAUL: Yes.
- No.</i>
Jeff.
Fine.
Fuck it.
We'll tell 'em some sick guy came by,
so we set him on fire.
They'll figure it out.
The deputy knows
something happened.
We're the only outsiders here.
They'll trace it back to us.
I feel really nauseous.
Karen.
How soon can you
get us out of here?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
It's okay.
Are you hungry?
No.
I'll let you get back to sleep.
Don't go.

The boat shed.
MARCY:

No, if she's infected
with whatever it is,
we have to quarantine her.
We have to get her away from us,
separate from us.
Just let me go
and check up on her.
Look, they're probably right, okay?
She'll be safe out there.
We can get her a mattress
