She says she can't cure you,
only make you feel better.
She says
you must go see Lalla Chafia.
Maybe she can cure you.
She says she's expecting you.
Who is expecting me?
The saint who heals,
up on the hill.
You must go there.
You climb the hill in the
noon sun, without stopping.
What's at the top of that hill?
Lalla Chafia is there.
She died 159 years ago.
She can heal you from her grave.
She says
your main problem is time.
You wish to reap before you sow.
That is why you are sad.
You have always been a sad lady.
She says living too fast
makes one die too young.
At what age did I die then?
At what time?
Where everything started,
or where it all ended?
Shit, this isn't happening.
What's wrong now?
I didn't get that.
What'd she say?
It's warmer than in Monte Carlo.
No. After that...
That we mustn't call the police
before I get back.
Just a minute...
I love France.
Me too.
You won the pretty car
behind yours.
Oh, no! You're totally nuts.
I should've guessed.
You love surprises.
Why are you selling it?
To build a faster one.
Why do you want a racing boat?
To try and best your record...
Just joking.
Do you know about solitude?
It cures almost everything.
Yes.
Especially loneliness!
She's not a looker,
but she's a safe boat.
Just like women:
The more beautiful,
the more dangerous.
I've the feeling
this boat had a difficult race.
- Which race are you entering?
- My own.
We'll go to the buoy
below the cliffs.
Just beside the jewelry store.
Is that your last price?
It's just what I need
to finish my new boat.
What did you say back there?
What did I say, my love?
You talked of a jewelry store.
Don't you remember?
You said there was
a store at sea.
Please, miss.
Evening, miss.
Why are you going
round in circles?
Willy, the test-balloon.
Can you breathe
into this, please?
What orchestra is this?
What orchestra?
What's the matter?
The matter is
you've been circling
the roundabout non-stop.
So we're entitled
to wonder what's up.
What time is it?
9 pm, but my watch is fast.
Shit, I had an appointment at 8.
Breathe into this, please.
Does this happen often to you?
It's the first I've heard of it.
Negative.
Can I go now?
Do you need help getting back?
No, thanks.
- How long was I circling?
- 5 minutes.
Yes, I'd say a good 5 minutes.
On this Earth
My only joy
My only happiness
Is my man
I gave all I have
My love and my heart
To my man
Even when I dream at night
It is of him
Of my man
It's not that he's handsome
Nor rich, nor well-built
But I love him, it's crazy
I circled the Invalides
some 29 times.
What were you doing there?
They say I had a blackout.
Come again?
They say I had a blackout.
I wish I could've forgotten you.
Ready to order?
Nothing. I'm not hungry, thanks.
And you?
I'm still hesitating.
- As always.
- I'll come back.
Stop hesitating.
Will it be her or me?
The white or the black one?
I don't think
you'll like my choice.
So predictable, you men are.
With you, I wonder if I met
no one, or everyone.
Jane!
When will you slow down a bit?
I had a date
with the man of my life,
and I am talking to a stranger.
You're no trumpet player,
you're the Pied-Piper.
You're angry at me?
For taking 2 months to choose
between my best friend and me?
Yes, I'm angry.
And our life still
fascinates you?
We ask too much of love...
my love!
Have you been faithful
to me during all this time?
Often.
He didn't train very well.
He has family problems, but now
is no time to think of them.
He should forget his wife...
his kids...
- He's getting a beating.
- Go, Daddy.
Go, Daddy.
I found the skipper
quite attractive.
I know...
Thierry.
Yes, he won. It's wild!
I swear, totally wild.
They'll be re-running it.
Seems I sold to the Englishman.
He didn't try to barter.
It should work out...
It's stupid to end like this.
We made a nice trio.
In a trio,
there's always one too many.
I offered him a light life,
he chose a dark life.
I'm sorry.
So... what now?
What now my love
Now that it's over
He always dreamed
of such a boat.
What did he do other than dream?
Unique things.
When you won your round
the world race, he told me:
He's had boats before?
This is his first racing boat,
but he's always lived on boats.
I can tell. He's good.
In a race,
he might not come in last.
Is your wife jealous
of your boats?
I'm the jealous one.
A round the world race
means 199 days away from home.
So there's temptation.
You'll see.
All these boats training,
are they in the race?
Some of them.
When will he be ready to go?
When he feels ready.
To circle the world, the mind
is as important as the boat.
Why'd you close your eyes?
I'm trying to picture life
without him.
I'm cold.
You're not afraid of trouble.
Circled the world 3 times...
thought I'd seen it all,
must've gone
to the wrong places.
You're not going
back to lounges?
It's easy to sing for people
who don't listen.
- Like a nice waiting room.
- What do you want?
I can't stand lies anymore.
Know what my last liar said?
"Lies
"are dreams caught red-handed."
Damn, it's gonna be hard
forgetting that trumpet player.
A.B.C.D.E. F...
Departures don't keep you awake.
I wasn't sleeping.
I was dreaming.
I dreamt of paying back
the people I stole from.
How do you pay
a love story back?
By giving you
a 199-day furlough...
or should I say 199 nights?
I've never wanted to be free.
When I met you
at the jewelry shop,
I thought I'd get
29 years straight.
You gave me
the world's finest jewels,
but no wedding ring.
Who said: "Never wed
your mistress,
"for marriage
is love's perfect murder."?
You have more like that?
A.B.C. D...
A.B.C.D.
Me too.
But you're still leaving.
Just for a short world tour.
There are less risky
vacations...
What with your blackouts
and migraines.
May I have a glass of wine?
What is left of our loves?
What is left of our sweet days?
A picture, an old picture
Of my youth
What is left of love letters?
Of April months,
of rendez-vous?
A souvenir haunting me
Forever
How can I make you understand
I'm not leaving you?
Right! You're leaving
to better find me.
You see a better reason?
From now on
I might turn to women.
We'd have something
more in common.
I hope you enjoyed
your last night?
Very much.
My bill, please.
The next soft bed
is at least 199 days away.
I, too, will be there
to see you off.
Better hurry,
we leave in 4 months.
Let's meet at the harbor.
I don't want to leave you
like this...
My 'Hermes'.
You'll probably need a god.
And Hermes was
the god of thieves.
The bill, please.
No worries about his health,
the sea heals.
Mr. Valentin paid.
He knew there was
a restaurant here.
Did he also know
you'd need a lifeboat?
And you're it?
I'm ready for that sacrifice.
Anything between us
would be like revenge to me.
I wouldn't dare think
you'd like me!
I'm in Paris next week.
Do you want to meet?
Gives you time to think it over.
The thinking's done. Things
like that, it's now or never.
I gathered Valentin
was a bit of a handful,
but I didn't catch on
that he had a whole
"handful club" around him.
Does it turn you on or not?
Just the idea?
I love handfuls,
didn't you notice?
How old are you?
And you?
Like in poker,
I love to go last.
I stopped before
the end of my song?
You stopped
before the end of the song.
You're sure?
If you're interested, I might
have a job in Morocco for you.
Are you in Morocco
for work or tourism?
I am singing for 1 month
in the "Accor" group hotels.
But I hope to do
some sightseeing too.
Nothing to declare?
- Welcome to Morocco.
- Thanks.
Hello, miss,
how may I help you?
I want to check through to Fez.
But...
you are in Fez, miss.
Hey, little brother,
send him over,
and I'll see to him.
Okay. And how are you?
Good. You go easy
on the mint tea?
Hugs and kisses.
Memories are like knowledge:
It's what's left over
once you forget it all.
And we sure forget things...
we sure forget a lot of things.
Luckily too!
Think about it.
We'd be loaded down.
We have to make some room.
Maybe you've not enough room?
How long have you had blackouts?
I only found out about them
two months ago,
in Paris.
I was driving in circles.
The real problem is when I sing:
I forget the lyrics.
So you sing?
If you can call it that!
I'm kind of reduced
to hotel lounges...
- You sing every night?
- Not only nights!
At noon by the pool,
evenings in the lounge,
and make 'em dance for dinner.
You're singing... around here?
I'm at the Palais Jamai
for a month.
Nice hotel!
Well, I'll come listen to you
sing one of these nights.
Feeling a little better?
Listen, I'll feel better
when the CAT scan is done.
No way it can be done today?
I've got one CAT scan
for the whole district,
so it's a miracle,
it's only because
you're sweet, that I found
an opening tomorrow afternoon.
Don't you worry.
I'm not worried.
You'd never seen
a doctor before now?
My dad used to say:
"An illness will go as it came."
So you don't worry too much,
until tomorrow,
I'll give you these pills.
They're blue like your eyes.
Take 2 on the hour,
and everything'll be fine.
I'll take the sardines.
They're fresh?
Excuse me, sir.
Where may I find a doctor?
- What?
- A doctor.
Go straight through the medina
to the chemist's.
He's a doctor too.
- Thank you, miss.
- You're welcome.
Go straight...
but the other way.
I'm going by the chemist's,
so come along.
First time in Essaouira?
You're lucky,
normally there's this wild wind.
I've a little restaurant
called "Chez Sam."
My husband boxes. World champ!
Hello.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Lamy.
I'm the chemist too.
I prescribe and I sell!
I do both.
Where am I?
You're in Essaouira.
Essaouira in Morocco.
Morocco?
What's going on?
You should be
the one to tell us.
What did you...
what are you doing in Morocco?
I didn't want to come
to Morocco.
That's too bad,
because you're here now.
I'm circling the world
in my boat.
I rammed into a fishing boat...
It's starting to all come back.
I'll send you off
to the Fez Hospital
for an in depth checkup.
Fez! Why Fez?
Because there is no scanner
here. Here, for the brain...
- I need a CAT scan?
- You bet.
And in Fez, the hospital boss
is my twin brother.
And where brains are concerned,
he's a five star doc.
What's wrong with me?
Can't say. With the brain,
it's either all good or all bad.
Maybe you're just exhausted.
But we'd better check you out.
Yes, of course.
With the brain, you never know!
Oh, miss! Forgive me,
and thank you for... for the...
No problem. What's your name?
Valentin.
I mean, your last name?
It's Valentin.
Valentin Valentin.
I was born
on St. Valentine's Day.
We can help you. I can take care
of your boat, with my husband.
Yes, please!
She's called,
"Ladies and Gentlemen."
She's black and white.
No, not black...
I mean blue and white.
- Good-bye and good luck.
- I'll be back... for the ship.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
- I got to go, Sam's waiting.
- Bye, beautiful.
That's a nice name for a ship.
Everybody dreams of sailing
round the world,
especially on one's own.
You are doing it on your own?
Why do it on your own,
like that?
It's my lifetime dream.
Was your wife okay with that?
She... she let you go?
Actually,
my wife's the reason
I'm circling the world.
Okay, I get it now.
I've a wife too,
and sometimes I'd be game
for a world tour.
How long does it take to do it?
Depends... say 4 months.
4 months!
That'd be great, 4 months would.
4 or 5 months'd be
just great, real great.
So?
Well, maybe we'll do
a little physical...
Then call my brother
and tell him the whole works.
Then we'll go have a drink.
Of course. Thanks.
To feel better.
Hugs and kisses.
Can I speak to you?
If you want, later,
when you are done singing,
I'll take you to the medina.
I know someone better
than a doctor.
You're sweet,
but I'd rather wait
for the results first.
You're wrong.
When my men are ill,
she cures them.
Your men! How many've you got?
Four... Three small ones
and one big one.
Is your man handsome?
He's my man.
On this Earth
My only joy
My only happiness
Is my man
I gave all I have
My love and my heart
To my man
Even when I dream at night
It is of him
Of my man
It's not that he's handsome
Nor rich, nor well-built
But I love him, it's crazy...
Sir, sir, you forgot your bag.
If you get out here,
you forgot your bag.
But you have a ticket to Fez,
and this is Douar.
If you want to go to Fez,
it's that way. 159 miles.
Here it's Douar. You, you want
to go to Fez. That way.
Sorry, sir,
I'm foolish these days.
Get in.
Sorry... I'm English!
Excuse me, I'm to see Dr. Lamy,
for a CAT scan.
I'm Dr. Lamy.
You sure are.
Delighted. I am Mr. Valentin.
My brother told me about you.
Follow me, it's down here.
How long have you had blackouts?
2 or 3 months.
But it's never been
so painful before.
Do you have blackouts,
or "black holes"?
Sometimes, it is like
you're talking in the daytime,
but the other person
is in the dead of night?
It's a little like that...
Now and then I see
jewelry stores.
Jewelry stores?
Now that is funny!
I say funny because
I saw a French lady
singing at the Hotel Jamai
who has the same symptoms
as you.
Except that she sees orchestras!
Not really, because I could
kill someone
and not remember doing so.
How long do these blackouts
last? Any idea?
I can't tell you,
because I cannot remember.
Memories are like knowledge:
It's what's left over
once you forget it all.
And we do forget things...
we forget a lot. Luckily too!
Do you think
it might be serious?
Serious?
Only the CAT scan can tell us.
I'm real busy right now,
but I might find an opening
tomorrow afternoon.
Would that be good for you?
I'll give you these pills
in the meantime.
Should I take your luggage, sir?
The same as yesterday, please.
Sure. Right away.
I love your work.
Your husband left?
He's leaving tonight.
At last!
What can I get you?
A glass of water
and a red wine, please.
Good evening.
I've never done this before.
Doctors are for illnesses
that go away on their own.
I really love this medina.
The most beautiful in the world
but don't come alone at night.
Less dangerous than waiting
for the CAT scan.
Ma'am, things never happen
like we thought they should.
Either it's a little better,
or it's a little worse.
Things never quite happen
like we imagine them.
She says she can't cure you,
only make you feel better.
She says
you must go see Lalla Chafia.
Maybe she can cure you.
What do you think it is?
Alzheimer's
or a big brain tumor.
Hot damn! You'd never notice.
Or nothing. With the brain
it's all black or all white.
Or both. Maybe he has both.
Too bad. He has a nice boat.
Have you seen it?
I stared at it all afternoon.
It's just wonderful.
A racing boat. It's...
What?
World champs... world tours!
I say it's touring
around your head a little.
And isn't that
touring you around?
And with this,
I don't have any blackouts.
To see the country
of the calm morning
Go fishing like the cormorant
And get drunk on palm wine...
Doctor, what a pleasure.
Coming for a cocktail.
Please, follow me.
I'll see you for dinner.
We haven't danced
together in ages.
At least you remember.
Do you have to leave tonight?
The sooner I leave,
the sooner I'm back.
With your new plane,
you're always gone.
I promise, as of next week,
I won't leave your side.
- Miss, did you see the singer?
- She went that way.
She's not finished!
Where'd she go?
She had her mike...
What kind of singer is she?
Do you want to see
a Moroccan wedding, miss?
The miss is with me.
I'm not with you.
They say we have the same...
amn... amn... amnesee.
Am-ne-sia.
That's it... amnesia.
Thanks for the applause, before.
Not bad for someone
with blackouts.
Without memories,
everthing's like new.
I see you've thought
about it all.
And now, I'd like you
to forget me.
Are you okay now?
Sure?
Because you're
holding your mike.
Please leave me alone now.
But it's dangerous here.
Please.
Good evening.
And then... he said:
"Seeing as I'm a gentleman,
"let me offer you some
fine Bordeaux.
"You won't die
with a cut throat,
just be dying to sleep."
That's why I couldn't
call out last night.
Besides, I was all tied up
and gagged.
Without madame, who came
to do my room this morning,
you'd still not know.
Miss, just in case,
do not wash the sheets.
Can you describe him at all?
I told you.
He had a hood over his
whole body. Tall... slender...
With a look...
Eyes that I shall never forget.
What language did he
address you in?
Italian, with some kind
of accent.
Wasn't your husband with you?
My husband and I
are touring Morocco.
Now and then
he must go to Rome for work.
So I am sometimes alone
for a day or two.
Normally, in a hotel like this,
one should feel safe!
Who in the hotel
knew you'd be alone last night?
No one! Even I didn't know.
My husband didn't plan to leave.
He took his jet.
It'd take a mountaineer
to scale that.
Or a sailor,
used to scaling the riggings.
Why a sailor?
I know a skipper booked
into the hotel last night.
We've M.O. S here:
Either he came up from below,
or down from above.
Mr. Director, the janitor
found something up on the roof.
Where'd you find this?
There. 5 minutes ago. I was
working on the ventilation...
Where does that door lead to?
To the elevators.
Who is this Mrs. Falconetti?
The wife of Italy's 3rd richest
man, and bored to death.
The despair of the jet set
is fathomless.
Delighted,
but you may speak French.
Sometimes.
Well, there was a major robbery
here last night,
and I wish to ask
a silly question.
Where were you last night
between 3 and 4 am?
Most probably in my room.
Experiencing some blackouts
recently, I can't be sure.
Don't worry, detective,
the gentleman was
with me all night.
Don't tell me
you can't remember that.
How could I forget?
You should've said so.
Sir, I am not crass.
There is a certain natural
elegance to amnesia.
Since you spent
the night together,
sorry for bothering you.
If we spent the night together,
maybe we can have...
breakfast together.
Thanks for the alibi.
I've always favored
robbers over cops,
especially when
they're in distress.
Who says I'm in distress?
Concerning the jewelry theft,
I'm sorry, but it's not me.
Tell the detective, not me.
Really, it's not me.
Really.
One more lie
and I leave the table.
It might just be me... but hush!
Did you really scale
the wall barehanded?
A piece of cake.
Maybe, but I want
all the details.
So,
if we really
spent the night together...
Is this true amnesia,
or are you being courteous?
Help me remember
this unforgettable night.
First, you followed me
into the medina.
Two guys came up and hit on me,
you remember that?
Yes, of course.
You bravely stood up for me.
My assailants
pulled out knives...
Knives?
But you dealt with both of them.
I'd only seen that
in the movies.
I did that?
Really?
Really.
Then, like in the movies,
you kissed me.
Like nobody's ever kissed me.
And then?
Like in a fairy tale,
we made love till dawn.
Isn't that a nice film?
A very nice film.
If it's on tonight,
I'd like to see it again.
It's not nice, toying
with my memories like that.
You can toy
with my memories too.
But when?
One day, maybe.
Shit!
It's time for our pills.
Aren't you taking yours?
Why not?
No reason.
Are you still going
to have the CAT scan?
I don't think I'll go.
Why not?
Last night I met a strange woman
who told me strange things.
Now I feel like I'm better.
The doctor had no right
telling you about me.
Seriously,
last night, were we together?
Maybe.
Tell me the truth.
I hope you stole the jewels,
'cause I can no longer
stand normal people.
Do you speak English?
When I want to.
What do you do,
besides stealing?
I'm a thief.
Luckily it wasn't you.
It'd be best
if we left together.
Follow me to the lobby.
Let's go.
Look at that man leaving.
That guy?
He was staring at me
in the bar last night, smiling.
You know him?
He's a skipper.
Got here yesterday.
You questioned him?
He has an alibi:
Spent all night with the singer.
All this makes me think
that my barman, it can't be him,
but he's from the Alps.
A true mountaineer.
I'm sorry you had to rush back,
that you had to fly back.
Great move you made: 2 million
dollars! Congratulations.
Go on, tell me
what you said earlier.
In the bar, last night,
the man was eyeing
the Italian lady and her jewels.
That's what jewels are made for.
To be admired.
You speak Italian too?
The manager said
you were from the Alps.
People are good at climbing
in the Alps.
If I was a good climber,
I wouldn't be a barman.
Last night,
between 3 and 4 am, of course,
you'll say you were in your bed?
Not really.
Where were you?
In the bed of a pretty woman.
Who is she?
The front desk girl.
Mind if I check?
You can check.
Well, I don't check alibis
anymore.
Only the innocent
don't have alibis.
You're driving towards a legend.
Lalla Chafia is no more real
than Santa Claus.
To get the best chances
on their side,
some walk from Fez barefoot!
And reach her bleeding!
How many kilometers away are we?
Not many... 29, 26...
29, 26...
Listen, let us out here.
We'll walk what's left.
Are you serious?
Are we serious?
Who can resist a legend?
The legend says
you must take the track
that Lalla Chafia walked.
You're welcome.
Over here.
Are you sure?
Still time for regrets.
19 kilometers up that way
there's a village.
Stop for a drink.
It's hot.
Hi, kids! Hello, princess!
Howdy, tourists! Hi, Roger.
- Hi, Sunshine.
- Hi, Boubou.
You staying for dinner?
No, I gotta get back to Fez.
Where's the champ?
Over there.
Quite the sour puss...
What's wrong?
They pushed
the Vegas World Title back.
No shit? Oh, damn!
- Testing my nerves.
- I'd booked the tickets...
What's the handyman
to be handy at?
Everything that my husband
won't do anymore.
Is there a lot he won't do?
Yes, or else we'd
have found someone.
How did you end up in Morocco?
I came to forget.
Funny for an amnesiac, ain't it?
The front desk girl was adamant.
They asked for a cab to drive
them to Lalla Chafia's grave.
You been up there, detective?
3 years ago,
when my wife was ill.
Did it work?
Unfortunately.
How do you climb up there?
In the morning, you go
to the baths to be purified.
Then, at high noon,
when it's real hot,
you climb up
to Lalla Chafia's grave,
ask for your wish,
and come back down.
We've no proof yet
that it's the skipper.
With the sheet
the English sent us,
it'd be a coincidence
if it weren't him.
See his London score in '98?
Good-bye, Mr. Hitchcock.
A very beautiful copy.
I don't see the point
of all that.
One month,
just the time I needed
to make the copy I sold him.
You're beginning to scare me.
It's not my fault if our world
has more buyers than experts.
Don't be amazed
if you have headaches.
Where do your headaches
come from?
In love stories too, there are
more buyers than experts.
What if the miracle was to work
on just one of us?
Whatever may happen,
I'll keep believing
that whatever happens
is for the best.
Even having such headaches?
Otherwise we wouldn't have met.
You think that's for the best?
If you see Mr. Valentin Valentin
or Jane Lester,
call the Fez police. Thank you.
What if they followed
the legend
and are going to see Lalla
Chafia by walking from Fez?
They'd still be on the track.
Let's drive back that way.
Anyone here?
Sir!
You know,
if we had our CAT scans
we'd know by now.
If someone gave you an envelope,
stating the day of your death,
would you open it?
Is that what made you set off
towards Lalla Chafia?
What made you follow me?
I thought you were unique,
but you're 2, like everyone.
I plead guilty.
What do you blame your wife for?
Only what I'd like
to blame you for, one day.
Meaning?
Nothing.
It's only time that's to blame.
And there's no other way?
To split up early enough,
or to die early enough.
With time
With time all fades away
One forgets the face,
One forgets the voice
When the heart beats no longer
No point in searching
any further
Just let go and it's all right.
With time
With time all fades away
One forgets the face,

To Lalla Chafia!
Are you okay?
How can donkeys see at night?
Very good question.
Do you remember me?
I don't like it at night.
I don't either.
Take a drink.
Not to worry...
Take half a drink.
Feeling better?
How long did it last?
3 minutes. Just the time it took
to go from here to there.
Want me to call a cab?
I just want a drink of water,
then let's get going.
Hello, Sir.
Hello.
This morning
I found out a lot about you.
What would you do in my shoes?
How many times must I say
he spent the night with me?
Dear madam,
a fantasy is no alibi.
Leave her out of this.
I'll go with you.
You're arresting him?
No, I'm only going to ask
some questions.
Please come by the precinct
and sign your statement.
Thanks, ma'am.
Ask Lalla Chafia
to find the true culprit.
Please, sir.
Don't make Lalla Chafia wait.
Wait!
You forgot this.
What is it?
The healer-lady gave it to me.
It went so fast...
It went so fast...
It's hard to be sure,
and it was dark.
Don't worry, you're safe now.
Take your hood off, please.
Thank you.
Have you seen this man before?
Last night in the bar.
I think... I think I saw him.
Do you reiterate
this morning's proposal?
Totally.
These ladies and gentlemen
are generous,
so hand the jewels back
and the charges will be dropped,
and the Moroccan police
will even forget you exist.
I'll go further.
I officially offer $199,999
to anyone who finds the jewels.
And that's good for you too!
These ladies and gentlemen
will remain in Fez awhile,
so I hope you get your memory
back real fast.
It can't be him.
No, it's not him.
Thank you, ma'am.
I knew it wasn't him.
In 2 years, we've only
gotten compliments.
If it's not him,
it's elementary,
it's the other one.
If I don't see a doctor
right away, my head'll burst.
Give me the jewels, and I'll
drive you to the hospital.
But with all the blackouts...
Every time I arrest someone...
he's either innocent,
amnesiac or an orphan.
He'll confirm everything.
You remember seeing a doctor,
seems like
it's starting to come back.
I have all the time
in the world.
We have all the time
in the world.
With time
With time all fades away
With time...
May I sit down?
Of course...
as soon as I know
where the jewels are.
Over 2 million dollars
in jewels
have just been stolen
at the Sofitel's Hotel Jamai in
Fez, from Contessa Falconetti,
the wife
of the famed couturier.
What's this necklace?
You don't like it anymore?
I do...
Can you climb that well?
You want it to be me?
The first suspects
have been cleared,
except for Valentin Valentin,
a skipper with a strange
amnesia and a shady past
who was cat-napping
at the Hotel Jamai in Fez.
I did say cat-napping
because only a spider or a cat
could scale such a smooth wall.
What the...?
I just spoke to him on his ship.
His trip's nothing but an alibi.
He's real slick.
I can see how he seduced you.
I knew he wasn't a dreamboat...
but this!
The Turkish tanker, the donkeys
and whales... I should've known.
You still love him?
What?
You still love him?
I still believed in us.
He's real slick.
Please, miss.
I'd like to speak with
the Moroccan embassy.
The Moroccan embassy, please.
I can rent a plane and fly you.
Shit... disconnected.
Tell me where the jewels are
and you can sit.
The Moroccan embassy in Morocco.
Not the Moroccan embassy
in Paris...
the Moroccan embassy in Morocco.
There is no Moroccan embassy
in Morocco.
Embassies are
in other countries.
No one finds this amusing.
Don't you want to speak?
Yes, he often steals.
What? Often? What the...?
Of course he does it often,
it's his job.
What do you mean often?
Nobody. I was joking!
Very funny.
It's just that, I don't think
he needs you right away,
just now.
How long were you together?
We're still together.
We're all together, then!
If you want, we're all together.
And then,
later on, we're going to eat,
and we're going to sleep.
Yes, we'll sleep
right in front of you.
I know the timing's
not that great,
but...
I'm really in love with you,
so...
So I'm telling you now.
You aren't laughing.
Just a little bit?
What do we do about Valentin?
It's so nice to lie down.
You'll see,
it's hardest around 4 or 5 am.
Around sunrise... there aren't
many who can take it.
You don't like it?
Did you sell this
to the hotel barman?
Of course.
It's fine. I'll keep it.
Sixteen hours standing up.
A record!
If you'd told me
where the jewels are,
you'd be with your girlfriend
climbing to Lalla Chafia.
Put yourself in our shoes.
Listen,
it's a hell of a coincidence
that those jewels
and a man like you met.
You were made for one another.
So, for the last time,
tell me where the jewels are...
It's gone,
she's raising the sail
Any way the wind blows
You only have one star
You have to follow it
all the time
Do you remember me?
So, Lalla Chafia?
I can't believe it!
Another dream
I'd like to share with you.
How is Jane?
If you tell me
where the jewels are,
we'll go see her together.
Did you call Dr. Lamy?
That guy's fishy.
First up, and last to bed...
Kind to everyone...
If you can't even trust good
people! For once we found one.
He works as though
he's the boss.
Maybe he loves the area.
Maybe you're the area.
You know they all love me
in the area.
If he doesn't screw up
in a day or 2, he's out.
Never happy.
One wrong step, and I pop you.
We know you didn't spend
the night together.
The doorman saw you return
around 5 am... alone.
What if I did the robbery?
Here's his past.
I'm only interested
in his future.
You want to read his statement?
Here.
Question:
"Did you spend the night
"with Miss Jane Lester,
in her room at the Hotel Jamai?"
Answer: "No."
Which proves he's a gentleman.
Can I see him?
Once we find the jewels.
Is he in pain?
Have you known him long?
Two days.
Do you like Morocco?
If you let me see him, yes.
What are you doing at our place?
I'm planning a robbery.
We've nothing to rob.
There is.
You!
At first I just wanted
to lay low awhile.
And then... there was you.
- Hi, Mom.
- How's my princess?
Hey, Mom.
- What're you doing?
- Shopping with David.
Let's go okay. Let's go.
How's my handyman?
He's too handy.
The other day,
he went shopping,
so I tossed his room.
You went through his stuff?
What'd you find?
Passports, credit cards
and jewels.
Oh, damn!
I'd like you to be here tomorrow
while I'm sparring.
No sweat.
What am I to do?
For a few days now when I
spar... no Sunshine!
Maybe you're a little paranoid,
because, hey, bud,
If I were him, and I came here,
you're a boxer,
I don't want you popping me
if I hit on your wife.
I'm saying
I find this hard to believe.
Maybe he's a cool guy.
Did you speak to the police?
A little.
No, it's not him.
Maybe it's not him,
but it's still him.
He is the handyman specialist.
Ouarzazate,
Marrakech, Rabat...
2 weeks here, 3 months there.
He finds a job, works day
and night, becomes trustworthy,
gets the shop keys...
and empties the place.
The one who looks the best
is the Englishman.
With a tumor like that, it's a
miracle he remembers his name.
He could've done it
and not remembered.
- What's your advice?
- Operate.
Right away.
Not a minute to lose.
Afterwards, will he remember?
What'll you do with the jewels,
if you can't be operated on?
Right now they're my only
bargaining chips.
After the operation,
I'll tell you where they are.
So it is you.
Yes, it is me.
I'm sorry.
Does the singer have
the same thing?
She chose
to go see Lalla Chafia.
That's okay by me!
What are my chances?
A slim one...
out of ten!
You see
I haven't forgotten
The song you sang to me...
The wind tonight is
unbelievable.
Haven't we already
seen that guy?
Which guy?
The one sitting by himself
in the back.
No, his face
doesn't ring a bell.
I think we have.
I remember, now.
He was in Mogador.
And Rabat... and Marrakech too.
Hello, Detective. It's Jane.
I have information for you.
And I have some for you too.
Valentin confessed.
The operation's tomorrow.
- It went wrong?
- No! That's someone else.
But they're pretty close...
Can I see him?
We can see him sleep,
but he'll be in a coma awhile.
He's got a chance of making it?
Only if he's friends
with his Maker.
It was Valentin who stole
the jewels. He confessed.
Bad news is,
he can't recall where they are.
He's in surgery, and there's
a 99% chance he won't wake up.
You're sure
the insurance won't pay up?
I told you to put the damn
jewels in the hotel safe!
Then we'd have been insured.
I'm sorry,
I was too tired to go down.
Not too tired
for a bottle of Bordeaux.
You must've been stinking drunk!
You really are a pain.
Where are you going?
To get the plane. We're going.
And screw you.
She's there.
He's here.
I'm sure it's him.
What makes you say that?
I do his room every day.
It's no bachelor's room,
and the sheets, they smell
of Mrs. Falconetti's perfume.
And a taxi too, please.
Thank you.
- Send my bags down, please?
- Of course.
Thanks for everything.
Thanks sir.
Mouna, he's coming.
Delay him as best you can,
I'll hurry.
Sorry, our computer broke down.
Did the luggage-boy
break down too?
It's prayer time,
even for the boys.
I'm telling you,
if I miss this plane...
You'll take the next one!
What?
You'll take the next one,
in 5 or 6 years.
What's going on?
The maid just found the jewels
in your bags.
Mrs. Falconetti gave them to me.
At knifepoint?
She's my mistress.
She can give me gifts.
Want me to say
how many mistresses
you've had in 29 years?
In 29 years, you never gave me
a $2 million gift.
Madame, please!
It would be good of you
to delay your trip.
Mrs. Falconetti,
for the umpteenth time,
you won't leave the country
until you admit
that you committed the robbery
to pay your lover's debts,
his many debts.
- Thank you, sir.
- I like it.
But if you can play further
away, I'd be happy.
If I go away, you'll regret it.
How come?
Because I have jewels for you.
Very kind,
but we have enough already.
Thank you, sir, very kind.
So, please...
Hello.
Where are you?
In Paris.
How are you?
Well, like after a miracle.
And you?
Like after an operation.
And you, where are you?
At the start
of the Race of Races.
I came to see
my friend Thierry off.
His ship is sailing out now.
Can't you hear
the crowd cheering?
I hear. I even see...
I mean, I can nearly see them.
What're you doing in Paris?
I'm singing in a jazz club.
I'll think of you...
A Ionely bird on the ocean
Takes itself for a boat
She looks back
Says bye-bye to Johnny Doe.
It's gone,
she's raising the sail
Any way the wind blows
You only have one star
You have to follow it
all the time
Let the show begin
With a story of a piano bar
Which was down on its luck,
Didn't know what to make of
the girl who sang of her life
A star...
Will he be on time?
Dark thief...
It's nothing
if he never sees the leaf...
Give up the fight
"Life is a deep sleep
"of which love is the dream."
Do you remember me?
If all goes well,
in 3 or 4 weeks,
you can sail out to sea again.
Where are we off to, skipper?
If I wish to pay everyone back,
we'll have to sail
around the world.
Okay?
