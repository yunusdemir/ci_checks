Sorry.
No chocolate macadamia.
You would please
have something else?

That will be $ 1 .08.
That sign says
''All Coffee 69 Cents.''
I am very sorry,
but that is a 44-ounce cup,
and the largest
coffee cup is 20 ounces.
Therefore,
I must charge you...
99 "cents", "plus tax--"
the price of
a large fountain drink.
That's bullshit. That sign says
''Coffee All Sizes,''
not ''All Sizes
Up to 20 Ounces.''
I am humbly sorry,
but you must pay
99 cents plus tax...
for that cup.
Just pay
the bitch the $ 1 .08...
and let's get the
fuck out of here.
All right.
This is bullshit. just give me
my fuckin Snackie Cake.
I am sorry.
I cannot do that.
<i>That is only available...</i>
with the 20-ounce coffee.
That is not a 20-ounce coffee.
This bitch is gettin'
on my nerves, man. Forget it.
-Just give him the fuckin' danish.
- That sign says...
<i>''Free Snackie Cake. ''</i>
<i>I paid $ 1.08 for my coffee.</i>
<i>I want my free Snackie Cake.</i>
I cannot do that.
Here. take it.
That's apple cinnamon.
I wanted cream cheese.
Fuck's sake. Pay her
the money and let's go.
Either of you got
something smaller than a Ben?
I'm sorry.
I cannot accept
any monies over a $20 bill.
- That's it.

Look, uh, I'm coming through

I was wondering
if I might come see you.
Oh, I don't know, bro. Why?
Things have changed.
I'm getting married.
I was hoping I could stay
a couple days, you know?
Catch up?
[ "Birds Chirping ]"

''Sorry, bro, my wife's...
''going to be a little tired

''Here's 20 bucks.
There's a La Quinta

I told you.

I'm going to miss my plane.
I got to go. Bye.
- "What about breakfast?"
- No. sorry. No time.
Okay--
Chris, don't plan anything
tomorrow night. It's opening night.

with Allen tomorrow night.
Why didn't you remind me?
Chris, i've been working
on this club for eight months.
He's the C.E.O.

We can't miss it.
We'll work something out.

This isn't exactly how
I envisioned our reunion going.
[ Grunts, Laughs ]
Oh, God... damn!
You had me going.

Come on.
Finally, I ended up in Texas.
That was about a year ago.
I had a little money,
got into mineral leases,
And I've been, uh...
working between

Looks like we both escaped.

You look like that wolf

I can't imagine why.
Well, you're kind of a dick,

I'm sorry.
I guess I just haven't
acclimatized yet.
I was in L.A.
Los Angeles? Oh.
Took some time off.
You know, for six weeks
you come in here...
every night--
alone, I might add--
and you sit here,
and you study for hours.
And every night I wait on you,
and you don't even notice me.
How come?
It's not that I--
I mean, I noticed.
I mean, you-- You're--
- Fuck, I'm just trying
to get through this.
- So, here it is,
Friday night, and here you sit.
And I'm thinking either, one:
You know, you're just a total geek.
Or, two: you don't have any friends.
And you don't
look like a geek, so, uh...
I was wondering
if you'd like to go...
uh, get some breakfast?
You don't even know me.
Oh. uh... I'm Christine.
- "You are?"
- Casey.
Casey. Casey. Okay, good.
Wait.
What?
Tell me, why is it
so fucking difficult?
What?
This relationship.
Why is it so... difficult?
<i>I'm busting my ass here...</i>
"to be the perfect husband for you",
<i>"and the harder I work",</i>
<i>the less you care.</i>
I love you, and...
you care more about
your career than you care about me.
Casey, I do love you...
but you are boring
the shit out of me.
You are working so fucking hard
to be what you think I want...
instead of giving me what I need.
<i>Quit trying so hard.</i>
<i>Why don't you just be yourself?</i>
I don't want
Fred MacMurray, Casey.
I want you.
You, the cocky,
determined guy, full of life.
-"Full of--"
- You wouldn't like who I am.
I married you!
<i>I love you.</i>
I don't want
to lose you, Christine.
<i>Christine!</i>
There is nothing in that case
but a pack of legal documents.
Maybe a box of condoms.
That's it.
[ "Phone Ringing" ]
Yeah?
I just want to know one thing.
What kind
of fucking drugs are you on?
What?
I want to know what kind
of "fucking drugs" you were on...
to make you think you could
bring fucking smack into my house!
- That briefcase was locked, Case.
- Yeah? Sue me!
That wasn't very trusting
of you to go through my shit.
This ain't exactly me borrowing
your trading cards here, Beave.
You brought shit into my house!
Into my home!
Which I invited you
into as my fucking guest!
You know what they did
in ancient Rome...
when a visitor violated
somebody's hospitality?
They cut off his dick and they
nailed it to the fucking gate!
See, this is why
I didn't want to tell you.
I knew that you would have very
little enthusiasm for this deal.
I had a little business
to finish up in Houston,
and I wanted to tell you
"adios" face to face.
I want you to pedal your ass
back here, pick up your shit...
get the fuck out of my house.
No can do, buddy.
I appreciate your situation,
but I told you...
I got a little unfinished
business to take care of.
- So what?
- A little unfinished business.
If you're not
back here in 1 5 minutes,
you're going to have
to pick up your shit
from the police evidence room.
And tell 'em what?
Your ex-partner
just happened to stop by...
with a basketful of goodies...
and you felt it was
your moral obligation
to turn him in?
- I don't think so.
- Look, you lame piece of shit.
I am having
a little bit of trouble...
coming up with reasons not to blow
the back of your fucking head off!
You're not sounding like
that happy little suburbanite
I saw this morning.
Don't forget.
Never can tell who's listening in.
Just watch my shit, Case.
I'll be back in a couple of hours,
I'll pick up
my bags and I'll split.

Hello.
Mr. Wells.
Dr.Jarvis, so good
to see you again.
Nice to see you, too.
Won't you come in?
Sorry about that.
I-I couldn't find
the key to the door.
- I didn't hear it unlock.
- Oh, that's right.
I didn't find it.
Um, right this way.
So, Mr. Wells, you and your wife...
would like to adopt the baby.
- Yes, sir. that's right.
- Okay.
Now, you understand the next step
in the adoption proceedings?
Um, yes. We are to be
individually evaluated.
Yes. that's right.
That's why I'm here.
Uh, your wife, of course,
has already completed
her evaluation.
She's an extraordinary woman.
<i>Absolutely extraordinary woman.</i>
- Um, shall we begin?
- Sure. yeah. One thing--
<i>Weren't we already evaluated</i>
<i>at the previous screening?</i>
No. that was just
the initial consultation.
<i>This is the individual</i>
<i>competency test.</i>
Do you have a problem
with that, Mr. Wells?
No... not really.
Good. Then we can get started.
And what are your
qualifications, Dr.Jarvis?
"Are you an M.D.", "uh--"
Are you nervous, Mr. Wells?
No.
Why?
Because what you're doing
is this thing...
called conversational
transference.
<i>Simply means</i>
<i>that you're trying to evade...</i>
<i>answering my question</i>
<i>"by answering me" with "questions."</i>
<i>It's something that's</i>
<i>usually indulged in...</i>
by individuals
who are trying to hide something.
You trying to hide
something from me, Mr. Wells?
- No.
- "Good."
- Do you currently use drugs?
- No.
Not even Tylenol?
Some... sure.
- Any history of drug use?
- Uh...
A little, I guess.
About as much as anyone
who goes to college.
''Justification of drug use.''
<i>How about alcohol?</i>
An occasional beer.
You ever been incarcerated
or institutionalized?
- No.
- "Any history of mental illness?"
- No.
- You know, there's something
about your application...
that's very troubling to me.
There's a gap of two,
two and a half years.
I mean--
- "It occurs", "like", "five years ago."
- Yeah.
Can I get you,
uh, some iced tea?
- No. No, thank you.
- I'm a little dry.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no. please, go.
Go right ahead.
<i>I asked because</i>
<i>your wife was very vague...</i>
<i>about what you might</i>
<i>have been doing...</i>
<i>and I was hoping</i>
<i>you might be able...</i>
to shed a little bit
of light on it for me.
Uh, I was in L.A.
Yes. that's just
what your wife said.
Could you be a little bit
more specific, though?
Oh, well...
I-I was doing some odd jobs...
"and this and that", "you know?"
"No", "I" don't "know."
<i>Could you elaborate?</i>
Well, I did work
as a mechanic for a while.
Oh, you mean like
for a body shop?
No. I mean like
in a performance shop.
- Perf--
- Well, exotics and, uh, rally cars.
Oh. Uh-huh.
You know, I've changed my mind.
I think I would
like some iced tea.
I'm sorry.
We're all out of iced tea.
How about a beer?
Yeah--
- You don't have anything else?
- No.
No. I don't.
This is-- This is just about
all that-- all that I have.
Chris has been a little busy.
I'm-I'm sorry, Dr.Jarvis.
What-What were you saying?
Oh, I was just asking
if you remember the name
of that performance shop.
Uh, Bubba's.
''Bubba's''?

Do you have
a number for Bubba's?

- [ "Banging" ]
- My cat... must have got in--
got into the garage...

I can do with these?
- Mm-hmm.
- Somehow, I just don't believe you.
Besides, that'd just
make a lot of noise.

- Some bitch named Dallas.

- You think so?
- Absolutely.
- Do you like pornos?
- Excuse me?

Surely you've heard stories.
Yes. I've heard stories,
but I've never-- never really
given them that much thought.
I love them,
especially fag flicks.
<i>Their big cocks sliding in</i>
<i>and out of each other.</i>
Fuck, that gets me so wet
they have to steam clean
the seat after I leave.
In fact,
<i>[ Moans ]</i>
I'm getting wet

- What aren't you telling me, Nick?
- Nothing, Case.
-Just don't give her my shit.
- Don't worry. I don't have it.
- You give it to the Jamaican?
- No.
- I flushed it down the sink.
- What?
I went on as a day player
on this porn film in L.A.
Just to see
what it was like, right?
So, I spent five hours with this guy
ramming his dick up my ass...
and these two women
licking my clit.
<i>"Not what you'd expect",</i>
<i>though. It's just acting.</i>
I mean, at first, it was great.
Then you have some prick director
that comes over and yells
''cut'' in your face...
<i>and some queen makeup artist</i>
<i>that comes over every</i>
<i>couple of minutes...</i>
to touch up the makeup that's
been slobbered off your tits.
<i>So you don't really</i>
<i>have a chance to enjoy it.</i>
Finally, I just walked off the set.

Is that how you answer
the phone these days?
I'm sorry, honey.
I thought you were somebody else.
- Did you know Mr. Wells
when he was living in L.A.?
- Well, not directly.
Course,
I heard of his work.
His work?
Isn't that why you're here?
What do you need?
I mean, how's your day going?
Tough. We're at
an impasse on the fee, so...
That's great, honey.
What?
Casey, are you okay?
How's everything there?
Oh, it's interesting.
You really wouldn't believe it.
Have you seen Dr.Jarvis?
- Yes, and he's here right now.
- Really?
- How's it going?
- Huh--
And then, once I met Nick,
I got the full-blown
Casey Wells story.
- You want one?
- One what?
A Casey Wells story.
- Yes, I would.
- How about the last one?
- Fine.
- "All right."
Nick and Casey...
"Had this guy", "Jimmy."
"A small-time nothing",
<i>a bird dog for some</i>
<i>of the mid-level players.</i>
It's cool, man.
You just took too big a lick.
- "[ Laughing ]"
- That is some rank
fuckin' shit, man.
<i>And he set up</i>
<i>a meeting between them...</i>
and this big nigger
named... uh, Lester James.
<i>Of</i>
<i>"course", "most people"</i>
<i>knew him as ''Ballpeen. ''</i>
- Ballpeen's casa at 7:00.
- Where in the fuck a nigger
get a name like that?
- You seen
little nigger's arm, right?
- "[ Casey ] Oh", "yeah."
- That's why they
call him Ballpeen.
- He broke Jimmy's arm--
with a ten-pound
ball peen hammer.
<i>Three years ago</i>
<i>"LesterJames", "a.k.a. Ballpeen",</i>
"was a big", "stud motherfucker."
Had a stable of bitches
he fucked on a regular basis,
but every couple weeks...
he went out to get some strange.
"One night", "Lester finds"
"himself in this titty bar",
and this knockout white girl
named Raven is just gyrating
her little tits off.
<i>"Well", "Lester wanted her"</i>
<i>in the worst way.</i>
Even more when she told him
to go fuck himself.
<i>He sprinkles</i>
<i>a little fairy dust on her...</i>
<i>somehow gets</i>
<i>her to go back to his place.</i>
That was all she wrote.
He "abused" this bitch.
<i>He fucked her every way</i>
<i>you can think of and then some.</i>
Finally, he gets ready
to go again, and he figures...
he'd "really" degrade this bitch
and make her blow him.
So, he pushes
her head down and, bam!
She bites that
motherfucker's dick... clean off.
<i>"Fortunately", "they found it"</i>
<i>and sewed it back on.</i>
But it never worked right again.
[ Sniffles ]
The problem is,
a story like that gets around,
you know how it is.
<i>"So to combat this",</i>
<i>anytime he even heard</i>
<i>"anybody talk about it",</i>
he'd use this
fuckin' hammer on them.
''Ballpeen'' kind of stuck.
- And Jimmy?
- Over the years, this kind
of shit gets out of control.
"So one day", "Ballpeen"
"is late for a meeting",
and Jimmy made the mistake
of asking if he'd been jerking off.
Next thing you know,
Jimmy's got a broken arm.
Goddamn.
<i>[ Dallas ]</i>
<i>Fast-forward to Ballpeen's.</i>
<i>Just another drug deal...</i>
- "in La-La Land."
- Motherfuckers team
make it out here?
- Want to get this over with.
- "[ Car Alarms Chirping ]"
Shit makes me nervous.
What the fuck
is up with this shit?
You must have
some pretty bad fuckin' karma...
feel the need
for that kind of artillery.
Don't worry, babe.
It's cool.
Casey. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, man!
Fuck you! You in my
motherfuckin' house!
Now, come on,
big black man.
You know I wouldn't
bring no niggas up in here
unless they was cool.
<i>[ Deep Male Voice ]</i>
<i>Let that bad motherfucker in.</i>
- How's that arm, nigga?
- It's all right.
- It's still here.
- "You a bad motherfucker?"
I just don't let people
run their hands all over me.
It shows a lack of trust.
- May I sit down?
- Are you here to sit?
<i>[ Casey ]</i>
<i>You tell me.</i>
Sit down.
- Shit looks good.
- Your turn.
Why don't you show us
the money now?
Why don't you, uh. let me
choose the next kilo to test?
Help yourself.
[ Snaps Fingers ]
Derrick.
Count 'em,Jimmy.
Some more, square?
Since we're all good friends here,
I got a question for you.
Ask away.
It's all here, Case.
I heard about
this big, bad motherfucker.
He's got this habit
of hitting niggers with his hammer.
<i>I've heard the reason</i>
<i>why he uses it...</i>
and I can sympathize.
But, uh...
there's this one thing...
that I just-- I can't
get it out of my head.
- Go on.
- "Well..."
I heard about how
most niggers got these
really big dicks, you know.
I mean...
just salami-sized cocks.
<i>Well...</i>
Now, I've had many
a different blow job...
by any number
of different bitches.
<i>"So", "I know how much room"</i>
<i>even my white-boy dick...</i>
takes up
in a bitch's mouth, right.
My question...
is how the hell
this little bitch...
got this big,
nigger dick in her mouth...
chomped it off
all in one bite?
<i>She could have gnawed</i>
<i>"on it for a while",</i>
but I don't think
there's a motherfucker
in here let that happen.
<i>- Yo, we got a problem here.</i>
<i>- "So", "the only thing"</i>
<i>I can think of...</i>
is that this big, bad
ass-kickin' nigger...
"had this little", "itty-bitty dick..."
<i>wouldn't have</i>
<i>"done him no good", "anyway."</i>
What do you think?
Am I close?
<i>"[ Derrick ] I said", "we got"</i>
<i>a motherfuckin'problem here!</i>
What you doing, man?
I'm fuckin' dead.
- "Fuckin'dead."
- Why didn't you use
a silencer, Casey?
"Get the fuckin'money", "Jimmy."
<i>I'm fuckin'dead.</i>
<i>"I'm fuckin'dead", "man."</i>
Why didn't you use
a silencer, Casey?
You want to go door-to-door--
tell everybody my fuckin' name?
- Oh! I'm fuckin', fuckin' dead.
- Fuckin' forgot 'em.
<i>"[ Nick ] Good luck", "man."</i>
<i>I don't know what the fuck</i>
<i>is wrong with you.</i>
We got 45 seconds.
Let's go.
[ "Gunshot" ]
You still here?
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
I've heard quite
enough for one day.
What-- What?
What did you tell him?
- "I don't even know this bitch."
- Well, she certainly
seems to know you.
Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure to meet you.
Could have made
a very bad mistake.
Dr.Jarvis.
Now, I-- I--
- Doctor!
- We'll be in touch, Mr. Wells.
No, now, there's been some kind
of a mistake, Dr.Jarvis.
Dr.Jarvis!
- I'm fucked.
- Yes... you are.
"Well", "Case", "it's just you and I."
What do you think?
My wife's going to have my ass
when she finds out I let...
some dyke in a pink rubber dress
blow off her chances...
for Happy Meals
and diaper wipes.
It's red, asshole.
- Where is it?
- I'll tell you, if you
answer one question.
Sure. Shoot.
Are you on the rag?
Because you look like
one of those women who are...
explosive under stressful
situations, and--
Being married, you should
fucking know how much women
hate that question.
But being a typical male,
you ignore
your better judgment...
and ask anyway, huh?
I should just do your wife
a favor and blow your head off.
It's as if every mood swing
can be written off as...
''She's just on the rag.''
<i>Like that explains something.</i>
Women have mood shifts,
that "is" a fact of life.
"And for your information",
"I am a complete bitch",
whether I'm on the rag or not.
Hmm?
Now, let me answer
your question.
- Does that answer it?
- I'd say you're right.
You're just a bitch.
Good.
Now...
answer my questions...
- before you start
losing appendages.
- [ Grunts ]
It's gone.
- Gone?
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, it's gone?
- I 86'ed it.
I sent it
swimming down the sink.
- Bye-bye.
- You're one smooth
motherfucker, Casey.
You can keep the smack,
and I'll take the money,
- And we can call it even.
- Money? What fucking money?
It seems we're going around
in circles here. Hmm.
"I want the two mil", "Casey."
- Let me--
- Let me explain something to you.
I am not a drug dealer.
It's been four years...
since I've even seen any drugs.
I'm an architect.
[ Laughing ]
I am a happy little Republican...
who spends
the majority of his time...
trying to figure out
how to pay the fucking bills...
and make his wife happy.
I got to tell you, Casey,
I'm not impressed.
After everything
I heard about you...
I thought you were
gonna be more like... me.
But you are a sheep
like all the rest.
There will come a time...
when even you
can't handle it anymore.
You'll pack it up
or you'll put a bullet...
in that pretty
little head of yours.
Or someone else will.
You are a pussy, Casey.
Nick wouldn't admit
it, but it's true.
You just couldn't
handle it, could you?
Nick ever tell you
about that last time?
Sure. Ballpeen's apartment?
- Uh-huh.
- Did he tell you about the girl?
- What's up?
- Why didn't you use
the silencer, Casey?
Get the fucking money.
- Why didn't you use a silencer?
- You wanna go door to door...
<i>and tell everybody</i>
<i>in the building my fuckin'name?</i>
- "I forgot 'em", "all right?"
- I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with you.
Get the fuckin' money,Jimmy,
and let's get the fuck out.
We got 45 seconds.
Let's go.
- What?
-Jesus.
She's seven,
maybe eight months, pregnant, Nick.
Fuck me.
"Come on", "Casey", "we got to go."
She's dead, Casey.
Dead, just like we're going to be...
if we don't move our asses.
We got to go.
Snap out of it, man!
It's clear. We got to jump.
That bitch was gonna
kill you, man. Let it go.
- What about Jimmy? Is he--
- He's meat loaf, bro.
This is it, Nick.
No more.
That was it.
Oh, that was a real
touching story, Case.
Remind me to submit it
to "Reader's Digest"
after you're gone.
So it looks like we're
going to have to wait for Nick.
<i>What should we do</i>
<i>to kill some time?</i>
I know.
- Let's fuck.
- That's happening.
Even if you weren't the most
disgusting bitch I'd ever met,
I'd have to decline.
You see, I'm a married man.
You seem to be under the impression
that you have a choice here.
Ah, let's see.
You'll appreciate the irony here.

Ordinarily, it would be a damn shame
to shoot a piece of ass like that.

I'll make an exception.

they scoop off the top layer.
That's mescal.
Nasty, huh?
<i>No wonder that shit</i>

you're going to be dead

Why don't we...
handle our business like

<i>in the process.</i>

Okay?
But we want our money back.

come through here--

you spent with Nicky...

- I know how much you're doing

And I venture to guess that--
that your good-looking wife
doesn't even know about your past.
<i>Right?</i>
Tell you what, Casey,
I want to make you a deal.
You have that money
here tonight at 7:00,
And I'll make this fuckin'

- In the garage.

- I didn't know
what to do with them.

going to come home and
she's not going to be very happy.
Any suggestions?
Well, I'll tell you,
if, uh, I'm not mistaken...
I think today's garbage day.
7:00.
