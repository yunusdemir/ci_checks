There's never a cop around
when you need one.
How much?
Can't say I'm crazy about the paint job.
How long to get an order
from the factory?
AII right, how much you give me
in trade for my Ford?
ReaIIy? Thanks a Iot,
you cheating bastard.
Great show. HeId over
for a third straight year.
Marijuana!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please weIcome warmly. . .

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
We're certainly deIighted
to be here today.
We'd like to start oft
our portion of the show. . .
...by giving you a taste of a littIe something
we call rock 'n' soul music.
This is realIy beautifuI, man.
You know, Iike ,
you have to realize the turnabout...
. . .that l've gone through
in the last three days.
Just to look, just to see ,
just to really realize.. .
. . .what's really important.
The fact that if we can't
all live together and be happy. . .
...if you have to be afraid
to walk out in the street...
...if you have to be afraid
to smile at somebody, right?
What kind of a way is that
to go through this Iife?
No. They sure don't make pictures
like that anymore.
There is no phone ringing, damn it!
There is no phone.
My God' it's almost dark.
They'll be waking up soon.
Penthouse, Robert, and hurry.
Oui , oui, sir .
This is your commentator,
Jonathan Matthias, with another bulIetin.
And now, as the Sino-Russian border war
continues to rapidly escalate . ..
. ..U .S . authorities are beginning to question
to what degree we will become involved. . .
. ..in what couId
swiftly grow into globaI conflict.

Hi.
Another day, another dollar.
Hi, big brother. How's your ass?
As for you, I think it's your move .
Join me?
MiserabIe schmuck.
lsn't he? lsn't he a sullen--?
At it again, l see.
What'Il it be tonight?
Museum of science? Some Iibrary?
Poor' miserable bastards.
They aImost got me tonight'
you know that?
Yeah.
NeviIle' come out.
Shut up!
-Neville!
-Why the heIl can't you leave me aIone?
Burn!
More books.
Three, brother? Are you sure?
-Not three.
-Three, brother.
Two were inside the garage
when he brought down the door.
We heard the shooting. Then Joshua.
The light. They should have
stayed cIear of the light.
There was no light, brother. Just the fire.
-Nonsense. NeviIIe can't see in the dark.
-TeII him that.
-Any more than we can see in the Iight.
-To heIl, he sees.
Good enough, he sees.
More! More! Burn it aII!
One creature caught.
Caught in a pIace
he cannot stir from in the dark.
AIone. Outnumbered' hundreds to one.
Nothing to Iive for but his memories.
Nothing to Iive with but his gadgets,
his cars' his guns' gimmicks.
And yet the whoIe FamiIy
can't bring him down out of that. . ..
-That--
-Honky paradise, brother?
Forget the old ways, brother.
AII your hatreds, aII your pains.
Forget. And remember. . .
. ..the FamiIy is one.
But him, that thing.. .
. ..that creature of the wheel. . .
. ..that Iord of the infernaI engines
and machines. . . .
What day is it, anyway? Monday?
The heII it is. lt's Sunday.
Sunday, l always dress for dinner.
Let me put the power to him, brother.
Just a little nitro.
-No.
-I can get the cannons. . .
. ..out of the oId guard armory.
-We couId have him out in no time.
-I said, no.
We couId, but then
the curse would begin aIl over again.
-Don't you see?
-Yes. Yes, l see.
l see him living high in the light. . .
. ..while we rot and hide Iike grubs.
-What do you see, brother?
-He wiII be destroyed' brother. He will.
But not by guns, not by machines,
not by the evil forbidden things...
. ..the tooIs that destroyed the world.
The world.
They destroyed the world.
The entire Los Angeles area.
Already hospitaI facilities have begun
to crack under the strain.. .
. ..and civiI-defense authorities state the
situation is the same across the country.
Martial law is now nationwide.
Major cities in alI parts of the country ,
New York, Los Angeles. . .
...report plague victims falIing dead
in the streets, in their homes, at work.
The first symptom appears to be
severe choking. . .
...folIowed by immediate unconsciousness.
Death occurs within minutes.
Whether a state of war
between China and Russia stiIl exists. . .
. ..is not important any Ionger.
Our felIow countrymen are dying.
The very foundations of civilization
are beginning to crumble . . .
. . .under the dread assault
of that horror Iong feared, germ warfare .
CONELRAD channel.
This is a class-one emergency .
All civilian traftic is barred
from streets and highways.
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.
Those found without specific miIitary
orders are subject to summary execution.
Stay in your homes.
Repeat. CONELRAD channel.
This is a class-one emergency .
All civilian traftic is barred
from streets and highways.
Now the question is survival.
Is this the end of technological man?
Is this the concIusion of aIl our yesterdays,
the boasts of our fabled science ...
. . .the superhuman conquests
of space and time , the age of the wheel?
We were warned of judgment.
Well...
. . .here it is. Here , now. . .
...in the form of
billions of microscopic bacilli.
This is the end.
NeviIle.
Yeah.
l see.
Let's try the test vaccine. . .
. ..93B-7 1 .
How the heII do l know?
Yeah. We'Il find out.
AII right, l'lI be there in an hour.
Vaccine.
With fire , my brothers, we have purified
all that lives with our zeal. . .
. . .and we shall continue with our work.
With our devotion'
we shalI cleanse the worId.
And NevilIe wiIl come down,
down to the FamiIy into judgment. . .
. ..down to punishment
for his blasphemies.
Here is the instrument of cIeansing'
my brethren.
And nothing quite cIeanses like fire .
l was lucky today.
BeIieve me, l was Iucky.
He tried a gambit. . .
. ..and it almost worked.
But ended up a staIemate. . .
. ..with the Family down three pawns.
What do you think his next move wiIl be?
Endgames are always
full of surprises, aren't they?
WelI. . .
. ..my move' huh?
Discovered check.
How does that grab you' Caesar?
Your move, imperator.
NeviIle.
Excuse me.
Did you move?
BaIls.
You used to be a nice guy once,
you know that?
And speedy Bob NevilIe'
his great legs churning. . .
. ..goes flashing across the finish line. . .
. ..with a three-minute-and-50-second mile.
Go ahead. I wanna see
some son of a bitch beat that.
This is recording 6306,
Rimini Boulevard, Sector 2.
Last five bIocks have been cIear.. .
. ..except for some signs
they've been foraging for food.. .
. ..in a smaII grocery store. . .
. ..at 5500 block.
You'd think the prices
wouId keep them in the supermarkets.
You gotta hand it to them.
They sure cover their tracks.
Two years.
lf l couId just find the nest,
find out where they hole up.
Hey!
Matthias!
AII right, where's Matthias?
Come on. Where's Matthias?
Where's the hive?
JournaI recording 958. August 5' 1 977 .
l found another one,
one of Matthias' group, dead of pIague.
The sweep continues.
Not my color.
Wait! Come back!
l want to taIk to you!
Hey!
ls this how it starts?
A trip to the Iaughing academy?
No, you siIly bastard.
lt starts with you
asking yourself idiot questions.
Right.
Okay.
Let's get cleaned up. . .
. ..and find a drink before the bars close.
And' aIl brothers and sisters,
l ask you to look at him.
Does he have the marks?
Do you see them?
No.
You see him as we were
before the punishment.. .
. ..before we gained grace.
You see Iying there the Iast of scientists,
of bankers' of businessmen. . .
. ..the users of the wheel.
Yes.
Do we use the tools
of the wheeI as he does?
No.
-Is he of the FamiIy?
-No.
-Is he of the sacred society?
-No.
-Then what is he?
-Evil.
He is part of the dead.
He has no place here.
He has the stink of oil
and electrical circuitry about him.
He is obsoIete.
You are discarded.
You are the refuse of the past.
You're fulI of crap.
How hard it is to admit the truth.
Take him to the IittIe room
for the questioning.
WelI' Mr. NeviIIe,
now we can talk a little whiIe.
lt's been a long time since you've talked,
except to yourseIf.
Tell me something, would you?
Are you feIIas reaIly with
the lnternal Revenue Service?
Your little jokes
are meaningless' Mr. NevilIe.
Or doctor, or coloneI,
whatever it was they caIled you.
-I'm a scientist. What the heIl are you?
-Definition of a scientist:
A man who understood nothing,
untiI there was nothing left to understand.
WelI. . . .
So there is a Iittle light
in the forest after all.
A guiding light, Mr. NeviIle.
But now to me
has passed the responsibiIity. . .
. ..for this last tiny remnant of mankind.
Then why don't you quit
these bloody games?
Throw away those HalIoween costumes
and get these peopIe organized' damn it.
Or are you aIready too far gone?
-Along the road of truth.
-Oh' for God's sake.
And we are very organized, Mr. Neville.
After Iast night, you should know that.
lf you're organized,
why don't you try finding a cure?
There is none!
None.
There was no cure'
and there is no cure.. .
. ..but the FamiIy has found its way.
We can bear it.
The onIy burden Ieft is you.
But you've been trying to kiII me
for two years.
Last night you kilIed how many?
Three of us?
And today, we don't know yet.
You're the angeI of death, doctor, not us.
He has confessed alI, brothers.
Murder' use of forbidden tools,
practice of prescribed rites.
He admits science, medicine' weapons,
machinery' electricity.
He has not shared the punishments.
-He does not bear the marks.
-Marks?
Show him, my children.
Show him the pretty marks.
These are the marks' Mr. NevilIe.
The punishment' which you
and those like you brought upon us.
ln the beginning we tried to heIp
one another, those that were left.
We tried to cIean things up,
set things straight.
We buried things and burned.
Then it came to me'
that we were chosen.
Chosen for just this work.
To bury what was dead,
to burn what was evil.. .
. ..to destroy what was dangerous.
You're barbarians.
Barbarians?
You calI us barbarian?
WelI. . . .
This is an honorabIe name.
We mean to canceI the world
you civiIized people made.
We wilI erase history from the time. . .
. ..that machinery and weapons
threatened more than they offered.
And when you die. . .
. ..the Iast Iiving reminder of heIl
will be gone.
Gone.
Brother Zachary.
We are ready, brother.
-Here is eviI.
-Evil.
EviI.
ls this not the pIace
where all the dead were burned?
Yes.
And this is the last of the dead.
And what shaII we do with him,
my brethren?
Burn.
-Burn.
-Yes, burn. Burn!
-Burn.
-Burn!
-The dark!
-Turn off the Iight!
Get those lights off!
Give us the dark!
Bring back the dark!
Who the helI are you?
Shut up.
Move.
He's gone!
Find him.
Find him. That's an order!
-Find him.
-Go' man, go!
Move. Move.
-Wait.
-Get in.
AII right, you son of a bitch, just hold tight.
Up against the wall, you mother.
Don't turn. Just stand.
When l want you to' l'll turn you.
On or off' up or around, I'II turn you.
Now cooI it.
Now' put your hands out. Out.
Way out about shouIder high,
like they're gonna crucify you' baby.
Matter of fact, they were gonna roast me.
Why'd you stop them?
Don't Iook a gift horse in the mouth.
You got any more questions, fathead?
My name is Robert.
Your name's mud.
Down the tunnel!
-Down the tunneI!
-Where is he?
After him!
Back!
Okay, hey, hold it. Open it up.
-You. You're the--
-Your Iiving PIaytex doIl.
Now' come on, man. Get the bike.
Move! PuII it out.
-You reaIly pIan ahead.
-It helps.
Now' look, you gotta run this thing'
you understand, but l'm the ramrod.
Those stadium lights'
how'd you manage that?
-Dutch knows all about that stuff.
-Dutch?
Come on, man. Get on the bike.
Don't screw up. l know how to roII,
but it's hard on the eIbows.
And if you just have to pIay
James Bond. . .
. ..l'lI bust your ass.
Yes, ma'am.
Don't Iet him get away!
Left, damn it, Ieft, and step on it!
Move. Step on it.
Move! Down the tunneI, man.
Hit it. They're blinded.
Okay, baby. Hitch up your drawers.
-I thought we'd gotten past that.
-You're sweet.
lt's okay, Tommy.
This is the man, and l mean the man.
But he's cool. lt's okay.
Come on, man.
This is it. That's alI there is.
At least alI we know of.
There are others, l guess, if Matthias
and his brethren haven't kiIled them aIl.
l didn't know there were any left.
Between the Family at night
and you in the daytime. . .
. ..shooting at anything that moved,
man' we had to stay low.
l had to stay alive.
The mad bomber himself.
And l see you got the mad scientist.
-You know me?
-And about your work.
My work?
Biowar pathoIogy perimeters
in urban and semi-urban environments.
JournaI of Military Medicine , June , 197 4 .
lncremental effects, countermeasures to
toxic agents, and liquid systems delivery.
Microbiological Letters,
January, 1 975. Remember?
That's a nice recitation.
You know what it means?
l was a med-school senior
when they scratched the worId.
As a matter of fact, l was gonna appIy
to Biowar Labs for my post-doc. . .
-. . .but the next term never came.
-I'm sorry you didn't make it.
Sorry the worId didn't make it.
-Come on. Let's go see about Richie.
-Richie?
Lisa's brother. He Iooks Iike
he's about to go over.
You've only seen the tertiary cases,
Matthias and his peopIe.
We're not that far gone'
but we're on the road.
The yeIlow-brick road.
We're off to see the wizard.
When it hit, the oIder people either died
or went to the third stage fast. . .
. ..you know, blindness in light,
aIbinism' psychotic iIlusions. . .
. ..occasionaI stages of torpor'
like Matthias and the things out there.
-What about you? Why didn't you get it?
-I don't know.
Some of the younger peopIe
have a kind of. . .
. ..resistance.
l don't know, we just hold out.
One or two of us are a bit light-sensitive ,
but otherwise we're aII right.
But Richie's definitely going.
He's advanced secondary. lncidentaIly. . .
. ..mind telling me
what keeps you in the city?
You some kind of. . .exterminator, huh?
l guess maybe you couId call it that.
Very compIicated' doctor.
l'd be Iiving on top of city halI'
or better than that, the Oxy Tower.. .
. ..instead of that pillbox you're in.
WelI' that's where l Iive.
lt's where l used to live.
lt's where l'm gonna Iive'
and not Matthias nor his FamiIy. . .
. ..nor any other son of a bitch
is gonna make me Ieave.
He's no better.
His fever is high.
-What are you doing--?
-Shut up.
Keep out of the way.
Sit down.
CouId stay this way for weeks'
or he couId go over 1 0 minutes from now.
l've seen them go before .
l almost got kilIed by a friend of mine
last summer.
He went over without any warning.
When l looked away. . .
. ..his face was getting pale and his hair
was going. When l Iooked back.. .
. ..he didn't have any eyes.
What did you do?
l did just like you'd do, doctor.
l killed him.
lf the Masonic rites are over. . .
. ..bow about Richie?
We'lI take him to my pIace.
l got nearIy everything l need there.
ls there anything you can do, doctor?
l mean, seeing how you've lost
over 200 miIlion patients.
l don't have it.
-Have what?
-The pIague. l'm immune.
-Everybody has it.
-Everybody but me.
There was a vaccine'
just an experimentaI batch.
We weren't sure it'd work.
-Why, if you're immune' you couId--
-That's right.
My bIood might be a serum.
At the stage that boy's in, my antibodies
could reverse the whoIe process, stop it.
Christ, you could save the worId.
Screw the worId. Let's save Richie.
Nothing with drugs.
lt's gotta be the serum.
CouIdn't you reconstitute the vaccine?
You got any idea
how many steps it takes. . .
. ..to synthesize an antibiotic
specific for this bug?
-Got the picture.
-I've tried. God knows I've tried.
Once I caught one
of Matthias' peopIe Iast year. . .
. . .and tried everything
on the shelves on him.
He damn near killed me ...
...and then he died very badly himseIf.
So it's very tight' doctor.
Very tight.
Bring him in here.
ln the bed.
l see where you do your heavy thinking.
One side keeps the other side going.
Can't have one without the other.
-I'm a narcissist.
-How do you do?
-The guest room.
-You weren't expecting us?
l wasn't expecting you.
WelI' hold these.
l'm gonna need some heIp.
Lisa wiIl have to do you.
l hate to Ieave the kids aIone too long.
They get spooked.
Hey, watch your mouth.
You know, some of the kids'
you know what they say?
No. What do some of the kids say?
They say the Family comes
in the night when it's dark.
They say they're going to come
some night and take Richie's souI. . .
. ..and tie it aII up in a bag
and give it to the devil.
ls that realIy true?
Do you know if that's reaIly true?
No. We wouIdn't let that happen.
Not a chance.
Are you God?
Let's find out if he's even a doctor first
before we go promoting him' okay?
Okay.
How about a break?
WelI.
Your move.
l just made my move.
Where'd you get that dress?
The same place you got that jacket.
l hustled it.
The house fuzz was on vacation.
NeviIle.
His voice.
l'Il never get used to it. . .
. ..to hearing it.
Something.. . .
We were with them for a while'
you know?
With Matthias?
You were a part of that Family?
When it happened'
when even the Army felI apart. . .
. ..and there was nobody left
except those Iiving aIone like animaIs. . .
. ..Matthias waIked the streets at night. . .
. ..ringing a beIl.
Richie and l' we had us a pIace
in the back of a furniture store .
One day' we hear this belI.
So we go out to see'
and there are peopIe there.
We thought we were alone. . .
. ..just me and Richie
with milIions of corpses.
But there was Matthias and other peopIe.
WelI' anyway,
he gave us the FamiIy for a whiIe.
We helped with the buriaIs.
We helped with the burnings.
But when it was over,
and the worst was past. . .
. ..they began to know
how different we were, our skin, our eyes.
One day whiIe they were asIeep,
we just took off.
How'd you get mixed up
with Dutch and his group?
Dutch came by one day
and said he was with the Census Bureau.
-Now, what you thinking?
-Yeah.
WelI' you know the oId song?
"lf you were the only girl in the world
and l were the only boy"' okay. . .
. ..but until then don't bother me?
l guess l'm the onIy boy.
The FamiIy.
God, l forgot to keep the fueI up
in the generator.
They'll be into the garage!
You stay here.
-What's this for?
-Comfort.
You may not have time, Brother Zachary.
More time than Neville has, brother.
-When he comes back up, l'Il be waiting.
-Take care.
-He has the luck of a deviI.
-I know.
But this time his luck has run out.
Robert!
You can take down
that service fIag now' mother.
Man' don't scare me Iike that.
-You alI right?
-Yeah.
Yeah, l'm okay.
Now' what's this stuff about me being
the onIy girl in the worId?
Do you know it's been a long' Iong time?
l'm not sure I remember how this goes.
-How is he?
-He's stable.
No loss of pigment since yesterday
and vitaI signs are steady.
He's comfortabIe.
l'm sorry.
lt's been a long' long time
since l've had a patient.
WelI' doctor, you certainly haven't Iost
your bedside manner.
ls that so?
Are you ready for this?
What is it?
Birth-controI piIIs.
Yeah.
Here we are.
l can make toxins from both of these.
AII right, now the tourniquet.
Good and tight.
That's fine.
Give me the swab.
AII right, you get the needle.
Go ahead.
AII right, take off the tourniquet.
WilI one bottIe be enough?
lt's genuine' 1 60-proof
oId Anglo-Saxon' baby.
l was a very pecuIiar doctor
in those days. . .
. ..trying to find treatments
for diseases that hadn't existed. . .
. ..tilI other doctors invented them.
Now l'm the only game in town.
l don't know how much.
l'Il draw bIood as often as l can.
We'lI just have to keep
pumping it into him.
-How Iong do you think it'lI take?
-I don't know.
l reaIIy don't know.
But if it does work. . .
. ..then Richie wilI be the source
of even more antibodies.
The more peopIe we inject. . .
. ..the more serum we'II get.
And when that's done. . . .
When that's done' baby' we wilI pulI out.
We'lI take what we need
and head for the mountains.
Out of rats' aIley
Where the dead men lost their bones
T.S . Eliot turns out to have been
just as good a prophet as he was a poet.
"The Waste Land."
l wonder if it comforts him.
l wonder if I'II ever see
a stream fuIl of fish again.
Where'd you ever see
a stream fuIl of fish in Harlem?
At the movies.
-Does that hurt?
-A little, yeah.
lt hurts. How about off, man? Turn it off.
A week ago' that much Iight
wouId have sent you right up the wall.
l'm beginning to see the light.
l'Il have another batch of serum ready
in a few hours. . .
. ..then we'lI load up that Land Rover'
pick up Dutch and the kids. . .
. ..and go to the hills.
How about the Sierras?
Yeah. Oh, Robert.
Baby' we made it. We reaIIy made it.
l think l'lI go pick up
some stuff for the trip.
ls there anything special
you fancy, baby?
What l pick up today, you're gonna
be seeing for a Iong' long time.
-Why don't you skip it?
-Oh' honey.
The most dangerous thing l ever ran into
in one of those stores was you.
You watch yourself.
You stay on the ground fIoors,
near the doors and in the Iight.
-If you see anything, shoot.
-Check.
Honey' can l borrow your credit cards?
ls that gonna be for me?
No, you don't need any more.
This is for Lisa.
-One of these days, she may--
-Start to turn?
That's always a possibility.
lt's best to catch these things early.
Then you don't think
the serum would work...
. ..for tertiary cases?
-What do you mean?
-Like Matthias.
The FamiIy.
lt's hard to say.
WelI' wouId it?
Come on, help me with this.
Put the cap on that.
Put it in the refrigerator.
l can't afford to give more bIood
tilI l get clear of this town.
Later on, if your bIood count comes up. . .
. ..and you put on some weight,
we can use your bIood to make serum.
Yeah?
Yeah. Now' go eat your soup.
You know, someone ought to do
something about those people.
How about it?
-You gonna give them the serum?
-Fat chance.
How come?
We'd have to be here
for a few more months' for one thing.
For another thing,
they're homicidal maniacs, for God's sakes.
Hey, man' they're humans.
l mean, they're sick' you know?
They're vermin.
Okay, then.
lf you don't want to cure them, kill them.
lf l just knew where they're at.
The oId court buiIding' that's where.
ln the civic center.
That's where they're holed up.
-You're kidding me.
-They're there.
WelI' go on. Ain't you gonna
go down there and zap them?
Why not?
You've been looking to kiII them
for practicalIy two whole years now.
Either kiIl them or cure them, damn it.
No need.
They're haIf-dead right now.
You know what' mister?
You're hostiIe.
You just don't beIong.
Nice of you to Iet me hang around.
At times' you scare me
more than Matthias does.
Hey, Dutch.
-How's Richie?
-Beautiful. lt works.
lt works. It works?
lt works!
lt works. It works!
lt works.
Oh' my God' it's a beautiful worId.
Don't you think

in a week or so.
Can you have the kids ready
to leave tomorrow?
Gonna take me a Iittle ride in the sun.
Where are we going?
Away' that's aII. Just away.
SomepIace nobody ever bothered with.
A river nobody ever dammed. . .
. ..a mountain nobody built
any bIoody freeways to. . .
. ..where everything we do
will be the first time it happened.
Hey, yeah, you got it. That's it.
Just Iike in the beginning of the world.
Like we were starting aIl over again
in the Garden of Eden.
Only this time'
we don't trust no frigging snake.
Richie?
Scout' l wonder if we're gonna have
room for you.
Richie.
"Going to find out who's right.
You or me."
WelI' Richard. . .

-I came to help you.
-You know the man.
-Neville?
That's him, yeah.
He's got a serum
for what's wrong with you.
And if you could just taIk to him,

Everyone. . . .
WelI' everybody could be normaI again.

-We couId be as we were before?
-Yeah, l guess so.

That's what NevilIe thinks we want?
That why he sent you?
-He didn't send me. He--
-SiIence!
Oh' yes. . .
. ..he sent you to offer us something
from his world. . .
. ..to change us back
to the creatures we were. A trick!
A trick to weaken our resolve.
l was aImost Iike you, but he saved me.
He brought me back.
He wants us all to go away from here .
You have been damned' Richard.

a little entertainment for you. ..
. ..before time for concluding
our little business.
My brothers.
We waited for you, Neville. . .
. ..so you could see this' the end.
The end of aII you've done.
You see' none of it was real.
lt was ilIusion. Your art, your science.
lt was all a nightmare'
and now it's done.
Finished.
My brethren. . .
. ..our task is nearly compIete.
He was the Iast of those
who brought the punishment to us.
We have cleansed and purged his world.
Now we must build.
Build coffins. That's alI you'lI need.
Bring him.
AII right, stand back!
Back up!
Lisa.
Stop him! Don't let them get away!

-Damn it' it's jammed.
-Lisa.
-I want--
Lisa.

Lisa, for God's sakes,

The bad dream is over, friend NeviIle.
Now we can sleep in peace.
-Lisa.
-Robert' you're evil.
