In the year of Lord 1442.
The Turkish Sultan enslaved
1,000 Transylvania boys.
To fill the ranks of his army.
These child slaves were beaten
without mercy.
Trained to kill without
conscience.
To crave the blood...
of all who would fight
the Turks.
From among these boys...
one grew into a warrior so
fearsome...
that entire armies would retreat
in terror...
to the mention of his name...
Vlad the Impaler.
Son of the Dragon.
Sickened by his monstrous act...
Vlad came to bury his past
with the dead...
and returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.
His subjects called him Prince.
I called him Father.
But the world would come to
know him as...
Dracula.
I left it...
where I found it.
What do you think, Vlad?
Bring it to me.
This belongs to a scout.
One of Hamza Bey's men.
What the hell is a lone Turk
doing out here?
Turkish scouts never travel
alone.
If there is one, there is more.
And whatever they scout... they
conquer.
This is washed downstream.
It came from up there.
Broken Tooth Mountain.
Soon it will be night.
They'll seek refuge.
Dumitru, I need you to return
to the castle.
Alert the guards and double
the sentry.
What?
I'm not leaving you here.
The Turks to cross into my land
unannounced, is a sign of war.
What are you going to do, if
you find them?
I'll do what Princes do best,
negotiate.
Nicolai, Andre, with me.
Anything?
It smell like your feet.
They're inside.
How do you know?
Bats don't come out during
the day.
Something's disturbed them.
Come on.
What is it, my Lord?
The floor...
it's crushed to the bone.
The Turks didn't do this.
What's that?
We leave.
Now.
The creature you encountered
was no accident, my Prince.
Four nights ago, every brother
of our order awoke...
from an identical dream.
I would not have thought it
possible, had I not...
suffered the same vision myself,
that night.
Of a creature laying siege to
this holy place.
The Romans mystics prophecized
the coming of a great evil.
A vampire.
From the Greek word, Vry.
To drink.
The beast was once a mortal
man, who summoned the demon...
from the depths of hell, to
trade for his dark power.
The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish.
But his price was an eternity
condemned to the darkness...
of that cave...
where he remains, until he finds
another... to set him free.
Now you know it's true face.
The people of Transylvania are
living in the fear...
of the Turks' return.
Promise me you'll guard this
secret, brother.
Papa!
I've missed you.
And I, you.
My big soldier.
What, an embrace, but no kiss?
Are we going to argue?
Do you always leave your new
wife (inaudible)?
I've missed you.
Something troubles you,
what is it?
Only the impossible depths of
your beauty.
Puts the rest of the world
to shame.
Pay no attention to your
father, Ingeras.
Flattery is a cheap distraction
from truth.
Ah, she knows all my tricks.
You're a terrible liar.
It's one of your most endearing
qualities.
You're just in time for bed.
Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?
Of course we can.
You most certainly cannot!
Why not?
Because tomorrow is the day
of our recent Lord.
Ah, of course.
That's Easter.
What was I thinking...
So, what attacked you?
Wolves?
I suppose.
All I know... is that I've lost
two good men, today.
There is something more...
I was the same age as Ingeras,
when I was sent to live...
with the Turks.
To fight for them.
If I never saw another, it
would be too soon.
You're home, now.
For almost as many years as
you were gone.
I just want peace, that's all.
My fellow Transylvanians, an
Easter toast.
Ten years of peace and
prosperity...
ever since our prince came
back to us.
My old friend, here's to
twenty more..
Hamza bey... welcome.
We were not expecting you
so soon.
Sultan Mehmed the II offers his
salutation to you, and your son.
Thank you.
I have his tribute ready.
I am afraid there's something
more than a tribute, to discuss.
The Turks has no enemies here.
Did you think we would not
notice...
a battalion of our scouts,
missing?
I did not kill them.
The sultan's tribute.
Take it and leave.
There is one last thing.
The Sultan requires 1,000 boys
to join his Janissary Corps.
No!
Never!
Jannisaries? He ended that
practice years ago.
When a soldier is plucked as
a child...
and raised to know no other
life...
they will kill without question,
and die without complaint.
Any who are fifteen years of age
or older, will fight in Hungary.
Those ten to fourteen will be made
ready for the siege of Vienna.
The sultan expects your obidience.
After all, did not your own father
give you up without a fight?
Don't, please.
It must be done.
Courage, anger, even love...
non of these can matter to
a prince.
All that matters is his duty
to his people.
What does it mean to be a royal
hostage?
My father gave me to the sultan,
to prove his loyalty.
Were you scared there, with
them?
I wanted to make my father
proud.
Do you have to give me to
the Sultan?
That was a long time ago.
You have nothing to worry about.
You understand?
Good.
If I defy the order, they'll kill
a hundred for every one I save.
You told me you and Mehmed
were once like brothers.
Why don't you ask... isn't it
possible he might show you...
some mercy?
Have you ever seen the like
of it?
Soon the entire world will
be Turk.
Lord Impaler.
My oldest of friends.
I miss our days together.
All I miss from my time with
you... is the coffee.
It's true, my father's palace
was a cruel place...
for a young boy far from home.
But soon you talked like us,
prayed like us, fought like us.
Speaking of which, I am owed
a thousand boys.
Why I have not seen them?
Mehmed, my brother...
I will grant you anything else.
I need soldiers...
"brother."
Then take me.
I'm worth a thousand boys, and
you know it.
Those kings would tremble, if
they knew.
Then accept my offer.
When we were boys, how I longed
to fight side by side.
But now I'm sultan, what need
do I have for one soldier?
I will have my thousand boys.
And one more.
Your son will be raised under
my roof.
Just as you were raised under
the roof of my father.
You may retain your throne.
But General Ismail will remain to
see that my orders are fulfilled.
What is one son? If you're virile,
you'll make plenty more.
You promised this would never
happen.
Merina, listen.
The day you asked for my hand,
do you remember what I said?
You said no.
I knew what happens to the
sons of a queen.
You said things would be
different!
You said if I loved you, I should
trust you.
I love you!
Then trust me!
It's this, or we start a war!
He's just saying his goodbyes,
is all.
I will not let you... you
promised to my family!
I won't let them do this.
I'll go.
I'll go.
I can do it.
You are proud of me, aren't
you?
Of course, I am.
You have chosen wisely.
I have to say, we are a little
disappointed.
Frankly, I expected more
resistance from you.
Run to your mother.
What?
Now!
Mehmed will punish all of
Transylvania...
for what you have done.
It's not a child's place to
save his country.
Get my family to the castle.
Mehmed will be sending others
soon enough.
War will come.
You can't protect us.
I'll find a way.
Vlad, where are you going?
Whatever horror's in Broken
Tooth... I know it kills Turks.
You returned.
Noone has ever returned.
Seems no one has ever had the
privilege of leaving, either.
Neither will you.
Those are meant to reek of fear.
In you... I sense hope.
Your silver offends me, cloak
it from my sight.
What kind of man crawled into
his own grave...
in search of hope?
Mm?
A desperate one.
The Turks threaten to destroy
my kingdom.
Power like yours... I could
stop them.
Save my people.
Save my family.
How supremely noble, Lord Impaler.
Or it's Dracul, son of the
devil?
You're mistaken.
It means "Son of the dragon,
protector of the innocent."
Do your people know how many
innocents you have killed?
Was it... hundreds?
Yes.
Lie to me again, and I'll open you
from your belly to your brain...
and feed you your intestines.
Thousands.
And when you put them to the
stake, what did you feel?
Shame, horror, power?
Answer me!
Nothing.
I felt nothing.
A greater crime than the act
itself.
Then why spill blood, if not
for the pleasure of it?
Because men do not fear swords.
They fear monsters.
They run from them.
By putting one...
village to the stake, I spare
ten more.
Sometimes the world no longer
needs a hero.
Sometimes what it needs, is
a monster.
And you believe you know what
it is to be a monster?
You have no idea.
But I am going to show you.
For centuries these mouldering
walls have been my gallows.
For I'm bound to this cave,
condemned by one who turned me.
Oh, I've waited an eternity
for a man of your strength.
Your gifts, your will.
A man, worthy of the dark...
and all its powers.
For if I am your salvation,
you are mine.
Drink, you will have a taste
of my power.
The strength of a hundred men.
The speed of a falling star.
Dominion over the night...
and all it's creatures, to see
and hear through their senses.
Even heal gravest wounds.
At what price?
Once you drink, your thirst for
human blood will be insatiable.
But if you can resist for
three days...
you'll return to your mortal
state, having sampled my power...
and perhaps, saved your people.
And if I feed?
The price will be worse than if
you'd never stepped, in here.
Well, I will be set free...
having granted the darkness
a worthy offering.
You will become its vessel,
as I am.
A scourge on this Earth.
Destined to destroy...
everything you hold dear, your
lands, your people...
even your precious wife and
son.
I would die before I harm them.
Indeed you will, I'm afraid.
I however would at last be free
to unleash...
my wrath against the one who
betrayed me.
And one day I will call on you
to serve me, my pawn.
Ending the mortal game of
revenge.
This is not a game!
Ah, what better way to endure
eternity?
This, little prince, is the
ultimate game.
Light versus dark.
Hope versus despair.
And all the word's fate hangs
in the balance.
And it will be my great pleasure
to disappoint you.
Drink.
Let the games begin.
What now?
Now...
you die.
Papa!
It's useful.
Fire!
You came back.
I always will.
Where were you?
Searching for the strength
I needed.
You're back.
They wanted our sons!
A good Prince would have given
them up!
A good Prince would have paid
that price, for peace.
But I give you my word.
We will not be defeated!
They brought war to our land,
and they will pay dearly for it.
Fire!
Negotiation's failed.
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight...
trust only that I will use all
I have, to keep us safe.
But we will not be safe, if we
stay here!
We must leave directly for
Casio Monastery.
It's high in the mountains.
Too remote for cannon fire.
It's our best chance of survival.
We'll take enough of our people,
so that our absence is noticed.
That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here...
he'll come hunting for us.
Word from Castle Dracula.
Vlad has defeated a thousand
of our men.
Then send a hundred thousand.
I will lead them.
When I march into Europe, I will
have his head upon my spear...
and his child?
At my side.
We can fight the way our great
grandfathers fought.
Use the forests, the mountains
around the Burgo Pass.
Four or five months of that.
Not months.
I'm gonna win this war in three
days.
Why not two?
That really impresses.
What is it?
I need some air.
I'm sorry.
Don't think I haven't noticed
you following me.
You're mistaken.
I follow them.
They recognize one of their
own.
The night is their kingdom,
blood, their sustenance.
And some may say... have lived
for as long as there have been...
prey to devour.
Spare me your ravings.
They say the one who escaped
the mountains...
hides behind the face of a man.
Well, if that man is me...
you know a knife will not do you
any good.
Of course not.
Why do you think I stayed?
I know there's only so far on
this earth they can run.
And it is not far enough.
Let me serve you.
Stay away from me.
Yes, Master.
We found him in the field.
He asked for you.
A message from Prince Vlad.
He hopes you enjoy the view.
Your scars are gone?
What's happening to you?
I'm the thing men fear on
Broken Tooth.
Not a ghost.
Something else.
No!
Stop it!
May God strike down whoever
did this to you.
I chose this.
This is the strength you sought?
But why?
Because I sent corpses back to
Mehmed, instead of our son.
You did this for us?
In two days I'll be restored.
I just have to resist.
Resist what?
Resist what, Vlad?
Tell me.
The Thirst... for blood.
And if you were to give in?
Then I become this for eternity.
You will not do this, won't you?
Yes.
I swear, I will not give in.
So God will forgive you.
Vlad! Mehmed is getting closer.
You might want to move out soon.
I need you to get to the monastery
as quickly as you can.
Mehmed's men will be close
behind.
No!
Listen to me.
I will reach you after sundown.
I promise you.
I love you.
My husband agrees with your
council.
We will depart now, under your
temporary command.
What?
Where is Vlad going to be?
Spying on the Turks.
He insists on doing his own
reconnaissance.
No.
I won't allow it.
It's too late.
He's already gone.
All right, everyone.
Prepare to move out!
Tell the Sultan where his enemies
will be buried.
Listen.
We are nearly there.
Cover the rear.
Couldn't these monks put the
gate a little bit closer?
Stay behind me.
Didn't the Turks teach you
anything?
I saw your blade coming from...
Ingeras, run!
Where is your Prince now...
my Lady?
Dimitru?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Vlad.
Dimitru, listen.
Listen!
No.
Come here.
Never leave us again, Papa.
Never.
I will always watch over you.
To the gate!
Keep moving on!
This way!
You should never've straight
from us!
Whatever your reasons for
leaving...
Quiet.
Get these men off their knees.
Stand up, d'you hear me?
Stand up!
The turks are coming! Prayers
will not defend these walls!
Do you believe we can do this?
Mehmet's men will be coming
from the north.
Double our sentries on the
perimeter walls. Go, do it now!
What's in there?
Something I hoped to never
use again.
Come now.
The men say that Vlad has
become a monster.
I fear this will only inflect
the rumors...
of the Prince's dark magic.
Only if we allow it.
Men cannot fear what they
cannot see.
Remember when you first joined
my army!
You wanted to pick up your sword
and fight!
When my generals blindfolded
you...
you did not believed that you
could march without seeing.
But you could!
Now march with me!
Your sultan will guide you!
Prince Vlad, the vampire is
vulnerable to daylight.
And to pure silver.
Yet the holy cross excerts
no power over you.
That can only mean you have yet
to seal your fate...
with human blood.
Let me kill you now, my Prince.
Please!
Before your people do. Rumor has
spread of what you have become.
You can still repent.
You'll do well to run, Lucien.
He's a vampire.
No!
Listen! He is your Prince!
Please give him a chance to explain!
Stop, please!
Kill the monster!
Satan lives in his heart!
Vlad...
Try to save his soul.
Take him to my room and shut
the door.
Do not let him not look outside.
Mama!
This is your loyalty?
Your gratitude?
Fools. Do you think you're
alive because you can fight?
You are alive because of me!
Because of what I did to
save you!
This is not who you are.
Return to your stations.
Believe me, there is still more
to fear!
Lord, if you've not yet
forsaken me...
grand me your strength, that
I may resist the darkness.
Allow me to endure this test
one more day.
I beg you.
Please.
Are you sick?
If you are sick, thought this
make you feel better.
Thank you.
Come.
You'll make a great leader
some day.
You think of others before
yourself.
When the Turks came to take
me... you stopped them.
That's why you got sick,
isn't it?
To save me?
Yes.
And I would do it all again.
They're almost here.
Sun will be breaking soon, and
with it, the last of my powers.
If we've not won this war
by then...
I will fight beside you until
death.
Your death would end my fight.
We have done the duty of any
good parent.
Protected our child.
Protected all the children
in the kingdom.
Perhaps our destiny was not
to rule in this life.
Do you remember our wedding vow?
Why think separately of this
life and the next...
When one is born from the last?
Time is always too short for
those who need it.
But for those who love...
lasts forever.
Stand your position!
Stand your position!
Fire!
Mehmed!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Fire!
Find your father, go!
Where is he?
You can keep running, if
you like.
Mama!
Let me go!
No!
Mirena!
No, please!
Ingeras!
No!
No!
No!
Please, stay with me.
I can not do this without you.
Mirena!
There's still time for you
to stop them.
Drink my blood.
No!
I can not take your life.
My life is lost already.
But our son's is not.
No!
I love you.
Do it now.
Please.
Do it now.
Do you want vengeance?
Drink.
I now know, hell is real.
So I know there's a heaven.
Neither this world nor the
next shall keep us apart.
I will honor your sacrifice and I
vow that our son shall be safe.
Of all my lands, this is the
one I love the least.
Look to the east. The sun should
be risen by now, should it not?
What is that?
It is the prince.
He's coming.
I used to think there were
too many of you.
Now there's not enough.
I understand you have a weakness.
Pure silver.
Papa!
He's waiting for you.
You're slower, brother, and
weaker.
Go on, take it!
Is this the monster that
terrified my men?
You grow more weary by the
moment.
Tell me, how long can you bear
it, in here?
Long enough to strike your name
from the history books.
Papa!
Look at your father, Ingeras.
Look how pathetic he is.
No, stop!
Please!
If I put the stake through
your heart..
it will kill you.
Like any other man.
A fitting death...
for Lord...
No!
Impaler!
Noo!
Papa!
That is no longer my name.
My name is Dracula.
Son of the Devil.
It's all right, I'm here.
You old goat.
I don't feel old.
How many are left?
None...
except for your son, of course.
A distraction we can now dispense
with.
What have I told you?
Repeated, over and over, since
you were a boy?
All that matters is the prince's
duty to his people.
Don't you realize?
They are all our enemy, now.
When he's gone, you'll be free.
You forget who I am?
Leave him.
Come with me, child.
Please.
Reverse!
It has to stop.
Please!
I don't want to leave you.
You have to go with him.
No!
Do not leave his side.
No!
I will always love you.
Always.
Go!
No!
Please.
Go.
No!
You take care of him.
No!
Papa!
No!
No!
He's safe now, Mirena.
The Turks never conquered the
capitals of Europe.
Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.
But there are no pictures,
or statues of him.
I... am his legacy.
His sacrifice taught me, that
even after the darkest night...
the sun will rise again.
Drink, master.
For if the heart is strong
enough, the soul is reborn...
with each new day.
In life after life.
Age after age.
Forever.
Beautiful.
The flowers, my lady.
My lady?
Where are you from?
Far away from here.
Well, good night.
I think separately of this
life, and the next.
When one is born from the last.
It's my favorite poem.
It speaks to you of yearning.
Of one soul, pleading for another.
I am Mina.
Vlad.
Let the games begin.
