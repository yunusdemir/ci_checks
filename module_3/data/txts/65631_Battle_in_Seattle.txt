1947: shortly after
the close of World War ll,
23 nations signed
a general agreement
on tariffs and trade,
the GATT.
Its purpose was to liberalize
and expand world trade.
Stability,
a sense of global community:
they were the key.
For five decades,
the GATT will grow,
adding more members and becoming
the World Trade Organization.
We are writing the constitution
for a single global economy.
With over 150 member nations,
the WTO controls
90% of world trade.
Unlike the GATT, the WTO
can impose punishing fines
on member countries
that don't abide by its laws.
Along with this expansion
of free trade,
the WTO avows to help
developing countries
benefit fully from
the global trading system.
It has very little
to do with trade,
and it's certainly not free.
It's a system
of global governance
none of us voted for
and none of us control.
It simply means breaking down
the borders of countries.
So that large corporations
will be free to operate anywhere
without interference
by governments
or the people of these nations.
And what they are saying
is that money values
should rule over life values,
that human rights
and the environment
should be subordinated
to the needs of commerce.
The clean air rules were gutted.
Cases of asthma increased.
Genetically modified foods
forced onto European consumers.
Small-scale banana growers
crushed by large corporations.
Despite the problems
and criticism,
the WTO continues to grow,
making it more powerful
than ever.
On the upcoming meeting
in Seattle,
dubbed the Millennium Round,
new issues will be added
to the WTO's existing rules.
lmposing even tighter
corporate control
over more areas of our lives.
To many, this meeting
has become a battle
for the future.
<i></i>
All right, here,
you take this, man.
Jay, she's turtling.

Shit. Hold it.
Okay, you drop
the rope.
<i>AH right,
I'm coming to get you.</i>
It's all right.
I got you.
Not much of a last-minute
replacement, am I?
No, but you're better-looking
than he was.
Hey, don't get any ideas.
<i>Imus! have checked everything
three times.</i>
I never ended up
like this before.
<i>
That's Why you got to be</i>
a little crazy to take this gig.
All right,
you're good.
Okay, you wait for my signal
before we descend, all right?
I'm Lou, by the way.
Oh. Jay.

We better get going before
you're eating breakfast in jail.
I don't plan on getting arrested
until at least tomorrow.

Fuck.
- Close one.
- Yeah, real smooth.
All right, let's do it.

Tomorrow,
the World Trade Organization
will meet in Seattle.
It will be the largest meeting
on global trade ever known...
Jimmy Hoffa
and the labor unions,
along with environmentalists
and human rights advocates,
put together a rally
at Memorial Stadium
with an estimated 30,000
to 40,000 people.
More than 50,000 protesters
may be in the streets
to demonstrate against the WTO.
It's been 30 years since
the Democratic convention riots
in 1968 pitted police and
protestors against each other.
But some fear history
will repeat itself
this week in Seattle
as the World Trade Organization
prepares to hold
<i>its first ever ministerial
meeting on U.S. soil.</i>
We have identified
the subjects
of our most recent
surveillance photos,
and they're not anarchists
as we originally thought.
All right, so we have
a great team of lawyers
that are pulling together
to help us out on this.
It's really important
that you call this number.
<i>
AH right Jay:!</i>
All right.

First one: Django Mills,
<i>arrested in four different
countries for property damage</i>
involving whaling ships
and shrimp trawlers.
<i>Louise Phillips:</i>
<i>burned down her father's
animal research lab,</i>
<i>although she wasn't
formally charged.</i>
She has been involved
in Black Bloc demonstrations
that have turned violent.
<i>Samantha Clayton."
no criminal record,</i>
appears to have studied law,
<i>and was involved in
the Sequoia Forest legal case</i>
back in '98.
And last but not least,
Jay Elgin.
We got 13 major intersections
downtown,
and each of the affinity groups
are gonna shut these areas down.
Now, how are we gonna do it?
<i>
Non violently.</i>
That's right,
and by consensus.
Jay's brother was killed
in the Sequoia Forest
demonstration.
<i>
Hem!
Hem!</i>
My brother's been hit.
<i>My brother's been hit!
Get an ambulance!</i>
My brother's been hit.

<i>Don'! arrest me!
My brother's been hit!</i>
We need an ambulance!
Since then,
he's been involved
in every major demonstration
across the country,
including getting himself
arrested at the IMF in '98.
We need a show of hands
of those of you
that are prepared to go to jail
if need be.
<i>And don't feel bad
if you're not.</i>
<i>We need as many people
on the outside as We can get.</i>
All right, people,
well, opening ceremonies
begin in about 24 hours,
so please get ready
'cause we're gonna shut
these motherfuckers down!
All right?

We set up
two tripwire barricades
around the Paramount Theatre.
Now, we believe
that all the protesters
will be concentrated there.
Now, to get through that,
they're gonna
have to climb fences,
jump over Metro buses,
at which point
they'll be arrested.
Well, make sure we're only
arresting them there, okay?
I want to keep
this city's image clean.
How many protesters
are we expecting?
Several thousand.
Maybe 10,000.
Are we ready for this?
Quite sure of it.
The WTO opening ceremonies
are scheduled to take place
at the Paramount Theatre
downtown.
<i>
issues such as human rights,</i>
<i>labor standards,
and environmental protection</i>
<i>are not on the formal agenda
of the Seattle meeting,</i>
<i>but with more than 20,000
WTO critics planning to march,</i>
<i>I! looks as though...</i>
What?
That makes no sense to you?
I'm just looking
for a good story.

<i>
Nothing irregular.</i>
<i>Everything seems great.</i>
<i>Looks like you're going to be
having</i> a <i>very healthy baby</i>
four months from now.
-
- Ah.
Have you chosen
any names yet?
No, not-not-
not really.
Yeah, well,
there's a few we like, right?
Yeah, she has a few she likes.

<i>! got to go, baby-</i>
Oh, no.
Don't go now.
I wish I didn't have to,
but I'm running late as it is.
I love you, baby.
Come on,
five more minutes.
This protest
is driving me crazy.
It hasn't even
started yet.
Oh, come on.
<i>I'll call you.</i>
Doc, will you look after
this woman?
'Cause she's made me very happy.
<i>
I sure will.</i>
I'll see you.

<i>
it's taken two years</i>
to bring the World Trade
Organization to Seattle,
and we did it.

<i>
Nathan, you've arrived,
safe and sound.</i>
<i>May I present Nathan Abasi,</i>
one of the toughest negotiators
in the Southern Hemisphere.
<i>
I bet Mr. Dural was telling you</i>
I will be cutting
agricultural resources.

Along the way, the Emerald City
has beaten out Detroit,
Denver, Dallas, San Diego,
and Honolulu.
Oh, have you met
Dr. Alex Mario?
<i>He's from Bosnia
but works in Africa</i>
<i>with Médecins Sans Frontiéres.</i>
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
He's here to raise awareness
about cost of AIDS medications.
Oh.
Yeah.
<i>
Well, I hope</i>
you have more luck at
these talks than I usually do.
<i></i>
I welcome all of you
for what will be a productive
and successful week.
To success.
<i>
Thank you.
Thank you all.</i>


Well, I've just been
to the WTO cocktail party...

Where the hors d'oeuvres
were much better
but the music not so good.

You may or may not know this,
but I was once a protestor too
during Vietnam,
so I'm happy to have
the demonstrator's voice
be heard.
In turn, I've been promised
by numerous organizations
that there will be no violence.
If we stick to this plan,
I believe we will achieve
all that is hoped for.
What I'm trying to say is,
be tough on your issues,
but be gentle on my town.
Thank you.
Thank you.

-
- All right.
Six months' planning,
here we go.
What time is it?
Don't know.
That was nice
last night.
We should get going.
What?
Man, you are not much
of a morning person, are you?
<i>
You check the roster?</i>
<i>
you can call in sick today.</i>
Heads up.
<i>Chief said there might be
chemical or bio attacks today.</i>
<i>
My fucking chemicals
right here.</i>
Oh, yeah?
I think if there was gonna be
chemical warfare,
we'd have more than
a couple hundred guys out there.
How's Ella and the baby?
Ah, great.
Yeah, we went for
the ultrasound yesterday,
and you can see
the whole little body
and even down
to the little fingers.
And then you hear
the heartbeat...

Really fast,
like the little guy was saying,
"Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy."
<i>
So how'd you get into this?</i>
- What are you, a cop?
- Yeah.
And if you don't answer
my questions,
I'm gonna handcuff you.
When I was an animal activist,
I used to think
the strong prey on the weak.
When I was an anarchist,
I thought we could all be equal.
- What about now?
- <i>I</i> don't know.
I'm just taking one long look
at the enemy.
What about you,
hotshot?
What's got your panties
all in a bunch?
My panties are in bunch
because I want to make sure
that everything runs smoothly
and nobody gets hurt.
Of course we're gonna get hurt.
What do you think this is?
Pretty tough, aren't you?
Protests get me excited
and depressed at the same time.
I don't know what that makes me.
Hey, we're gonna move
in 15 minutes, Dale.
We're not keeping you,
are we?
<i>
No, sir.</i>
- Good luck out there.
- Luck?
The only people
that's gonna need luck
is those fucking
tree huggers.
Give me your arm.
Your number?
It's a lawyer's number
for when you're in jail.
I thought you were gonna be
my knight in shining armor.
I think rescuing you
on the crane was enough.

<i>
All right, kids,</i>
enough small talk;
come on.
We got to get moving.
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I</i> Oh, I, I, I am dreaming <i>I</i>
<i>I</i> of a white Christmas <i>I</i>
How'd it go yesterday?
Oh, my God,
you have to see this.
- Let me see.
- Look at that.
Oh, my God.
We are going shopping
for baby clothes immediately.
I don't even know
what it is yet.
Come on, you're
five months pregnant,
and you haven't bought
any baby clothes.
I'm just waiting,
you know?
So is it a boy or a girl?
I don't want to know.
Wow, is that
a police badge I see?
Ah, you're so funny.
Anyway, I hate to break up
this baby shower,
but I need someone at the other
register tout de suite.
What is it with him
and foreign languages?
Congratulations.
You look beautiful.
You are the people.
You are the power.
And we're gonna show it today
when we march.

When we live
under economic systems
that want to divide us
from each other,
but we will not today
be divided.
All right,
bring it in now.
Come on, come on.
Quick, quick, quick.
They're over
the barricade.
Okay, they're moving,
they're moving.
GO, go: go'
Go. Bring 'em in.
Bring 'em in.
Get it in there.
Here they come.
Here they come.
Jay, we're set over here.
Take care of yourself.
Nobody out.
Nobody in; nobody out.
<i>Nobody in; nobody out.</i>
Nobody in.
<i>
Hey, Sam, we've taken
the Paramount.</i>
How you holding up?
Yeah.
We're moving now.
All right.
See you later.
Let's shut 'em down!
Go, go, go!
Move, move!
<i>
Whose strength?</i>
Our strength.
Whose strength?
Our strength.
Whose strength?
Our strength.
<i>Whose strength?</i>
We have lockdown.

<i>I</i> Civil unrest has begun
to erupt in the global village <i>I</i>

<i>II</i>
<i>II</i>
<i>
Jean.</i>
What's going on?
The delegates can't get
to the Paramount.
What?
Okay, let's go there.
Nobody in; nobody out.
I have to be inside,
please.
You go back
to your hotel.
I'm not WTO.
WTO can help us.
I'm sorry, man, we're gonna
shut 'em down today.

<i>
We were given assurance
by we my</i>
<i>that this would not happen.</i>
Sir, I have some news.
It's not good.
Just tell me what the hell
is going on out there.
Look at this place.
Most of the delegates
can't get to the conference.
The protesters have seized
the intersections outside.
Weren't the police
preventing that?
Uh, no, sir.
Well, why not?
As you ordered,
there were to be no arrests made
outside of the barricades.
Look, the police have been
trying to secure safe passage
<i>for the delegates
and the ambassadors</i>
<i>but the protesters have
cemented their arms together.</i>
What?
They formed circles
so that the only way
you can separate them
is by breaking their arms.
Sir, the chief of police
is on line one.
Gordon, I thought you said
they wouldn't get past
the barricades.
<i>
We got</i> a <i>lot bigger problems
than that, Jim.</i>
<i>Right now, they've captured
the entire downtown core.</i>
There's so many
of them out there,
we couldn't arrest them all
even if we wanted to.
I thought they
were nonviolent.
<i>They're not being violent.</i>
All right,
what are we gonna do?
<i>I have called every patrol
in the state.</i>
<i>We even called
the fire department</i>
to hose down the protesters,
but they refused.
What are the options then?
There's only one option left.
Gordon...
lam not gonna start
gassing people, do you hear me?
I gave the protesters my word.
The press would have
a field day with me.
Uh, Jim, I think we're past
having that choice.
<i>
Sir, the White House
is on line two.</i>
All right,
I'll get it.
All right.
Just do whatever you have to do,
and just do it fast.
Nervous, Johnson?
Nervous?
What, are you fucking
kidding me, man?
I put on all this shit;
It's like I'm fucking
invincible, bitch.
Yeah, I used to feel that way
when I was a toddler.
We got some new orders,
so listen up.
<i>We're going to
the Paramount Theatre,</i>
and orders are to use
disbursement techniques.
<i>No arrests are to be made.
Understood?</i>
Wait, wait.
So you're saying if a protester
is breaking the law,
I'm supposed to, what,
just stand there and watch 'em?
That's right, Johnson.
That's coming from the top.
<i>We're gonna be there in five,
so refs be ready.</i>
Can you tell me the reason
why you're here today?
Well, basically,
the Endangered Species Act
requires that
shrimp trawlers
place special devices
on their boats
to prevent the killing
of sea turtles.
Now, the WTO,
they come along, and they say,
"Well, these devices
are somehow illegal..."
Well, we all love turtles,
but don't you think
there are more important
problems in the world
that need to be addressed?
If you feel that a ruling that
threatens an endangered species
is any different from, say,
millions of working-class jobs
being outsourced
or the quality
of our environment
or our food getting worse,
you’re just not
connecting the dots.


Do you think a few signs
and some catchy slogans
are going to somehow
stop global trade?
Well, see, we have no problem
with so-called free trade
<i>as long as it's no!
at the expense</i>
of our human values.
Yes?
Because of the WTO's
legally binding laws...
Thank you so much.
That was great.
Michael, let's roll.
Pine and Fifth.
Good luck, man.

Put your head back.
Put your head back.
It hurts, man.
It burns.
Put your head back.
Come on, come on.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
Come on.
Tilt your head back.
Okay, everyone,
this is what I've heard.
There are protesters
at the end of Sixth Avenue,
so you'll be let out
right in the middle
of the protest, okay?
Now, I've called and asked
for immediate updates.
They said, "Just relax.
Have lunch."
<i>
WTO Director-General
Michael Moore says</i>
<i>an effort to launch</i> a <i>new round
of global trade talks...</i>
<i>
207, please.</i>
<i>
Has not been derailed.</i>
<i>
This conference
will be</i> a <i>success.</i>
Indeed, it's doomed to succeed.
<i>I! is our biggest chance
to provide the conditions</i>
<i>for the next century's
trading regime.</i>
Can I get water
and whiskey, please?
Absolutely.

Shut 'em down!

<i>II</i>


What?
Sir, Hoffa Jr.'s agreed.
Ah.
Uh, uh, sir...

Governor?
Yeah, I've got some good news.
The White House is giving Labor
a seat at the negotiating table.
They won't be joining
the protest downtown.
<i>
Well, that's</i> a <i>bonus,
but we have other problems.</i>
I have the Secret Service
all over me,
<i>and they're saying action
must be taken immediately.</i>
<i>Look, I'm under
extreme pressure here</i>
to call in the Guard now.
The protesters are nonviolent.
You bring in the National Guard,
the whole community's
gonna become alarmed.
<i>Jim, I have the Secretary
of State confined to</i> a <i>hotel...</i>
<i>I have the While House
pressuring me</i>
to call a state of emergency.
I understand that,
but right now,
we simply cannot do that.
They'll clash with
the entire Labor march.
<i>And that?! make
our problems now</i>
seem like a walk in the park.
We cannot call in
the National Guard now.
Are you prepared to handle this?
Because we have a potential
catastrophe on our hands.
Just-John, John,
listen, please, okay?
Just give the police some time.
They'll be effective.
Just give me a few more hours.
Okay, I'm giving you two hours,
and that's it.

- Sir?
- What?
The WTO ceremonies have
just been cancelled, so...
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Yes! It worked!
It worked!
<i>There were so many people.</i>
<i>Where did all these people
come from?</i>
<i>It was like</i> a <i>Thriller video.</i>
I mean, they were coming
out the garbage can,
out of the ground.
Welcome to the first
internet protest in history.
Think Labor's ready
to join this party'?
Come on, Labor.

Hey, give me that.
<i>Don'! go that way.</i>
<i>We need you downtown.</i>
That's what we were told to do,
and that's what we're doing.
The man who's chopping down
the redwoods
is the same guy who's destroying
your workers' rights.
We're fighting
for the same thing.

Teamsters and turtles together.
We need you.
Teamsters and turtles together.
Teamsters and turtles together.
Teamsters and turtles together.
Gordon, what's going on?
Are we making any progress
out there?
We just got reports back
our boys are seeing
Labor marches
all over downtown.
Away from the designated
march route?
Well, how the hell
did that happen?
We don't know yet.
What do you mean
you don't know?
Labor promised to march back
to Memorial Stadium.
I know.
Just find out
what's going on, will ya?
<i>
The demonstration
caused the cancellation</i>
<i>of the conference's
opening ceremonies,</i>
<i>bu! the plenary session,</i>
<i>the real business meeting
of the conference...</i>
Fuck!
<i>
Got under way almost on time.</i>
The TV crew's pulled out.
They said they were
covering the protests.

Aw, you should
just get pregnant.
Come on, we always said
we'd do it together.
Then I better find
a good sperm bank.
Well, you better hurry up.
I'm five months ahead of you.
I do have something
a little different in mind.
- Lambada, anyone?
- No.
Oh, yeah,
the forbidden dance?
Dale and I were gonna
go to Brazil.
You never told me that.
Yeah; three days
after his dad died,
he came back from some park
he had been to and said,
"Let's just quit our jobs.
Let's go traveling."
He even started
buying guidebooks.
Two weeks later,
I found out I was pregnant,
Dale got promoted,
and we just never
talked about it again.
I just wish that it was
better timing, you know'?
There's never a good time;
you just do it,
<i>and it's right.</i>
I just-l feel like my life
is being shuffled
into this next phase,
and I-l don't feel
quite ready for it.
I mean, I don't want the cover
of some brochure magazine
to be the closest thing
we ever get to adventure.
You want adventure?
You just signed up for
the biggest adventure of all.
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>
You?! see.
Maybe I will go visit
a sperm bank.
But if you're going there,
you don't have to.
Ooh, that would be better,
wouldn't it?

What are you doing?
This woman is pregnant.
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna have a kid?
Yeah.
<i>Would you wan! your kid
to Work to death in a sweatshop</i>
making baby clothes?
Of course not.
Then don't fucking shop here!
What the hell's going on
out there?
<i>
What the fuck?</i>
I know we asked you
not to do this shit today.
I didn't promise you
anything.
I didn't get in your way,
so you stay out of mine.
Our message is just
as valid as yours.
Take the fucking mask off
and join the rest of us.
<i>
Are you fucking kidding me?</i>
Are you a fucking moron, man?
You're ruining everything
we've worked for.
Now, we stopped them today.
And what about tomorrow?
And frankly,
I don't give a fuck
what it is
you accomplished today.
I'm not just gonna lay down
and say, "Peace and love,"
and, "Can I stick a flower
in the barrel of
your machine gun, piggy?"
The streets of Seattle
have descended into chaos
as violent demonstrators
are smashing shop windows.
You understand me?
What the hell
are we waiting on?
This is
a nonviolent protest.
And that's not violent!
<i>Do you see anybody
getting hurt?</i>
We attack
corporate America.
That's not the point!
The media's
feasting on this.
Exactly. We are the ones
making this day famous.
Are you blind?
You're feeding them.
You're giving them
exactly what they want.
You call that anarchy?
You're just pissed 'cause you're
not getting enough attention,
sweetheart.
- Ah!
- No!
Nonviolence, huh?
Fuck you!
- Stop!
<i>
Get off of me!</i>
- Stop, Lou.
- What do you know, huh?
You're just trying
to run this show
without even getting
your hands dirty.
Look, you know
nothing about me.
I've been around men like you
my whole life.
You're a fucking coward, Jay.
Lou.
- Fuck off.
- Lou!
Excuse me.
Why do you believe violence
is the best way
to get your message across?
Oh, you want to know my message?
I want to you to stop spreading
corporate-controlled
disinformation around the globe
and start covering
the real issues,
like why this fucking world
is being raped by guys
that make $500 million a year
while the rest
of the world starves.
Why don't you put that
on the 9:00 news?
And we're cut.
Do you want me
to keep the tape?
What do you think?
They breaking shit,
and we're running
from civilians.
Supp
y's almost out of teargas;
we need to regroup.
Regroup or not, this is
a bad message to send, man.
<i>We look fucking useless.</i>
If you want to be useful,
Johnson,
you can be the one
to resupply the gas.
Now, we got a van
heading upstate to restock.
Don't smile at me, boy.
Now, go get changed
and bring your civilian clothes.
I don't want to hear
any more lip.
We got to move and move fast;
we got a problem a block down.
Let's go! Come on.

<i>I</i> Where those treetops glisten <i>I</i>
<i>I</i> And children listen <i>I</i>
<i>I</i> To hear sleigh bells
in the snow <i>I</i>
<i>I The snow I</i>
<i>I</i> Then l, l, I am dreaming
of a white Christmas <i>I</i>
<i>I</i> With every Christmas card
I write <i>I</i>
<i>I Do-do, do-do-do I</i>
<i>May your days, may your days,
may your days</i>
<i>I</i> Be merry and bright <i>I</i>
<i>I</i> And may all your Christmases
be white <i>I</i>

<i>
You asked for</i> a <i>few hours,
and I gave it to you.</i>
And they've remained nonviolent.
Nonviolent does not mean
law-abiding.
<i>If we had called
in the National Guard</i>
<i>when I requested,
Seattle wouldn't be</i>
in every goddamn newspaper
around the globe.
We got taken by surprise, Jim.
Now it's time
to take control back.
The National Guard
won't be here until tomorrow.
And that is why calling
a state of emergency
and imposing a curfew
is our only option.
Are you out of your mind?
You're gonna turn downtown
into a war zone.
Have you been outside lately?
It looks like Beirut!

In 12 hours, the president
of the United States
is gonna be landing here.
He has already called
and threatened to cancel,
and that is not gonna happen.
<i>Do you understand?</i>
His arrival will signal
a return to normalcy, right?
Are we agreed?


And then the window just—
it just-
it just smashed behind us.
It was terrifying.
I mean,
I'm still shaken up by it.

Do you smell that?
Whatever that is,
it's not natural.
God.
- Can you taste that?
- Yes.


Hey.
<i>
Hey, sweetheart,
where are you?</i>
I'm at work.
<i>Look, I want you
to go home now.</i>
<i>H's gelling crazy downtown.
Get out now, okay?</i>
Okay. Okay, well,
we'll get there-
<i>Ella.</i>

Dale, I got to call you back.
<i>
Are you okay?</i>
<i>
Ella, Karla, we have to-</i>
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Okay,
just take a breath.
Due to the street protests,
we are closing the store
immediately.
All customers must vacate
the premises now.
Thank you.
Close it up here, okay?

<i>
Do you know where
the next move is in the city?</i>
Afternoon.

<i>It is my unfortunate duty
today to have to tell you</i>
that I am authorizing
the use of the National Guard.
I am also-
I'm also declaring
a state of emergency
in Seattle
from this moment forth.
There will be a curfew imposed
from 7:00 p.m. tonight
until 7:30 a.m. tomorrow morning
in downtown Seattle.
These actions
are unavoidable
in light of recent
property destruction.
Yes.
<i>
Mr. Mayor,
there have been rumors</i>
<i>that you knew what to expect</i>
and yet you were
still unprepared
<i>for today's events.</i>
- <i>We had full-</i>
- <i>Can you comment?</i>
We had full knowledge
of the protester's aims
and decided
that freedom of speech
and the right to assembly
would be celebrated today.
<i>
Mr. Mayor.</i>
<i>
Why wasn't the National Guard
called in earlier?</i>
We believed that a show of force
would make
the circumstances worse.
We did not want
to present Seattle
with the face of an armed camp
as the WTO did its work.
<i>
Any comment on police violence
and retaliation?</i>
Some of the protesters
chose to be unlawful.
The police responded
appropriately.
Thank you.
<i>
Mr. Mayor,
ism declaring mama! law</i>
<i>and keeping the protesters</i>
<i>in violation of
the First Amendment rights?</i>
Halt.
<i>
We are ordering you
to immediately disperse.</i>
<i>Otherwise,
you')! be the subject</i>
<i>of chemical
and pain compliance.</i>
Comply immediately.
<i>
We are peaceful protestors</i>
exercising free speech.
We ask that you do not take away
our constitutional rights.
Chemical disbursement...
We are peaceful protestors
exercising...
You have ten minutes to comply.

We need two more,

There's no buses

Well, how are you supposed
to get home?
Hey, Gabby.
Hey, do you mind if I stop
by your place for a while?

<i>
Get the gas ready.</i>
<i>
Peaceful protest.</i>
This is your final warning.
Stand by.
Be all right?
<i>
Yeah.</i>
<i>
Take this for me.</i>
Thank you.
Here, put this on.
Do you have one?
Do you have one?
No, no, I'm all right.

How are you guys?
I'm on the job.
- Hold up. Hold up.
- I'm on the job.
Guys, guys,
let him through.
Are you all right?
Where you been?
We got restocked hours ago.

What happened to your face?
It's a long story.
Ah, what the fuck
is this shit.
Careful. We've been using
that as a porta potty.
There's some bottles
you don't want to knock over.
Ah, these bottles,
that's great.
And bullshit.
We haven't had a break or food
since we woke up.
I'm sick of this.
Oh, incoming.
<i>
What?</i>
They've been looking for you.
Dale.
Yeah?
<i>Your wife's in the hospital.</i>
Let's go ahead and prep
trauma one and two.
<i>
The group just continued
destroying property,</i>
<i>vandalizing cars,
creating havoc.</i>
<i>The police were nowhere
to be found.</i>
<i>About an hour after that,
the group was back in action...</i>
<i>But for us to have
to close our stores</i>
<i>during the peak season,</i>
<i>the holiday Christmas season
just beginning,</i>
<i>really is an injustice.</i>
<i>
They're breaking the bank's
windows here at U.S. Bank.</i>
<i>We go! to get out of here...</i>
<i>
A group we now know
as Anarchist...</i>
<i></i>
<i>
The battle in Seattle
turns into</i> a <i>war.</i>
Jesus Christ.

Battle in Seattle?
It sounds like
a monster truck show.
They turned us into
icons of violence.
Well,
what do you expect?
What did I expect?
I mean, eight corporations
own half the U.S. media.
You know that.
Then what the fuck
are we doing this for?
I'm sorry.
Jay, please.
If you want to leave again,
then just leave.
That's not fair.
This is hard for me.
We shut them down,
and look what they did to us.
<i>We failed, Jay.</i>
You only fail when you quit.
Oh, fuck you.
I wanted justice
for your brother
as much as you did,
but we never
would have won that case.
Oh, how would you know?
You gave up on it.
I gave up because I knew
we didn't stand a chance.
Oh, like now.
Yeah.
Okay, you're right.
Okay, maybe we wouldn't
have won back then,
but we still have
a chance now,
okay?
And I understand;
if you don't to protest,
you don't want to be part
of the legal team, that's fine,
but maybe you
could be a medic.
Look, I-
I know you want
to make a difference.
Yeah, I do.
But how do you stop those
who will stop at nothing?
You don't stop.
Who brought my wife in?
She's right
over there, sir.
Excuse me. You came in
with my wife, Ella.
- Yes.
- What happened?
She was attacked
by police.
Thank you.
<i>Ella.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>
How are you?
What happened?

<i>What?</i>

<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.</i>
- It's okay.
- Baby.
It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay now.
Get off me.
It's me, baby.
It's me.
Get off of me.

<i></i>
<i>Baby?</i>
Dale, don't.

Yesterday,
the protest spotlight
was supposed to have been
on Labor
and its critique of the WTO,
but by the time the Labor march
was ending,
the confrontations on the street
were heating up,
and Labor's message
was all but drowned out.
Last night, in an effort
to finally clear the streets...
Why more arrests
weren't made.
Many protesters had trained
in civil disobedience,
expecting, some even hoping,
they would be arrested.
Seattle police chief
said last night
that he had never been
more proud of his officers,
and he defended their actions.
Our police officers,
in my judgment,
did an extraordinary job today
against all odds.

All right, something tells me
they're not gonna be as friendly
as they were yesterday.

You look like
you're going somewhere.
So do you.
<i>
Jay.</i>
Yo.
This'll get you in.
Knock 'em dead, champ.
Come on.
- All right.
- Bad tie.
<i>
I'll give it to you
when I get back.</i>
Good luck.
I need more tear gas.
Yesterday, we ran out
in four hours.
I don't care what
they say downtown, all right?
Lieutenant,
do you have a moment?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, Dale.
Ah, sir, I need to request
permission to go home.
L-I need to be
with my wife today.
Yeah, Dale, look, I heard about
what happened with your wife.
I'm sorry.
I know this is
a bad time for you,
but I need you
out on the street.
Sir, I am not right
to go out there today.
No, no, every man
is important out there.
Look, when this thing's over,
I'll give you off
all the time you want.
Okay?

Patients are dying
not because their diseases
are incurable,
but because, as consumers,
they do not provide
a viable market
for pharmaceutical products.
<i>I believe the WTO</i>
must review its TRIPS agreements
so that public health comes
before commercial interests.
It is vital to the survival
of millions of people.
Thank you.

<i>
I'm sure we all agree</i>
that Doctors Without Borders
have done many great things.
<i>However,
on the issue of patents,</i>
<i>we believe they're</i>
a <i>little misguided.</i>
Who's that?
It's Mark Harrington.
He's a major lobbyist
for the pharmaceutical industry.
Many of these nations are
embroiled in bloody civil wars.
Let's go.
They lack the basic
infrastructures,
such as clean water
and sewage treatment.
Now, it is these that lead
inevitably to a health crisis
<i>no matter how much medicine
is made available to them.</i>
Doctor, your industry
as well as ours is dedicated
<i>to maintaining
and preserving health.</i>
Thank you.

Uh, excuse-
Um, excu—
Excuse me.
I just wanted
to congratulate the WTO
and particularly congratulate
Mr. Lovitz there.
It's because of Mr. Lovitz
and the WTO's effort
at eliminating trade tariffs
on lumber products
<i>that two million acres
of forest</i>
are being destroyed
and cut down,
<i>and on top of that,</i>
irreplaceable trees
are being turned into profit
by people like you.
And I want you to know,
Mr. Lovitz,
<i>that my brother's blood
is on your hands.</i>
It's on your hands,
you motherfucker.
You fucking murderer.
Help!
My brother's been hurt.
My brother's been hurt.
You murdered my brother.
<i>My bro river's been-</i>
Call an ambulance!

Ain‘t no power like

<i>
Do you ever wonder what
those horses feel like about</i>
<i>teargas and all that
type of stuff?</i>
They don't give them
no mask.
No, but I do wonder how you stay
so upbeat all the time.
Animals, working with animals
instead of humans.
Way healthier.
Next time
we save some turtles,
you should come along
with us.
- I think I'd like that.
-Yeah.
Why turtles?
When I was a little kid,
my grandfather,
he told me this cool story
about how all the animals,
you know, they made fun
of this one little turtle
because he was different.
You know,
he couldn't defend hisself,
so of course,
they picked on him.
But being he was a turtle,
he was smart.
So he developed
this hard shell,
and that only made
the animals mad,
so they picked him up,
threw him in the river,
and then he broke his shell
into, like, a dozen pieces.
Poor turtle.
<i>Yeah, they go! him good,
but he was tough.</i>
<i>You know,
he picked hisself back up;</i>
put himself back together.
And even though, you know,
this time his shell was cracked,
it was stronger than ever,
and that's why turtles
have such beautiful patterns
on their shells.
And then what happened?
Well, because of the WTO,
they made him into an ashtray.
That's fucked up, Django.
Yeah.
Fucked-up world.
Wait, so let me
get this straight.
Yesterday, we're not supposed
to arrest anybody
<i>and today we're supposed
to arrest everybody.</i>
<i>
Johnson, order them
to disperse.</i>
If they don't, arrest them.
<i>Understand?</i>
<i>
Get in</i> a <i>line. Let's go.</i>
<i>
Peaceful protest.
Peaceful protest.</i>
<i>
Da!e.</i>
Hey.

Baby, it's me.
Listen, I just wanted to say...
I don't know what to say.
<i>
Dale, get off the phone.
Come on. Let's go.</i>
Uh, I got to go.
I just-l-
I'll try to call you later.
I love you, baby.
<i>'L</i>
The story is a lot bigger
than a few people dressed
in black breaking windows.
<i>Eric, the news is right here.</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>
Listen to me, Eric.
Just listen to me.
No, you listen, Jean.
In one hour, Clinton's giving
a press conference.
<i>You are going live.</i>
<i>You screw this up,</i>
<i>and we are gonna have
major problems.</i>
- Got it?
- Got it.
Asshole.
What do you want to do?
Let's just stick around
a little bit.
Fuckin' asshole.
Peaceful protest.
Peaceful protest.
Peaceful protest.
<i>Peaceful protest.</i>
<i>Peaceful protest.</i>
<i>Peaceful protest.</i>
<i>Peaceful protest.</i>
<i>Peaceful protest.</i>
<i>
This is your first
and last warning.</i>
<i>I need you to disperse.</i>
<i>Just stand up and leave.</i>
<i>Otherwise we will force you
to leave.</i>
<i>I'm no! gonna say I! again.</i>
<i>We need you to stand up
and leave.</i>
<i>
Stand by.</i>
<i>
Peaceful protest.</i>

Deploy.

Get your knee off my neck.
I am not resisting.
I am a nonviolent protester.
I am a nonviolent protester.
The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching.

How the hell do they
keep doing it?
What?
How do they keep on
putting themselves
on the line like that
for a cause they can't win?
'Cause they believe
they can win.
Stop the van.
Jean, the Clinton conference
is in, like, five minutes.
Michael, I need you to forget
about the Clinton thing.
And forget about
the live broadcast?
No. We're still going live.
You know what that'll mean,
right?
President Clinton had arrived
at Boeing Field in the middle
of the night.
We now know the Secret Service
considered canceling the visit
until they got assurances
the president would be safe.
Coming up, we have
Jean Asbury reporting live
from the president's
press conference.
Jean.
We're set up
and ready to go.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
They want to keep
the truth gagged?
So be it.
Jean.
We're going live
to the battle in Seattle
with Jean on the scene.
What the fuck does she think
she's doing?
Cut the transmission,
and go to the studio.
<i>
What? Right now?</i>
- <i>Now!</i>
- <i>Jim, you're on.</i>
Well, that was Jean Asbury
there in Seattle
showing us the tactics that
protesters are resorting to.
We'll be right back
after this break.
I just, uh,
want to say...


Thanks.
Yeah, she's gonna have
to call you back.

<i>II</i>
The creation of this
African Caucus group
is essential
if we are to maintain...

A united voice against
industrialized nations.
What's going on?

What's happening?
Where are you going?
<i>
I'm sorry, Mr. Abasi,</i>
<i>bu! due to an unscheduled
Labor meeting,</i>
we need all available
interpreters.
An unscheduled meeting
takes precedence over us?
<i>As host, we do reserve
the right to determine</i>
how our resources
are allocated.
<i>We can arrange
for interpreters to be here</i>
<i>some other time.</i>
And I will accept lots
of criticisms about the WTO
and how we can improve
what we do.
But one criticism
I will not accept,
and that is that this house
in some way is not democratic.
There are ministers from
all over the world assembled.
There are ministers who are
appointed by their presidents
or elected
by their parlI aments.





90% of all death and suffering
from infectious disease
occurs in the Third World.
I'm sorry, I have to-
14 million people die
every year.
So many could be saved
if medicines were cheaper,
<i>bu! they are simply
too expensive</i>
for developing nations
to afford
due to patent protection laws.

Stop. Please stop.
Don't you have children?
How would you feel
if your child was sick,
you knew there was a cure,
but you couldn't afford it,
so you must stand by
and watch your child die?
You people, right here...
You have a power
to make a difference.
<i>Isn't I! time</i>
that people mattered
more than profit?


<i>I</i> Here's a little song
I wrote <i>I</i>
<i>I</i> Everybody,
sing it note for note <i>I</i>
<i>I</i> Don't worry <i>I</i>
<i>I Be happy I</i>
<i>I</i> Don't worry,

<i>I Dooo-doo-doo-do-do I</i>

Come on, y'all.
I mean, this ain't
the end of the world.
We're just getting
locked up.
Well, at least, it ain't
the end of the world yet.
You're being
way too quiet on me.
Something happened
with you and Jay, right?
What do you mean?
Oh, you know,
Django know.
You know,
I see everything.
I saw that little look
he gave you.
What look?
"What look."
You know, that look.
I mean, I ain't seen him
give that look in a long time.
I didn't see no look.
<i>Okay, well, okay,
!ain't seen no wok either.</i>
<i>You know, maybe it was just,</i>
you know, the tear gas
and all that type of stuff
messing my eyes UP-
Then he almost gets arrested
trying to save you and Sam,
and that ain't cool;
he cannot get locked up.
God forbid.
Hell, yeah.
I mean, I like making fun of him
too much to see him gone.
What do you mean, "gone"?
<i>They go! two strikes
against him.</i>
<i>He get one more,
he is out of here.</i>
<i>I mean, for life;
no joke.</i>
Didn't he tell you?
No, he didn't.
Ah, yeah.
I mean, '98, IMF;
'97, the whole forest thing.
The boy got some nuts
on him, though,
even if they are organic nuts.

They some nuts.

Come on, y'all.
Tough crowd.
Forced from downtown by police
as curfew descends,
an angry crowd of demonstrators
mixed with residents
are near Broadway
and Pine Street.
Go home to your wife,
to your kids.
Police patience
finally runs out.

The battle
for Capitol Hill begins.
Police retake Capitol Hill,
but some say amid the tear gas
<i>and rubber bullets,
they have lost credibility.</i>
<i>For many, the violent climax
of the battle for Capitol Hill</i>
<i>is the last straw.</i>
Be ready for
a long vacation.
<i>
This is not</i> a <i>police state!</i>
<i>
The last group was pushed past
the Paramount Theatre,</i>
<i>up Pine Street,
all the way to Capitol Hill.</i>

- Fuck, man.
- What the hell?
Son of a bitch.
Shit, man.
They put piss in it.
Go home!
They put fucking-
Get up there,
all right?
You can shower later.
Get up there now.
Son of a bitch!
<i>
Stand back.</i>
Where the fuck
is everybody?
Haven't you done enough?
<i>You're the ones
making this violent.</i>
<i>This was a peaceful protest.</i>
Yeah, come on!
Stand back!
Why are you so proud
of yourself?
Come on,
you fucking cowards.
<i>Oh, you think you're so brave</i>
<i>now that there's only
six of you?</i>

Dale, what you doing, man?
We got to wait for backup.
I'm doing my job.
Come on. He's just a kid.
<i>Would you shoot your own kid?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>
Would you should your own kid
or use a fucking nightstick?
<i>Huh?</i>
Take this.
What?
Dale, what the fuck
are you doing?


Hey!
Hey, hey,
I'm not in service.
What?
<i>
Open the fucking door.</i>
Son of a bitch!

Hey, get off him.
<i>Le! I! go.
Let it go.</i>
<i>Le! I! go.
Let it go.</i>
Hey, look at me.
It's over. Let it go.

Hey, you all right?
Come here.
Look at me. Look at me.
Oh, fuck.
Just lay there for a second.
Please, don't arrest-
<i>don'! arrest me.</i>
<i>
Can you walk?</i>
<i>
Don't arrest me.</i>
Don't arrest me.
Come on, man,
get up.
<i></i>
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Ge! up.</i>

No, please.
Put your hands behind
your back, please.
Oh, no.
I'm begging you.
<i>An right.
We got 'em.</i>


Where's everybody going?
There are hundreds of us
in jail.
What about them?
This isn't over yet.
You can't just leave them there.
We can't leave them there
to rot.
And what are we supposed to do?
Look, I'm gonna have to get
a fucking hamburger.
Every one of our lawyers
are in here?
That's what I heard.
Who's gonna get us out?
Anybody hear anything
about Jay?
Nobody's seen
or heard from him.
<i>Until they let us talk
with somebody on the outside,</i>
we have no idea
what we're dealing with.

<i>
All jewelry, your wallet.</i>
I'm gonna need the cigarettes
and the phone too.
All personal belongings
must be handed in.
Let's go.
<i>
Take it easy man. !'m-</i>
<i>
Shut up!</i>
Step to your right.
<i>
What the fuck you looking at?</i>

Excuse me,
can I make a phone call?
No. Sit down.
Look, I have the number
right here.
Do you understand
what "no" means?
One call.
When you decide
to give us your name,
then we'll give you
your rights.
Jay?
<i>Jay?</i>
Jay!
<i>What the fuck
have you done to him?</i>
You fricking pigs!
<i>Is that what happens when you
exercise your civil liberties .7</i>
<i>
Miss Clayton .7</i>
<i>The mayor will see you now.</i>

Have a seat.
<i>It's a big responsibility
you have,</i>
handling, what is it,
600 people?
600 innocent people,
Mr. Mayor.
I'll be the first to admit
that mistakes were made,
but those protesters are in jail
because they broke the law.
You and I both know
you're incarcerating people
who will never stand trial.
This is a file of
many of the known protesters
who are in jail.
<i>If they agree
that for two years</i>
<i>they won'! demonstrate,</i>
they'll be released immediately.
They'll never agree
to having their civil liberties
<i>taken away any more
than they already have been.</i>
Neither will I, Mr. Mayor.
Well, I think you should
give them the choice, don't you,
considering the consequences?
Which are exactly?
<i>Your clients</i>
are in a precarious situation,
especially those
with criminal records.
First of all,
court rules have been violated
by not providing prisoners
with access to counsel.
Second, access to counsel
is not contingent
on answering police questions,
including, "What is your name?"
<i>And lastly,</i>
you don't have the resources
to provide a jury
and a public defender
to everyone in that jail,
so let's not bother
bluffing anymore.
<i>I want my clients freed
with no fines,</i>
<i>no restitution orders,</i>
and no criminal charges.
It's hard to help your clients
if they won't talk.
Well, their voices must
have been taken away
when their rights were.
Okay.
I want to see the prisoners now.
Well, I suggest you come back
in a couple of days
when it's quieter.
Thank you.
Let them go!
Doesn't look like
it's gonna get much quieter...
Especially for you, Mr. Mayor.
Thank you.

<i>
Ella?
Dale's on the phone again.</i>
<i>Ella?</i>
Just tell him I'll be back
in a couple of days.

<i></i>
<i></i>
Jay?

Jay, are you okay?
<i>
Guess I'm not gonna be able
to rescue you after all.</i>

Yeah.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
I didn't know.
What?

<i>H's okay.
Hey, hey.</i>
I didn't know
you had it in you too.
<i>What?</i>
That voice.
<i>The one that tells you</i>
<i>that if you don't stand up
and fight,</i>
<i>everything that's beautiful
is gonna be taken away.</i>
I just want to run away.
Oh.
<i></i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
Hey.
Hey.

<i>Lou, give me your hand.</i>
You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
You're crying
like a girl.


Come on, tough girl.
<i>
We Want you to know...</i>
<i>
We Want you to know...</i>
You are not alone.
You are not alone.
People are protesting with us...
People are protesting with us...
In 30 cities across the world.

We'll all stay with you...

We'll all stand with you...</i>

Until you're released.</i>

I'm sorry, sir.
I think you want
to turn on the TV,
<i>Channel 7.</i>
<i>
And huge protest crowds</i>
<i>stiff growing at the-jail
are creating...</i>

How you doing?
I came to apologize.
I was way out of line.
My wife and I lost our baby.
<i>I know that's no excuse,
but I just-that's-</i>
I'm really sorry.
Really, really, really sorry.
And so...

I don't blame you.
I mean, I do, but...
Shit, you're not the problem.
<i>I mean, you're just
doing your job, I guess.</i>
<i>And the people that
I'm really trying to fight,</i>
<i>you know, are the ones
that destroy so much...</i>
And they hurt so many lives.
I'm not just one.
<i>There are literally millions,</i>
<i>and nobody ever
points a gun at them.</i>
<i>You know, they just seem so</i>
unaccountable...
Untouchable.
It just seems kind of fucked
that you're...

You and me are the ones
that have to fight each other.
<i>
At least 1,000 protesters
marched and sang.</i>
<i>
Am 't no power
like the power of the people</i>
<i>'cause the power
of the people don't stop.</i>


<i>
Sir.</i>
The Labor Council
is threatening a general strike
if the jailed protesters
aren't released.
General strike?
Yes, sir.
<i>
The protesters are demanding</i>
<i>the release of 500 or so
protesters behind bars.</i>
<i>
Let them go. Let them go.</i>

Tell me I'm hallucinating.
You are not here right now.
You all right?
We'll get out of here.

Don't-don't worry-
don't worry.
We'll get out of here.
What? What?
What Django always say?
Don't, man.
Come on.
What does Django always say?
Don't.
Slow and steady
wins the race every time.
What the fuck
have we won, Django?
Have a look
around you, man.
Look, I know
it's hard right now,
but you got to-
you got to stick with it, man.
I mean, your brother's up there
rooting for you,
rooting for all of us.
Come on, man.
I mean, besides,
a week ago,
nobody knew what the hell
the WTO was.
Now they still don't know
what the WTO is, but...

At least they know
it's bad, you know?
Yes.
How long have we been trying
to save this planet?
Ah...
Not long enough.
Yeah, it's still
quite a mess, huh?
Oh, yeah.

I love you.
At the beginning of this week,
we came here with hope
in our hearts
to try and find better solutions
for our countries.
We were promised these rounds
would be different
from the last time,
that our trade concerns
would be heard.
But we have been treated
like no more than animals.
The manipulation
of third-world countries
is simply another form
of colonialism.

You may try to silence me,
but I will have my say.
<i>Like the protesters
outside of this building,</i>
I will be heard!
We have been blindsided
and marginalized
on issues of vital importance.
<i>Transparency and openness
have not existed here.</i>
Therefore, we will not
join the consensus required
to meet the objectives
of this conference.
No more will we stand idly by
as our countries
are abused and exploited!

<i>
The people united
will never be defeated.</i>
The people united
will never be defeated.
Everybody on the inside...
Everybody on the inside...
<i>
We have two messages for you...</i>
We have two messages for you...
That we think you're gonna like.
<i>
That we think
you're gonna like.</i>
<i>
The first message reads...</i>
<i>
The first message reads...</i>
A complete collapse...
A complete collapse...
Of the WTO talks.
Of the WTO talks.

Did you hear that'?
Did you hear that'?
It happened, man.

Little by little.
I told you.
<i>There will be no new
Millennium Round of trade talks</i>
<i>for the World Trade
Organization.</i>
<i>We'll be back a! 6:00 tonight
for more breaking news.</i>

The second message...
The second message...
You're gonna like this one, Jay.
<i>
You're gonna like
this one, Jay.</i>
All prisoners will be released.
All prisoners will be released.
- Yes!
- Ha-ha-ha!


Yeah!
Where are you going
in such a hurry?
<i>L</i> got to go-
Are you running away?
<i>
And I want to see
y'all next year,</i>
April 16th, IMF.

All right.
Drinks on me.

What the hell
are you doing here?
Well, it's nice
to see you too.
One down,
a million more to go.

Whoo! Ha-ha!
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
What's your last name?
You are a cop, aren't you?
