Like most living creatures,
pigeon quickly associate
to press the buton.
But when, the time recycles automatically
every 20 seconds,
the pigeon wonders:
Why did I deserve this?
And starts to move his wings,
continue to see esential
influences what happens.
We call this:
"Pigeon's superstition''
MR. NOBODY
Why did I deserve this?
How you been since
last time?
- Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.
I am Dr. Flite.
- And who are you?
- Nobody. Nemo Nobody.
It's an unusual name, right?
Sometimes people call me Mr. Craft
Craft cant remember
not a damn thing.
What was the first question
I asked you.
- I dont know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?
I am 34
I was born in 1975.
Would you mind looking at your hands?
You dont have to, if you want.
There's a mirror in front of you
What year is this?
I am 34
I was born in february 1975
So I guess it should be
your birthday
<i>The last mortal turns  118 </ i></i>
I am 34.
I want to wake up
I'm sick of waking up!
Dont Nemo, it hurts my eyes.
Hey friend

Esras tired I must rest.

The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?
The sun hurts my eyes.
This is Gigin Marshall,
live from hospital.
Where we see the last episode
of our series, "'The last mortal''
Mr. Nobody has 117 years
and has nothing.
You dont have these adorable
compatible pigs.
Live on the chain,
will last human dies
natural old-age.
Now doctor, is not found
records of identity.
Nothing about his past.
We do not know who is Mr. Nobody
No
memories remain unclear,
is not abnormal for their age
His old memories come
in great detail
let's try something new
I think of an old technique
No promises
Maybe memories
matrices become
Maybe nothing happens
Be willing to try?
This relaxed
Just listen to my voice
her eyelids grow heavy
His arms and legs
grow heavy
I'll count to three
When I say three
Be asleep
One
two
Remember the day I came here
Three
This sleeping
Remember the back
when you say three
One, two three
Remember
I can not remember much
before my birthday
And even were not born
When not born yet
know everything, everything will happen
When you get time
angels of the living
They put a finger in your mouth
That on this
Means you have forgotten everything
But forget my angel
Then you have to find
Mommy and Daddy is not easy to choose
Blond and blue ojoz
is all what I ordered
It would be nice to not be alone
It is normal for babies to choose
for women at least
And not finished yet, dear.
Not that we do not want a child
Is an important experience
I think it would help my husband
if we have a child
No george?
ultimately chose them?
because the woman smells good
and the man said
I can tell you how we met
It was fate
Give heard butterfly effect?
Once upon a time there was a
Mommy and Daddy
then they found a
cute baby
And they called Bebito
the baby came out of there
born this day
and no other
Daddy is the day
and Mommy, 7
Everything exists
We could see
I could see mom's eyes
but could not see my eyes
the baby could see his hands
But there was himself
so really there?
I really exist?
My mother taught me
choose the best
and here these
the mom brushed her hair
and lipstick
It smelled good, had his watch Daddy
put it in your arm
The clock to Tik Tok
if the baby fell
mother applauded
bravo said
Why me? and not another?
and we will have clear skies
throughout the weekend
Hello.
Why could not remember the past
but not the future?
When I preguntba Mommy
I said, stop asking why?
It's complicated
Okay, I'm a journalist
interviews allowed us
I just wanted to make a spreguntas
A friend works here
helped me get
What time is it?
14 and 12
Where can I get that?
- I give the University Museum
Even works
I have nothing to tell you
I am Mr. Nobody
a man who never existed
Remember how the world was
before crossing the immortality?
What?
- What happened
How it was when humans
were mortal?
There were cars and pollution
Smoked cigarettes
we ate lunch
We did everything we could
in this wonderful
Most of the time
nothing happened
As a French film
And sex? before
sex was obsolete?
Everyone always
was pulling
We fell in love
What time is it?
How was before the big bang?
There was before because before
from this
TIMP never existed
time is the result of
expansion of the universe itself
but what about when the Universe
stops expanding?
and the movement is back
what will be the natural time?
If string theory and correct
the universe posse
9-dimensional space
And a temporary dimensioón
We can imagine that in the beginning
all the universes were mixed
there during the big bang
3 spaces universes
what we know as high, down
and death
and a temporal dimension
time is
The other six remained together
And if we live in a universe
of bound
how to distinguish between
Illusion and reality?
Time as we know it is a
universe in which we experience
only in one direction
but if the universe
not space
but temporarily
If you mix the mashed ppa
and tomato
Really it's forever.
cigar smoke out of Dad
but never re-enter
We can not return
that is why it is difficult
You have to make the right choice
While not choose
anything is a possibility
