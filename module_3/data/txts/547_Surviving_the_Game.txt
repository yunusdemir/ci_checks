Mingo!
There he is!
-l see him !
-Come on!
-Lookit, l`m bleeding.
-Give me my money.
-What about my money?
-You ruined my clothes.
That`s sixteen dollars.
This is your dog?
Friend of mine, man.
You give me money.
l want my money.
Get off, man.
l just want my dog.
What about my taxi?
Yo, fuck your taxi, man.
You finished?
Come on.
Well, l`m late.
You ever see a burial at sea?
They take a guy...
and they wrap him up
in sailcloth.
They sew him up
with a five-inch shell...
so it goes down,
down the deep six.
You know what l mean?
Poor Mingo.
Jeez.
You have to dig so deep?
Let`s hope somebody digs for me
this deep when l`m gone.
A whole week
after D-day Okinawa...
we didn`t have one solid meal.
Evey time, you know,
they`d blow us to go to chow--
Not a goddamn thing here.
We`re halfway down the ladder,
you know, and...
l`m hungy, God damn it!
-l can tell you that.
-We got to eat soon, man.
Look at this dump.
People are becoming
goddamn rabbits.
Goddamn.
People don`t eat meat anymore.
We got to get something to eat.
All that complaining
ain`t making shit better, man.
We got to get food.
l got a gun.
Come over here, man.
What kind of gun is this?
A Toka...
A gun is a gun, you know.
They--they kill people.
Check the barrel
and don`t point it at me.
What the fuck
are you talking about?
The first thing you do
when you find a gun...
is to check the barrel.
You fire this, you know...
and the barrel`s clogged...
it`ll blow up in your hand.
-Don`t fuck around with that.
-What the fuck you doing?
l can get twenty bucks for this
with or without bullets.
Don`t wory about it.
Forget it ever came up.
Food.
Forget this trash here, man.
l know where we can get
some real food, Hank.
Yeah, l know
where some real food is.
Just don`t tell me any more
of them fucking stories.
You know l don`t chicken out...
but l got a funny feeling
about this.
Come on, Hank, you just got
to trust me, all right?
l know what l`m doing.
Just stay right here.
You`re a fool.
They got watchdogs
all over the place.
l`ve known this dog
longer than l`ve known you.
You never listen to me.
Hey, Hank,
what do you know about this?
Come here, dog.
Yeah, l told you.
Hey, we got enough
for lots of folks!
Well, l finally caught your ass.
We`re just hungy.
Give us a break, will you?
We`ll give it back!
lt`s already contaminated
with your filth.
Somebody`s going to pay.
Leave the old man alone!
Pulling a gun on me, huh?
You going to hurt me?
Hurt you? No, l`m not going
to hurt you at all.
l`m going to kill me
somebody tonight.
You`re right.
Somebody`s going to die tonight.
Yeah.
lt`s going to be you...
maybe all of us.
Let`s all die.
You`re a crazy motherfucker.
l`ll take this stick and ram it
up your ass, make a popsicle.
You ain`t shit.
You like beating up old people?
l can clock you in the head.
Let`s go see the devil.
Would you like that?
Man, get the fuck out of here!
Hey, man, you crazy!
And don`t come back, you hear?
l handled that.
Hop the fence and get the meat.
Aw, go fuck yourself.
Aw, shit.
We want to thank you, mister.
Want help with the fire?
No, that`s all right.
l say something wrong?
lt ain`t your fault.
Now, look, what`s done is done.
Blaming yourself for
what happened two years ago...
won`t change a damn thing.
-Finished?
-No, just starting.
l`m going to get you
on your feet again.
Ain`t nobody ever going to give
a break to nobody like me.
Fuck `em all,
and give yourself one, too.
lt`s up to you to get your life
back on track again...
not nobody else.
No matter what l do, somebody`s
going to knock me down.
Don`t let `em. Once you get
your confidence back...
you fight them
with eveything you got...
to hold on with.
l mean eveything.
You got all this philosophy.
What happened to you?
Aw, shit.
Last time l was on track...
l was still a virgin.
All this food seems to be going
to your head.
You getting sentimental, man.
God`s still constipated.
Get up, Hank.
Shit.
Another fucked-up day.
Get up, Hank!
Oh, man.
You can`t die on me, Hank.
l`ll take one of those bags.
Oh, there`s my buddy, huh?
When did you get out of jail?
Here. God bless you.
You take care of yourself.
Hey, hey, hey!
Don`t you want a free lunch?
No such thing.
Hey, wait!
l only want to help you.
Oh, shit.
What`s wrong with you, man?
Get up!
-Hey, get the fuck off me!
-l`m tying to help you.
-l don`t want your help!
-Don`t kill yourself!
-l`ve been through rough times.
-Like what, your Jacuzzi broke?
-There`s always another way out.
-Like what?
Like letting someone help you.
Why the fuck
would you want to help me?
Because life
has been good to me.
l saw you and thought...
it`s a chance for me
to make a difference to someone.
Why don`t you save that shit
for somebody who gives a fuck?
Look, man, you`re young,
you know? You`re healthy.
You seem intelligent.
Why would you want
to kill yourself?
Maybe l like choosing
when l die.
Don`t you have family,
people who care?
l had a wife and a kid,
and they`re dead.
-lsn`t there anyone else?
-No!
l find that hard to believe!
l don`t want anybody
to care about me.
l don`t want to be responsible
for anybody else`s feelings.
l`m through with this shit.
Hey, let me ask you something!
lf someone offered you
a good job...
something that would be
a real opportunity...
would you be interested?
OK.
Well, if you ever want
to look me up...
l`m at the Seventh Street
Mission evey Thursday.
Yo, hold up, man.
What kind of job
are you talking about?
My business partner and l...
need someone to help us
as a survival guide...
with our hunts
in the wilderness.
l don`t know shit about that.
With my recommendation...
you`ll have a decent chance
of getting the job.
-The pay is good.
-What kind of pay?
How much money exactly, man?
Just go down there.
Talk to this man.
His name`s Burns.
You`ll find out eveything
you need to know.
Can l help you?
Mason.
My partner.
He`s such a...
humanitarian.
Why don`t you come in, please?
Sit down.
No offense, but...
you don`t look like
much of a hunter to me.
l was just getting ready to say
the same thing about you.
l`ve already got the job.
How many cigarettes
do you smoke in a day?
As many as l can get.
l appreciate you coming in...
but the job needs someone
with, uh...
endurance.
l`m afraid your lungs
couldn`t handle it.
That`s it?
Just that quick?
Come on, man, l need this job.
l got endurance.
That`s one of those running
things over there, right?
Turn that on.
Put me on it.
l`ll show you some endurance.
Keep this up for half an hour,
l`ll give you twenty bucks.
For twenty bucks,
l`ll run to fucking Alaska.
Never thought you`d make it.
Never underestimate a man
who ain`t got nothing to lose.
Evey man`s
got something to lose.
Look, just `cause
you got a lot of money...
don`t think you know evey man.
So, how do l get ahold of you
if l need you?
Best hotel in town.
Man, twenty-five years ago...
l married this woman,
this black woman--
voluptuous, pretty,
hair slick on her head.
Six months later,
all that shit was null and void.
l`d get home.
Son would say, ""Get out of bed.""
l get on out the bed--
Boy, who you done robbed?
Just give me a room--one
with a TV that works this time.
You must want
the presidential suite.
l just want what l pay for.
Hey, before you get in that bed,
you wash your nasty ass, boy!
You make sure you wash
your nasty ass!
l get to the kitchen, right?
Mr. Overland
goes to the kitchen...
bitch right behind him.
Son of a bitch.
Go away. l got the room
till twelve o`clock.
l thought you wanted a job.
You cut your hair.
l like to stay in style.
How`d you get the burns?
Playing with matches, all right?
No shit?
l got you some clothes.
They should pretty much fit you.
How in the fuck
would you know what fit me?
Trust me. l`ve been doing this
a long time.
l ain`t doing nothing
unless the money`s right.
We`ll give you a couple of days
to get into the hang of things.
Food and lodging,
we`ll take care of it.
We`ll start you off
on five hundred dollars a week.
Here`s a two-hundred-dollar
advance.
lt`s money.
lf you do well...
we may give you a raise.
l`ll be outside.
l spent quite some time
in third world countries.
lt changed my point of view.
lt`s a clich» to say
that life was cheap there...
but life was way beyond cheap.
l`m glad l got this job,
but l don`t understand...
what it is about hunting animals
that gets you off.
lt`s not about killing.
lt`s not about death.
lt`s about life.
You tell that to the animal.
The animal knows it, too.
This is going to be quite
a learning experience for you.
Whatever, man, whatever.
As long as l`m getting paid,
l could give a fuck.
Where is Hell`s Canyon, anyway?
Where are we at right now?
We just crossed
the Oregon border.
This is some remote shit, man.
This is way out
in the fucking boondocks.
Yeah, but it`s beautiful.
lt`s just the way we like it.
lt has great hunting, too.
Why hunt a pig, though?
This doesn`t look like something
you`d want to kill.
We`re not hunting Frank.
He`s our special guest.
Propane goes into the cabin.
Bring some beer from the fridge
while you`re in there.
All right.
OK, Frank,
let`s get out of here.
Good. Good, good.
Watch it.
He`s pretty nasty.
Wait till he gets here.
Come on, Frank!
Shit.
Goddamn.
Shit, l wonder what`s in there.
Beer.
Well, Mr. Burns.
-Hello, Doc.
-Nice to be here.
-Doc Hawkins.
-Good to see you.
This is my son Derrick.
This your first hunt?
l`ve been hunting
since l was twelve.
Not like this one, he hasn`t.
Meet Griffin, the oil man
l was telling you about.
Glad you could make it.
You sure about this one?
-l`m sure.
-Has he got courage?
Gentlemen,
l would like you to meet...
our new hunting guide Mason.
Mason,
this is Mr. Wolfe, Senior...
one of the most feared men
on Wall Street.
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-lt`s a pleasure to meet you.
-His son, Wolfe, Junior.
-How you doing, Junior?
Derrick.
And Dr. Hawkins.
How you doing, Mr. Hawkins?
You know where you`re going?
-Nice watch.
-Thank you.
This is Griffin.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Griffin.
Gentlemen,
l hope you all brought your...
appetites.
What are we having, a pachyderm?
Right this way.
Big pig.
Oh, man.
lt`s a good thing
you didn`t eat on the plane.
Outstanding.
-All right.
-My God.
Gentlemen...
l`d like to propose a toast...
to Doc Hawkins...
who provided us
with the initial inspiration...
for these hunts of ours.
Thank you, Mr. Burns.
Each man out here...
will experience
the animal within himself...
so embrace it.
Don`t deny it.
Allow yourself to feel
the purity...
of your primal essence.
lt`s God`s gift to man.
Here`s a toast to the hunters...
and a prayer for the hunted.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Well done.
-All right.
-Let`s eat.
Drink and be mery.
Would you pass me the carrots?
Carrots coming up.
Air mail.
You don`t really look
like a doctor to me.
l`m a psychiatrist.
-A shrink?
-Does that surprise you?
You don`t look like
the kind of person...
fucked-up rich people
give money to...
to tell all their personal shit.
l work for the company.
That`s the ClA.
l know these two gentlemen`s
personal shit completely.
Yeah, Doc thought, uh...
hunting would be good therapy
for us when we retired.
Let me get this straight.
You kill animals,
and that`s therapy?
-lt works.
-Hey, it works for me.
That`s the stupidest shit
l ever heard...
but it`s cool.
lt`s your thing.
Take your time.
Enjoy yourselves.
l am.
Life`s true pleasures
are so unpredictable.
l say, cherish the moment...
for what it is.
Observe your food...
smell it...
touch it...
put your mind into it...
and then when
you`re finally ready...
consume it...slowly.
You do it your way,
l`ll do it mine.
How in the hell...
did you become
such a ter-fucking-rific chef?
We don`t believe
in the average processed food.
We hand-pick carefully.
Cole`s the real expert.
There`s a poem.
Yeats wrote it.
Could you tell that this meat
would be this glorious...
while the boar
was still breathing?
l was pretty sure about it.
Well done.
How could you tell?
Well, it takes
some experience, but...
you learn what to look for.
You consider the, uh...
the animal`s age...
what condition it`s in...
its hair...
lts musculature...
how it was raised.
You can pretty much tell.
What do you think?
lt`s all right.
l like this.
Four-fifty a bottle.
$4.50? l should`ve been drinking
this shit a long time ago.
Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Don`t waste it.
l could live off that
for three months.
Well, you don`t want to drink
too much, anyway...
`cause you don`t want
to be slow tomorrow.
No, indeed.
You`re missing the best part,
Mr. Mason.
When you`re eating the flesh
from the pig...
look into his little beady eyes.
That way,
you will be devouring his soul.
Sometimes you even scare me.
Good.
Have a cigar, kid.
l want you to tell me...
where this came from.
Are you ready?
Hey, can l bum a cigarette
off you?
Take the whole pack.
l just want one.
l`m offering you
more than just one.
l only want one.
Well, then the rest
are going to go to waste.
Look here.
lf you got something
to say to me, just say it.
Where you from?
All over.
How old are you?
Thirty-two. lf you want to know
my pants size, ask him.
Come on, Mason. He`s only tying
to get to know you.
l don`t like people
getting in my personal shit.
He`s been looking at me all day.
Mr. Mason,
have you ever killed anything?
-What?
-My wife and kids.
-You sack of shit!
-John! John!
-You son of a bitch.
-Take it outside.
You`re fucking mine tomorrow,
you sack of shit!
What`s up with that dude?
He lost his daughter
a couple of months ago.
You didn`t kill your family,
did you?
How did that make you feel?
l came in my fucking pants.
l know more about you
than you think, Mason.
You probably do...
but l don`t know shit about you.
Ask me anything you want.
How`d you get that
fucked-up scar under your eye?
l refer to that as my birthmark.
On my eighth birthday, my father
brought me a bulldog--
a fat little bulldog.
l named him Prince Heny Stout.
He was strong.
He would chase my pet turkey.
He would chase squirrels
up the tree.
l trained him, raised him...
fed him, groomed him.
l loved that dog.
More than anything in the world,
l loved that dog.
My father gave me a handful
of chery bombs and M-80s...
and said, ""You`re gonna train
this dog to be a protector.""
So l got behind
a little dummy my dad built...
and l tossed these chery bombs
and M-80s at the dog.
After a while, he`d get angy
and come at the dummy.
He`d rip it apart.
Head was off.
Shirt was gone.
So, thirteen years old,
birthday time.
Got me a twelve-gauge shotgun.
We`re goin` huntin`.
l was so excited.
We went out in the clearing
in the woods.
My dad laid our guns down
and said...
""Son, today you`re going to
learn to control your emotions.""
""You`re going to do things
some men are unwilling to do.""
`"Follow me.""
We went around a clump of trees.
There`s a little corral.
There`s Prince Heny Stout...
chained
in the middle of the corral.
My dad took out a pocketful
of chery bombs...
put `em in my hand, and said,
""Get in the corral.
""Light those chery bombs
and throw `em at the Prince.""
`"You`re gonna face manhood.
You`re gonna fight that dog
to the death.""
""He`s gonna kill you,
or you`re gonna kill him.""
`"Now!""
He was on me.
He was on me like flies on shit.
l had no chance.
l got my arm up
between his teeth and my neck.
Went down in the mud,
rolled over.
That dog
is fightin` and bitin`...
and l`m screamin` and cyin`,
grabbin` him around the head.
l stand up and fall
with my weight on him...
hear his neck break.
He`s dead.
He`s not breathin`.
He`s not...yelpin`,
he`s not bitin`...
and l`m covered with blood.
l stand up.
l wipe the blood off.
l lick it.
My dad says,
`"Welcome to manhood.""
That`s why this is a birthmark.
Do your patients
know about this stoy?
No, but you do.
Turkey?
-Good work, Derrick.
-Here`s to the turkeys, Mason.
Well...
this is your room.
Mr. Burns,
l really want to thank you.
l know.
l`ll tell you
about the job tomorrow.
Good night.
Well, Hank...
l`m on my feet.
Once upon a time...
there were six little hunters.
Rise and shine, Mason.
Yo, what the fuck`s up, Cole?
Get up.
Put your shit on.
This ain`t funny!
Shut the fuck up
and put that shit on!
We`d like to play a game.
lt`s vey simple.
You see, the hunt begins now.
We`re the hunters...
and you`re the hunted.
You leave here now...
with a head start
of as long as it takes us...
to eat
a nice, leisurely breakfast.
lf you make it
to civilization, you live.
lf you don`t...
maybe God will have mercy.
Bitch!
-Here he is.
-Let the games begin.
You son of a bitch...
l want you so bad,
l can taste it.
Let me get the door.
Let me get the door for you.
Get out!
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Get out of here,
you stinking motherfucker.
Run.
Yo, Burns, what the fuck?
He`s going to chase his nuts.
Pace yourself!
l enjoy fucking with them.
Don`t you?
What excites me is breaking
his neck with my bare hands.
That`s fine, doctor,
but l assure you...
l intend to shoot that
son of a bitch myself first.
He better last long enough
to make it a challenge.
Trust me, he will.
Wait a second, Dad.
We won`t hunt him, will we?
Keep your voice down.
No, no, no.
He`s a human being.
He`s a homeless piece of shit.
He`s nothing.
He`s less than nothing.
Fuck that.
l won`t take any part in this.
You`re too much
like your mother.
l brought you out here to learn
something about yourself.
l spent fifty thousand dollars
for you to learn a lesson...
to develop an instinct
you don`t have...
and l`ll be damned
if you`re not going to learn it.
Don`t disappoint me, Derrick.
Now, come on.
Let`s have some breakfast.
You know, the only thing
l miss up here...
is the sports page.
l`m so used to getting up...
having my morning coffee...
and opening up the sports page.
l don`t read newspapers anymore.
They`re like the mirror
of the world`s ugliness.
l like beautiful things.
-l`m ready to go.
-Relax, Doc.
Digest your food.
We`re wasting time.
Give him more time.
Think of it as foreplay.
Never mind foreplay.
l`m talking about--
Prince Heny Stout.
Remember the rules.
l feel something special
about this.
lt`s going to be
so much more special...
when you finally nail him.
Eat some eggs.
You`ll feel better.
Eat. Eat.
l`m not hungy.
l beg your pardon?
l said l`m not hungy.
Oh. Terrific.
l`ll tell you what--
l`ll pull a switcheroonie here.
l hope this is not going to be
a problem.
lt won`t be.
You`ll be OK.
Dad, l can`t do this.
Yes, you can.
A thousand dollars
says my son`ll draw first blood.
One, two, three.
You made yourself
three thousand dollars, Derrick.
Damn, l wish
l`d never started smoking.
All right.
Let`s get the turkey.
You believe it? They always
start out the same way.
Shit.
God, what a beautiful day!
Don`t you see his tracks?
Stevie Wonder
could follow these tracks.
You`re mine, Mason!
l want you!
Oh, God.
l got something.
l see something.
Give me a bearing.
Right up here.
Two o`clock.
Three o`clock.
That`s a mule deer, Griffin.
Listen, you jackass.
lf l tell you l see something,
you can piss on a fire--
Mr. Griffin, why don`t you
stop talking about it...
and show us where it is?
Well, all right.
All right.
Over here.
l don`t see anything.
Come on!
What are you doing?
Griffin, there`s no one there.
Think.
l saw him.
l fucking saw him !
Well...
l saw Mason.
l just saw Mason.
He just shot and killed
four trees.
Let`s go take a look.
You laid them out.
They`re dead.
No one`s there.
Think.
Guns.
There`s got to be some guns.
There`s got to be guns.
You know what l`m thinking?
None of them
has ever done that before.
Done what?
l think he`s gone back
to the cabin.
He`s figured something out.
Let`s go.
Guns.
Them sick motherfuckers.
ClA bullshit.
My motherfucking ass.
l`ll show you motherfuckers
therapy.
Shit.
l`ll look over here.
Five thousand, he`s upstairs.
l`m coming for you, Mason.
Here l come, Mason.
Get ready, Mason.
What`s that smell?
-Oh, no. He set us up.
-Eveybody out!
Wolfe, get out!
God damn it!
Derrick, run!
We`re going bare hands.
l`m sending you back
to your wife and kid...
you piece of dog shit.
Get me the fuck out of here!
Help!
What a punt.
Dad, do you read me?
Get back here!
Dad, where are you?
Dad, l`m coming!
Dad, come on.
Dad, put your arms around me.
Come on!
Let`s go!
Having fun yet?
Come on, Mason.
Get up.
Let`s get him out!
Help me get him out!
Give me your hand.
Come on.
Where`s Mason?
Come here.
l like my meat rare.
Ty well-done, bitch.
Derrick,
hury up with that water.
l found this.
No sign of Hawkins.
-What happened to Hawkins?
-He`s histoy.
Oh, my God.
You`re not still
going to hunt him, are you?
The hell we`re not.
Hasn`t this shit
gone far enough?
This is where
it gets interesting.
He must have been
out here somewhere.
You didn`t see him, did you?
Answer the man, Derrick.
Look...
you just saved your dad`s life.
You should be proud of yourself.
Which way did he go?
You know, he killed Hawkins...
and he nearly killed me.
That way.
Let`s go!
Let it burn.
Oh, shit.
Ain`t this a bitch?
l`m not going to hurt you.
You ain`t going to hurt me.
You have a nice day, OK?
l`ll get the fuck
out your woods, OK?
Just cool out. Chill.
Nice wolf.
Cool, cool, cool.
Stay right there.
Oh, shit.
-There he is!
-Out of my way. l got him.
Oh, shit!
You took my shot, Senior.
Don`t ever take my shot again.
What is that, a threat?
He nearly killed me, not you.
Just don`t take my shot.
Or fucking what?
Be careful.
Watch yourself.
Let the fuck go of me.
Let me go, son!
l`m going to have to put
a bullet in his ass.
l see that now.
Shit.
lf he survived the river...
there`s only one place
he can get out.
Ha. Still dy.
All right, gentlemen...
we`ll go on foot from here.
Dismount.
He ain`t far now, Senior.
No, he isn`t.
Do you smell that?
That idiot`s
smoking a cigarette.
We`ve been had.
Let me see.
A tree smoking a cigarette.
l told you this guy was good.
You didn`t believe me, did you?
See, l know how to pick them.
Sack of shit.
Griffin, talk to me.
Can you hear me?
Come in.
Griffin, do you copy?
Shut the fuck up.
Motherfucker.
Griffin, your position, please.
Griffin, come in.
Griffin, talk to me.
lf you`re lost...
l`ll guide you home.
Burns, Burns, you hear me?
l wouldn`t mind talking
to Griffin.
He can`t come to the phone.
Know what l`m saying?
Mason, you`re a sack of shit.
Let me talk to Griffin.
Fuck what you want, Burns.
About what l want right now.
l want you, Burns.
What did l do?
l got Griffin tied up...
and you ain`t never going
to find him.
l want you and only you.
Fly me back to the city.
After that,
l`ll tell you where he is.
Otherwise, l`ll kill him.
Let me sleep on it.
You know, Mason...
you know why
we`re going to find you?
`Cause l can smell
your stinking ass from here.
Yo, fuck you, Cole,
you punk sellout motherfucker.
You`re going to do it my way...
or your man`s going to be dead.
Wake up.
Your friends
don`t give two shits about you.
Shut the fuck up, or l`ll bust
you in your motherfucking head.
Listen.
Burns ain`t going to come
looking for you.
By now you should know...
he don`t give a fuck
about shit but himself.
Just shut up,
and l`ll take this thing off.
`Cause l`ll kill you.
l don`t want to...
but l`ll kill your ass.
Shut up.
l ain`t going to scream
no more...
but if you are going
to kill me...
stop being
such a chickenshit bitch...
and pull the fucking trigger.
Maybe l`m just having some fun.
Of course you are.
That`s your kind.
You the motherfuckers
been tying to kill people.
Then why don`t you do
what we do...
and pull that fucking trigger?
Go ahead.
Pull it.
Look at Sirius--the dog star.
Yeah. You think
we`ll find Mason tomorrow?
l know where he is.
Yeah, sure you do.
Where is he?
Over there.
Take a look.
The little hole in the mountain.
We`ll have him
sit up all night waiting...
then we`ll surprise him at dawn.
How`s that grub?
Pretty good?
Pretty tasty?
Good.
Enjoy it, asshole.
lt`s going to be your last.
You ain`t in no position
to be threatening me, cowboy.
l ain`t even
threatening you, son...
`cause as soon as you find
the balls to take care of me...
you ain`t never going to make it
out of here alive, anyway.
God.
What`s up?
Big, tough cowboy,
you scared of a few little bugs?
Ain`t never slept on the ground?
l sleep in a bed, shithead,
not like an animal.
Sleeping on the ground
don`t mean you`re an animal.
lt means you`re poor.
Maybe.
That may be...
but you, Mason...
are a waste.
Know what?
l`m tired of you.
What if l took this gun...
and blow
your motherfucking brains out?
You`d bleed just like me.
Then you`d understand.
l don`t care about my life
anymore.
Don`t you understand?
l don`t give a shit!
l don`t care!
That`s crazy.
Someone like you...
just like you...
followed my daughter
to school one day.
The police report said that...
she tried to get away from him.
Nobody had ever caught him...
and for all l know...
it was you.
Ain`t that a bitch?
You got a personal problem...
and it ain`t got jack shit
to do with me.
You said you fucking killed--
You don`t know shit about me.
l was a mechanic, all right?
l used to work like a fucking
dog, night and day.
l had a wife,
and l had a newborn kid.
We lived
in a fucked-up part of town.
That`s where poor people live.
l was, like, the manager
of this building.
That`s the only way
l could stay there for free.
Had to work around the place,
you know what l`m saying?
The place was--should`ve
been fucking condemned.
l used to go to the city
all the time...
and told them
they had to get shit together.
The place wasn`t safe.
They didn`t give a fuck.
They don`t give a fuck about
people who live in the ghetto.
l told my girl l was going
to get around to it, you know?
The place was a firetrap.
So one day l come home late...
and l see this commotion
out in the street...
and l`m looking...
and l notice
this ain`t where l live...
but at the same time,
it was my building...
but l`m saying
it`s not my building...
but it was.
l ran inside.
By the time l got in there,
my wife and kids was dead.
l could`ve...
l kept putting off
fixing that place, man.
l just kept putting it off.
You said that you killed them.
They`re dead, ain`t they?
Hold your fire!
For Christ`s sake,
hold your fire.
Where is he?
Who do l look like to you,
Hary fucking Houdini?
l don`t know where he is.
Y`all leave me any water?
Yeah, on my ATV.
-Here?
-Yeah. Last one.
What time did Mason leave you?
Burns, l truly have no idea.
You don`t know much, do you?
Maybe not.
You hungy?
Can l take two?
l`ll tell you what l do know.
l`m out of here.
l`m going back where l belong.
l`m going home.
-No, you`re not.
-Oh, yeah, l am.
Lookit, Doc Hawkins is dead.
He ain`t never coming back...
and Mason could`ve killed me
last night, but he didn`t.
Gotta let him go.
Mr. Griffin,
you know we can`t do that.
What are you afraid of?
You think
he`ll go to the authorities?
You`ll never hear
from him again.
He`s probably right.
We`re not taking any chances.
Are you crazy?
-Think about this.
-l have.
No, you haven`t.
Well, look at all of you.
Listen once.
l`m going to say it once.
l ain`t going out with you
no more.
l`m through.
lf l can`t stop you,
l can`t stop you...
but l`m going home.
You stupid Texas cowboy,
you stop it right there.
Or what?
What, you`re going to shoot me
in the back?
l lied.
Dad! Dad! Do something!
You son of a--
Mr. Wolfe, we`re all
in this together, remember?
That`s the agreement.
Just like a family--
nobody ever gets away.
lsn`t that right?
That`s right.
We`re all in this together.
-Stop whining.
-That`s enough.
-Little punk.
-You all right?
Take a deep breath.
Now, listen.
Now it`s more than just Mason.
Hawkins and Griffin--
they were real people
who counted in the real world.
l`m as real as they were,
asshole.
You`re nothing, Mason.
lt`s such a beautiful day
out here, Mason.
Perfect day for hunting.
Where do you think he is?
lt`s down to you three of you
and the boy.
l got my own gun.
My odds are getting better.
Your odds don`t mean anything
out here, Mason.
What matters
is if you win or lo--
That wasn`t even close!
You never shot
a big bore before?
Yo, Cole, your mama`s up here.
l`m tired of this faggot.
Let`s get his ass.
Damn.
He thinks we won`t follow him
in the water.
Well, which way?
Let`s get wet.
We could fish in this.
Shit.
Something`s not--
Something`s not right
about this.
l don`t like this.
There he is!
Get him !
Get him !
Keep it going.
Gotcha now.
You ain`t--
you ain`t the last pick.
Oh, damn.
He ain`t the last pick.
What happened?
Relax. You`re OK.
-Next year.
-Shut up.
Next year, we got to bring--
We got to bring more pigs.
We got to bring the girls up
next time.
Somebody...
Walter.
We`re going to have
to put you to bed.
Derrick, l`m sory.
lt wasn`t supposed to be
like this.
What was it supposed to be like?
Like back at the cabin.
When you saved me,
l was so proud of you.
l`ll help you find Mason,
maybe even kill him dead...
but know one thing.
lf we get through this shit...
l will never forget this,
because l am not like you.
Shit.
Damn.
What the hell`s he shooting at?
l don`t care.
Come on.
Three left.
lt`s gotta work.
Come on.
That son of a bitch.
What do we do now?
Go after him.
What do you think?
Afraid of heights?
Good.
Bastard.
-You stay here, Derrick.
-Fuck you, Dad.
Way to go, Derrick.
You`re doing good, son.
Behind you!
He`s behind us!
Derrick, look out!
Dad! Help me!
l can`t hold on!
l`m coming.
Help, Dad!
l`m coming.
Hang on.
Don`t let me fall!
Dad, help!
l`m slipping!
Don`t let go, Derrick.
Help, l`m slipping!
Mr. Wolfe, Senior.
Let`s get the son of a bitch
who did this.
That goddamn son of a bitch.
He`s mine.
lt didn`t go in.
Give him to me!
Shit!
Shit.
We can`t get him from here.
We`ll have to go down.
l hope he`s not dead.
You son of a bitch!
Show yourself,
you son of a bitch!
Mr. Wolfe, don`t lose your head.
That`s exactly what he wants.
l didn`t hear you.
What did you say?
Go ahead.
You going to kill me?
Nice move.
Let me tell you
what we`re going to do.
lt`s going to be dark soon.
We`ll wait and sit.
He wants us.
He wants us bad.
We`ll let him come to us.
Sound...
is the key.
Be still.
Be patient.
Be a fucking hunter.
After l kill Mason...
we`ll settle up.
That`ll be...nice.
l`ll be over here.
Remember...
careful what you shoot at.
What--
l know you`re out there, Mason.
Don`t be afraid, Mason.
Come up here like a man!
Look, Mason, l got no gun.
God damn it!
l don`t need this fuckin` gun!
Come on, Mason!
Show your fuckin` self!
You can`t hurt me
because you`re nothing.
You`re a maggot.
You`re a worm !
You`re nothing!
Die! Die!
Fuck that!
-Burn, baby.
-Shit.
Forgive me, Father.
You`ve reached the offices
of Hell`s Canyon Outfitters.
Please leave your message
after the beep.
Hello.
This is Melinda Wolfe
calling again.
l left a message yesterday,
but nobody returned my call.
l still haven`t heard
from my husband and son...
and l am starting to wory.
Please get back to me as soon
as possible. Thank you.
Excuse me, Father.
God bless you, child.
Could you spare a little change?
l`m homeless.
Get lost.
Stupid asshole.
Hey, Father Burns.
Ah, shit!
How does that feel, huh?
No mercy, eh, Mason?
Holy May...
mother of God...
pray for us sinners!
Shit!
How the fuck
does this feel, Burns?
All your punk-ass friends
are dead now!
How the fuck does this feel now?
This...is the moment
we`ve been waiting for.
Do it.
Finish the game.
Please.
Bang!
Game`s over.
Lucky me.
There`s something you should
always do when you find a gun.
Say good-bye.
Always check the barrel.
