We got the monster that

[ Voice breaking ] My

<i>Girl: "So in the hours</i>

<i>"the people of Briarville</i>
<i>buried Trantor the Troll</i>
"in the cold, damp ground.
The end."
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Class, what did you think
of her report?
That's bull!
<i>lt's not bull!</i>
l read it in a book.
Yeah, it was a cool report.
lt probably just went over
your head.
The reports were supposed to
be on the history of the town,
not "Nightmare
on Troll Street."
[ Laughter ]
Now, settle down, class.
Lay off her, Murdock.
What are you gonna do
about it, runt?
Elizabeth scared Kenny
with a spooky story.
The dork likes her.
<i>Although Elizabeth's report was</i>
<i>a bit unusual,</i>
legends and myths are
a real part of history,
especially here in Briarville,
with our unique past.
<i>l think it was a clever idea.</i>
<i>Woman: Ernest!</i>
<i>Ernest!</i>
<i>Stop the truck!</i>
[ Engine revving, dog barking ]
So, uh, Elizabeth,
what was the curse
the troll put on Phineas?
Well, legend has it
that from that moment on,
Phineas' descendants would
get dumber and dumber...
<i>and dumber.</i>
[ Motor running ]
[ Water splashing ]
Yeah, when they hired me
as sanitary engineer,
they had no idea that l was
actually Ernest P. Worrell,
man of destiny,
ruler of refuse,
a man who has taken dominion
over his environment...

Sheriff...
l've just come
from the Hackmore place.
lt's an absolute mess.
lt violates every code
in the book.
l want it cleaned up, and l
want it cleaned up immediately.
Yes. Well, mayor, l served the papers,
and Ernest said he would get right on it.
lf he can't handle it,
you fire him.
Yes, sir.
There goes that idiot
now.
Ha. And he's going <i>away</i>
from the Hackmore place.
That was close.
Yeah, my dad said we can get
in big trouble riding in here.
Well, it is against
city regulations and all,
but as driver
of a garbage truck,
l feel like captain
of my own ship,
master of my own fate,
able to make my own rules,
a man above the law.
[ Siren wailing ]
Uh-oh.
lt's my dad!
[ Siren stops ]
[ Truck brakes hiss ]
[ Engine turns off ]
[ Truck door closes ]
Uh, was l speeding?
Sometimes the raw power of this
vehicle just gets away from me...
Ernest, l told you to get
out to the Hackmore place...
Kenny: Shh!
You two...
get out of there and
get in the car right now.
Dad, l...
No, l don't want to hear it.
Get in the car.
<i>lt wasn't their fault.</i>
<i>l-l'm the captain, and</i>...
No, look, l told you to get
out to the Hackmore place
and clean it up,
and you haven't done it.
Well, uh, l don't have
a toxic-waste permit.
Uh, l just took a cold pill, and l'm
not supposed to operate heavy machinery.
<i>Look, if you want to</i>
<i>hang on to your job,</i>
you'll get out there

Come on, boy.
We've nothing to fear
but fear itself,
plus the known fact
that Old Lady Hackmore
will turn us into
a couple of drooling,
red-eyed zombies
if she catches us here.
[ Rimshot barks ]
[ Crow caws ]
[ Organ plays ]
[ Rattling ]
Well, nobody home.
l guess they're out

Get off of my property!
<i>What are you</i>

Ma'am, l'm just here to
pick up all this garbage.
Got no garbage here,
only the expressions
of the soul.
Uh, ma'am, l'm
an official representative
of the Briarville
city government,
<i>and, incidentally,</i><i>a close
personal friend</i><i>of Mayor Murdock's.</i>
Aren't you
that Worrell kid?
...[ Bird caws ]... Yes,
ma'am.... <i>[ Gasps ]</i>
Oh... you will bring down
the curse on us all!
Woe to you,
oh, ye seed of Worrell.
Get out of here
and don't come back!
l wish you'd reconsider.
Recycling is a... a very
important part of good citizenship.
<i>Yeah.</i>
And you'll be
a dead citizen.
When the poisons of
the evil courses through
the portals and channels
of your body,
you will lie a quivering,
toxic mass of screaming flesh!
They will have to load you
and the rest
of this backward town
on a meat wagon
with a pitchfork!
So in other words,
it might be better
if l came back another day.
Aahhhhh!
[ Flames roaring ]
Ahhhhhhhh!
Pretty scary scream,
huh?
My heart
was in my throat.
You have a rare gift.
You haven't seen
the grand finale yet.
Come here.
[ Hinges squeak ]
See, they'll come in here
and go through that door
<i>and up this way, where</i><i>Joey
hits 'em in the face</i><i>with a mop.</i>
A <i>wet</i> mop.
Then they'll have to crawl
through all these peeled grapes
while l'm screaming,
"Where are my eyes?
Don't step on
my eyeballs!"
Gross!
But l love it.
[ Rumbling ]
lt's the Murdocks!
Look out, witch!
lt's an earthquake!
lt's a big one...
5.3 on the Richter scale!
Quick!
Let's run out the back!
lt's caving in!
lt's caving in!
Get out!
You're gonna die!
We're caving in!
Let's run for it!
Go! Go!
[ Wood cracking ]
You buttheads made
a big mistake!
[ Thud ]
Hey, where do you think
you're going?
The fun's just beginning!
<i>l don't know what to do.</i>
<i>They wrecked our haunted house.</i>
They... they wrecked
your haunted house?
Yeah.
You know, what you need
is some of that
hysterical perspective,
know what l mean?
Not... really.
[ Straining ] You need to
learn a self-defense lesson
from... tiny Botswana,
that...
plucky little nation
that defeated the...
[ Straining ]
giant Ottoman Empire.
[ Grunts ]
Ernest, what does that
have to do with me?
l'm glad you asked.
[ Grunts ]
[ British accent ] lt was a dark
night in lower Botswana.
Giant bula bula flies droned
in the still air.
Then it came...
the screeching war cry
of the Ottoman hordes.
Wa-aah!
We're the Ottomans,
and you're not!
You're in a world of it now,
pal!
Oh, my. l'm afraid.
Sure, l'm scared.
E-everybody in Botswana's
scared.
lt looks like curtains.
This place is just screaming
for drapes.
Don't worry about the Ottomans.
They're just wussies.
They're all talk.
l knew an Ottoman eagle scout.
He got a merit badge
in wholesale slaughter.
Aah!
Come on, Ottomans!
Take a piece of me!
[ Rimshot barking ]
What we need... is
the high ground.
The high ground is no good
without trees.
Friends, Romans, Botswanians,
lend me your tree.
There ain't no trees
in Botswana.
Unh-unh. l know.
l am a Botswanian lumberjack,
and l ain't never had a job.
We need dress shields.
You need the high ground
to keep away from us
'cause...
'Cause we're the Ottomans!
Aah!
Ernest, l know! l know!
What we need is...
a treehouse!
l thought we needed
dress shields.
[ Creaking ]
[ Whoosh ]
[ Glass shatters ]
Ernest!
Direct hit.
Way to go, Ernest.
Do you smell fish?
The first step
in treehouse construction,
which l'll refer to
as "step one, "
is tree selection.
With the right tree,
we can build
an impregnant fortress
armed with nuclear rays,
disintegrator beams,
and all the latest
electronic technology
to afford us a safe haven
against advancing hordes
as well as offering
truly elegant country living
in rustic surroundings.
[ Echoing ]
Nah.
Too much bass.
[ Solid sound ]
This one's nice.
[ Creaking, thud ]
Ah heh. Too many
termites. Ah heh.
This looks like
a good one.
[ Bird caws ]
[ Feathers rustling ]
lnhabited.
Oh, jeez. [ Coughs ]
What's the big idea?
A tree is a tree.
We've got to find one big
enough to keep the Ottomans out.
The Ottomans?
Don't ask.
<i>Oo-o-o-o-o-o-h!</i>
This is neat!
[ Bird cawing ]
Go on!
lt's okay.
Go on!
Go on!
[ Birds cawing and whistling ]
l don't like this.
Well, l didn't see
any poison ivy.
The worst thing
that could happen
would be Dutch elm blight,
and none of us are Dutch.
[ Birds snorting and cawing ]
[ Owl hooting,
woodpecker pecking ]
[ Bird cawing ]
Remember, if any of us
get separated,
there's an old pioneer way
of finding north...
the bark always grows
on the outside of a tree.
<i>Elizabeth:</i>
<i>ls he serious?</i>
<i>Kenny:</i>
<i>l'm afraid so.</i>
<i>This is it!</i>
The foundation
of the high ground...
tree of the stars!
This is a tree
to die for.
[ Bird caws, Rimshot barks ]
<i>Ernest: Come on, kids.</i>
<i>This'll be fun.</i>
<i>l've been collecting</i>
<i>this stuff for years.</i>
Well, l guess we got to
give it a try.
No guts, no glory.
Yes, just as the journey of 1,000
miles begins with a single step,
a treehouse begins
with a single nail.
Observe.
[ Slurp ]
[ Bird caws ]
[ Hammer pounding ]
<i>Man: Here he shall be buried,</i>
<i>and this oak tree will seal</i>
<i>his fate.</i>
<i>lts roots will be his prison,</i>
<i>which must never be disturbed.</i>
[ Rumbling ]
<i>Return this evil</i>
<i>from whence it came.</i>
[ Growling ]
Ahhhhh!
[ Growling, barking ]
One treehouse...
under construction.
<i>Joey: Crank 'er up.</i>
[ Saw cutting ]
<i>All right.</i>
<i>This is really working.</i>
[ Motor whirring ]
<i>This is great!</i>
[ Bird caws ]
<i>All right, Joey.</i>
<i>Over here.</i>
...<i>Another wall coming up.</i>
... <i>Good work.</i>
<i>Elizabeth:</i>
<i>One more side to go.</i>
This is really looking
great.
[ Bird caws ]
The spirits are loose again.
Who would dare enter here?
[ Crow caws ]
...All right! We did it!
...Yeah!
This is really neat.
This is your high ground.
<i>Old Lady Hackmore: [ Gasps ]</i>
<i>l felt it! l felt it!</i>
<i>Heaven help us!</i>
<i>The signs showed me</i>...
<i>the sun,</i>
<i>the moon, the stars</i>...
oh, horror will once more
walk among us.
The nightmare will begin
again.
[ Sobs ]
Well, it's not the greatest
treehouse in the world,
but l wouldn't call it
a nightmare, either.
...Worrell!
... [ Bird caws ]
What have you done?!
What have you done to the tree?
A whole world of trees,
and you had to pick this one!
Well, we didn't know this was your land,
or we would've asked if it was okay.
lt will open the ancient door
and all that lurks inside!
Flee this evil place!
...Flee!
... [ Bird caws ]
<i>Old Lady Hackmore!</i>
Wow! l thought she never
went out of her house.
Probably some simple
misunderstanding.
Maybe l should go
and have a talk with her.
[ Floorboards creaking ]
They will return...
<i>Well, wait a minute.</i>
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
We're not really <i>on</i> your place,
more like <i>above</i> it.
...Couldn't we talk air rights?
...Get away. Get away.
[ Bird caws ]
...That was spooky.
...Yeah.
Come on. l think
they went this way.
Yeah. They got to be
around here somewhere.
[ Bird caws ]
lt's the Murdocks!
All right.
Battle stations.
Let's see how this baby works
under actual field conditions!
Let's go!
Time to get even.
Tearing up this place
will be major fun.
Yeah. l wonder
where the wimps are.
[ Clattering ]
...Get down!
...Watch this!
[ Rattling ]
[ Clicking ]
l've got 'em in my sights...
lock and load...
and... fire.
Both: Aah!
[ Grunts ]
Load me up.
Ammunition coming in...
pepperoni and cheese.
<i>More ammo, Rimshot.</i>
<i>Good boy!</i>
...Let's go!
... [ Bell rings ]
[ Whoosh ]
Fire.
[ Thud, splat ]
...[ Clicking ]
...Fire three! Got him!
Bingo!
Chicken liver comin' up.
...Now!
... [ Bell rings ]
<i>Way to go, Joey!</i>
Ugh!
...[ Bell rings ]
... <i>That's delivery, boys!</i>
...Aah!
... [ Laughs ]
Aah!
Direct hit!
Ew! A pizza mess!
Binder, this isn't
the end of this!
Yeah.
They're on the run!
And no collateral damage,
either.
All right!
That was great!
[ Crickets chirp,
owl hoots ]
[ Footsteps approaching ]
Halt! Who goes there?
Uh, don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
l'm on your side.
Sorry, Ernest. l guess
we're still a little bit jumpy.
<i>Elizabeth:</i>
<i>Guess what happened.</i>
The Murdocks came by.
But they never had
a chance.
Yeah, and the Botswanians
kicked butt.
Told you.
Hey, Ernest, what was
Mrs. Hackmore going on about?
Oh, she still believes in
trolls and magic spells
and things like that.
Trolls? Like hide under bridges
and eat little girls?
Cut it out, dork.
lt's like the legend
of Trantor.
Elizabeth, get a life.
Just because you write
a report about it
doesn't mean it comes true.
She told me about this troll
that had red, glowing eyes
and walks like this.
[ Grumbling ]
[ Laughing ]
And if he ever gets loose,
he'll go after
the children first.
And he turns them into
little wooden dolls,
which gives him his power.
And that ugly little rascal
is still alive...
down there.
...But...
... [ All gasp ]
He can
only be awakened
on the night
before Halloween...
Like tonight.
...when a Worrell...
Like you.
...places his hand on a tree...
like this... and says,
[ Low-pitched voice ] "Yea,
l call thee forth, Trantor."
[ Knocks three times ]
[ Normal voice ] But what are
the chances of that happening?
[ Roots cracking ]
[ Growling ]
[ Growling ]
[ Thunder crashes ]
Looks like some rain!
Wouldn't be safe here!
Uh, hey, wait a minute, fellas.
Wait. Hold on.
Hey, guys, wait for me!
Hurry, Elizabeth!
Hurry!
Let's go!
<i>Hey, everybody,</i>
<i>where are you going?</i>
<i>Can't you see l'm up here</i>
<i>all...</i>
Alone?
[ Rattling ]
[ Rimshot barks ]
Easy, Rimshot.
Easy, boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
After all, we've got the... high ground.
[ Thunder rumbles ]
[ Squeaks ]
[ Rimshot barks ]
Yeah.
Good suggestion, Rimshot.
<i>Why didn't l think of that?</i>
Why don't we go on home?
How 'bout it?
<i>[ Roaring ]</i>
Aah!
Boy, l sure hope
you're from Keebler!
[ Growling ]
You better back off!
You don't want to fight me!
l know tai chi, kung fu,
Shao-lin.
l saw Hulkamania
three times, once in slow-mo!
[ Growls ]
Back off!
Oh, don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
l don't want to die!
<i>[ Growling ]</i>
[ Stammering ]

Yeah. Yeah,

Help!
lt was a monster!
lt was awful!
The tree and the lightning
and...
and it had great, big teeth
and things on its ears like this
and its head was at least
this big and about this long...
<i>Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>Ernest, slow down.</i><i>What happened?</i>
Ernest, do you know
what time it is?
Maybe Old Lady Hackmore was
right... maybe it <i>was</i> a troll!
Luckily, l was there to beat it
within an inch of its face...
Hold it.
Old Lady Hackmore?
Yeah, the kids and l built a treehouse
out there, and she got real steamed...
You took Kenny and the kids
out there,
trespassing
on that old lady's land?
Yeah, but what happened?
Sheriff, l saw a troll!
l really saw a troll!
Dad, something really strange was
happening in those woods tonight.
Yeah, you got to
believe me, sheriff!
Yeah, look, Ernest, whoa. Listen,
you just had a nightmare, okay?
...So pinch yourself...
...Ow!
...and go on home...
No, l'm not dreaming. This isn't
a nightmare. That really hurt.
...We'll talk about it tomorrow.
...This thing was huge!
lt had this great,
big head...
Good night, Ernest.
lt was probably just...
well, it was more about...
it was about this tall,
and it looked like a giant,
big Mr. Potato Head,
only as big
as a watermelon...
[ Growling ]
[ Thunder crashes ]
[ Thunder crashes ]
[ Bird hooting ]
[ Wood creaking ]
<i>[ Deep, raspy voice ]</i>
<i>Grow, my children, grow.</i>

<i>Ernest: Oh, Miss Hackmore!</i>
<i>Miss Hackmore!</i>
l'm sorry to bother you.
You have bothered
the whole planet.
You're cursed, now you're
rubbing it off on me.
But it's about
what you said.
l...
l let the troll out.
Uh...
That which has been promised
is delivered.
l-lt was huge!
lt had a great, big head and
little, tiny, beady eyes,
and great, big noses!
They were...
it was horrible!
You haven't seen horrible till you
see what it does to the children.
Heaven help us.
Them that dies will be
the lucky ones!
Oh!
[ Metal clangs ]
l felt it!
Heaven, help us.
[ Laughs ]
After all these years,
that <i>thing</i> is loose again.
<i>Oh! Vampires,</i>
<i>werewolves...</i>
<i>Well... [laughs]</i>
<i>l can handle that.</i>
<i>A few crucifixes,</i>
<i>a little garlic...</i>
perhaps a silver bullet.

<i>Ahhh.</i>
<i>Ghouls, zombies...</i>
<i>Ahhh.</i>

Hello, friends,
this is Tom Tulip
with Tulip Brothers'
One-Stop Salvage.
This is my big brother,
Bobby.
A fella comes in here the
other day, and he says to me,
"Will Tulip Brothers
give me a good deal
on an outboard motor
and some taxidermy supplies?"
And l said, "Does
a fat puppy hate fast cars?"
[ Rimshot ]
And then he says to me,
"Well, will you give me
a good deal
"on some surplus government
canned goods
and assorted socket
wrenches?"
And l said, "Does a one-legged
duck swim in a circle?"
[ Rimshot ]
But, no,
seriously, folks...
Tom, you got to help me!
There's a troll
on the loose, a troll!
Ernest, Ernest!
Cut, Bobby, cut!
<i>Can't you see</i><i>we are engaged
in</i><i>mass communication here?</i>
But l got serious
problems... trolls!
Oh, trolls! Bobby, our friend
Ernest is seeing trolls.
Trolls?
Trolls.
Oh, this is your lucky day,
but, of course, you knew
that when l was stationed
in Germany
with the 82nd airborne,
l was in charge of
the troll-destruction unit.
Have l got a deal for you.
Huh ah-huh huh huh.
[ Rimshot ]
[ Spokes clicking ]
Sorry l'm late.
lsn't Joey here yet?
No, Joey never got home
last night.
What do you mean?
You said Ernest came by our house
last night yelling about trolls.
Do you think maybe...
Come on, there's
no such thing as trolls.
But Ernest saw something
out at the tree,
and he's never lied
to us before.
Yeah, but trolls? Come on,
let's go check out the treehouse.
Maybe Joey's there already.
l don't know.
You're not scared,
are you?

<i>Troll Away spray,</i>

Does that include

Do rattlesnakes

[ Rimshot ]
<i>Kenny: Joey?</i>
<i>Elizabeth: Joey?</i>
This place
looks different.
Joey?
Joey?
[ Bird cawing ]
[ Growling ]
Something really weird's
going on here.
l told you.
lt's the legend.
Look at that!
That hole wasn't there
yesterday!
<i>lt looks just like...</i>
Joey.
What if it <i>is</i> Joey?
...<i>What if it really is?</i>
... [ Growling ]
[ Gasps ]
Something's there!
Run for it!
[ Bird caws ]
<i>You see before you</i>
<i>the state-of-the-art</i>
<i>troll fighter of tomorrow.</i>
<i>This multidirectional,</i>
<i>unitized,</i>
high-tech fighting machine
is salt-free, tuna-safe,
and comes complete
with 15 megabytes
of double-density,
wafer-thin alloy,
forming a virtual reality
of modern
troll extermination.
[ Metal clanks, beeping ]
Need l say more?
[ Metal clanking ]
[ Bird caws ]
[ Both panting ]
Ernest is here!
Come on!
We can't go in there! That's
Old Lady Hackmore's place!
lt's all right.
He'll know what to do.
Oh!
[ Growling ]
[ Bird caws ]
[ Whooshing ]
[ Growls ]
Aaah!
[ Growling ]
Anybody home?
[ Floorboard creaks ]
Anybody here?
...Hi, guys!
...Ernest!
...<i>We went to the treehouse!</i>
... <i>And there were five holes!</i>
And in one of the holes, there
was a little wooden dolly.
And it looked
just like Joey.
<i>Ernest!</i><i>With every passing
hour,</i><i>the danger grows greater!</i>
...[ <i>Children gasp</i> ]
...Who are they?!
A mother's care...
what does it mean?
Don't pay any attention to her.
She's a Gemini.
<i>And besides,</i>
<i>i-it's a full moon,</i>
ah heh, know what l mean?
Ohh.
The troll
is getting stronger.
He has one child
already.
By now, the tree is sprouting
its cursed pods.
Pods?
Pods!
And if they touch the ground,
all is lost!
He needs four more souls
before he can release
his army
and start to capture
the children
all over the world.
Just the kids?
Listen to the last two lines
of the troll's poem.
"There's one who can stop us
if he will dare,
with the heart of a child
and a mother's care."
[ Laughs ]
<i>So...</i>
we need a heart...
a child's heart!
[ Both gasp ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Metal creaking ]
[ Grunting ]
You wouldn't really sacrifice
someone, would you, Ernest?
Yeah,
that was pretty crazy.
Well, human sacrifice would
definitely be a last resort.
<i>Now, traps</i>
<i>is where it's at.</i>
You see, Mr. Big, Bad,
Short, and Ugly
will probably come strolling
through the woods
saying something like,
"Oh, l sure could use a rest,
"maybe catch a movie
on the cable.
Think l'll check in
to this troll motel."
[ Whimpers ]
And then we got him.
And with this alarm system,
the minute something steps
in our trap,
the beeper will go off.
And endo trollo,
<i>comprendo?</i>
[ Birds chirping ]
[ Lollipop unsticks ]
[ Thud ]
Aaaaaaah!
[ Echoing ] Ahhhhhh!
[ Bird calling, owl hoots ]
<i>Come on, l'll walk you</i>
<i>to your house.</i>
<i>Ernest: Hurry up, Kenny,</i>
<i>we got work to do.</i>
l still don't see why l
can't go with you guys.
Just leave
the troll fighting to us.
l'll find my dad.
He'll know what to do.
What about the party?
You stay here tonight.
[ Whimpering softly ]
<i>Another soul.</i>
[ Growling ]
[ Electricity surges ]
<i>Feed and grow strong,</i>
<i>my little ones.</i>
<i>[ Growls ]</i>
<i>Kenny: Thanks</i>
<i>for the ride home, Ernest.</i>
Okay, here's the plan...
Troll Fighter One...
that's me...
will be roaming
the streets of Briarville
like a rabid dog...
no offense...
whilst Troll Fighter Two...
that's you...
Um, Ernest, how about
l just get my dad
and meet you at the tree?
Yeah, your dad
might get mad
if we wrap this one up
all by ourselves.

You're such a wimp,

Kenny, what is going on?
Nothing. l'm okay.
Where's dad?
Where have <i>you</i> been?
l-l was with Ernest

Kenny, you have no business

Mom, l got to find dad.

Kenny... Kenny,

[ Spokes clicking ]
Bye-bye!
Happy Halloween!
Be careful! Bye-bye!
Take care!
<i>Honey, you hardly touched</i>
<i>your dinner tonight.</i>
Now, this is just
Halloween.
lt's supposed to be fun,
playing dress-up
and trick-or-treating.
But, mom, that little doll
looked just like Joey,
and Ernest said...
Honey, we have been
through all this.
There are no such things
as trolls.
<i>Uh, mom...</i>
<i>while you're in here,</i>
could you check
under the bed?
l thought l heard...
Stop acting
like you're 2 years old.
<i>There is nothing</i>

<i>Now, put on your costume</i>

We're all going over to
the Halloween party together.
But, mom...

catching trolls,

[ Creaking ]
You disguised

to the beast of Briarville.
[ Creaking ]
You know, Rimshot...
you're a cute, little dog,
but you are
one ugly little kid.
<i>[ Grunting ]</i>
Okay, Rimshot,

<i>The stick, boy.</i>
Bring me the stick!
<i>Please, Rimshot,</i>
l was just kidding about

<i>Rimshot!</i>
[ Whistles ] Ow!

...l don't know where he went.... Just

Listen! Listen!
They're probably already

Hey, kid, get out
of the street!
And you in the costume,
watch out!
[ Bottles clanking ]
<i>Ernest: Yeah, Rimshot,</i>
<i>we've got to stay focused</i>
<i>tonight.</i>
We've got to keep our senses

We are the thin line
of defense
that lies between victory
and certain death,
and l guess you know
the one <i>l'm</i> hoping for.
[ Beeping, barking ]
Troll alert!
Troll alert, Rimshot!
We got him!

We got old hockerhead
himself!
[ Beeping continues ]
[ Muffled shouting ]
[ Pounding ]
We did it, Rimshot.
We got him.
Listen to him howl.
Yeah, but it's too late
for Mr. Big, Bad Troll.
You picked the wrong guy
to tangle with...
Squid Lips.
Dad, there really is a troll!
l saw it with my own eyes!
lt was horrible!
lt used Elizabeth's voice!
lt turned Greg into a doll!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen, young
man, you are in big trouble.
You disobeyed your mother, and
now she's worried sick about you.
Cliff, it's my boys.
They're gone, vanished.
They were supposed to meet me
hours ago, and nobody's seen them.
Have no fear,
Ernest P. Worrell is here.
And, sheriff, l captured that troll
that's been stealing all the children.
Ernest, what do you mean
you caught that troll?
Yes, with the aid
of the most advanced
troll-fighting equipment
known to modern technology...
<i>Shut up, Worrell!</i>
Cliff, you got to get out
a search party for my boys.
Dad, Ernest and l
set troll traps!
Listen to him!
He's not lying!
Yeah, l've got him
right outside, sheriff.
All right, listen,
l don't know what's going on
here, but let's take a look.
Come on, let's see it,
Ernest.
Uh, Cliff...
<i>l want an all-points bulletin</i>

Kenny, that's enough

That does it, Worrell.
You're fired!

You park the truck,

Let's go, boys.
Ernest, you've been acting

[ Sighs ]
Follow me.
...Yeah! Come on!
...Yeah!
Come on!
[ Siren wailing ]
[ Owl hooting ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
One final soul
to set my children free.
[ Thunder rumbling ]
[ Evil laughter ]
[ Bird caws ]
Raaaaaarrr!
Okay, booger lips, it's time
for troll squish-kabob.
[ Gear clicks, engine revs ]
[ Tires squeal ]
Aaahhhh!
[ Metal crashes ]
You okay, Rimshot?
Good.
Another advantage of being
a wooden dog.
[ Bird calling ]
Where'd he go?
[ Bird calling ]
<i>Uh-oh.</i>
<i>There's your big-time</i>
<i>Brussels sprouts.</i>
[ Gasps ]
We can't let these
hit the ground, Rimshot.
<i>Got that?</i>
[ Roars ]
<i>Got it.</i>
<i>Uh-oh. Uh-oh.</i>
<i>[ Growling ]</i>
<i>Uh-oh.</i>
[ Squealing, sputtering ]
<i>Oh, no.</i>
[ Rumbling ]
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>This looks real bad.</i>
<i>Ooohhh.</i>
[ Growling ]
<i>Not another one.</i>
Heh heh heh heh.
Time to put a lid on this.
A little body pressure
should do the trick.
Wa-aahhhh!
Hit the end of the aisle
and split up!
<i>What are you kids doing?!</i>
lt's an emergency!
...Hey, you can't ride in here!
...This is important!
Get out of this store!
Go for the ammo!
Those costumes
don't fool me!
<i>Move it!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>The milk!</i>
<i>l'll get the milk!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>
Kenny Barton, when your father
hears about this, he's gonna...
Wait! Whoa!
<i>We're running</i>
<i>out of time!</i>
[ Owl hooting ]
[ Growling, snorting ]
Yeah! Ha ha ha!
<i>This is getting out of hand.</i>
[ Evil laughter ]
Devour the human.
And the crowd goes wild.
This one's over the fence
and out of the park.
This looks like three more
R.B.l. s.
...[ Thud ]
...Uh!
...[ Thud ]
...Diihh!
...[ Thud ]
...Uh!
[ Siren wailing ]
Attack! Attack!
<i>Spread out.</i>
<i>We'll find it.</i>
There's nothing to worry about,
folks.
l got it all under control.
Uh!
[ Trolls growling ]
Hold it right there.
Hold it.
You... hey, stop.
Wait a minute.
Let go of me.
[ All screaming ]
Give me that.
Let go of my shotgun.
Yaaahhh!
Don't you have any respect
for authority?
[ Trolls growling,
people screaming ]
<i>Come on, you!</i>
<i>There's another one!</i>
<i>Uh huh!</i>
[ Laughing nervously ]
Uh, your shoe's untied.
...[ Creaking ]... Think of
a number between 1 and 10.
Was it 2?
Ahhhhh!
Ah-ahhhhh!
Ahhhh!
Oh, no.
They're gonna blame this
all on me.
Oh ho ho ho ho ho.
Bobby, pictures of these things
in the <i>National Enquirer</i>
will make us rich
beyond our wildest dreams.
Get the camera out.
Go, go, go.
Oh, gorgeous.
Money, money, money,
money, money, money.
<i>Ernest: So you want</i>
<i>to play rough, huh?</i>
Ahhhhhh!
Ha ha ha.
Oh, l can just see
the headlines now.
"Briarville businessman has close
encounter with alien nation."
There's more.
Let's go.
Hoo hoo.
Help me! Help!
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!
There's a troll on my back!
Worrell selects a ball
and steps to the line.
lt looks like
a tricky 7-10 split.
A hush falls over the crowd.
There's a troll on me!
Help!
Here it comes.
The famous Worrell twist...
the release...
Yes! lt's good!
The crowd goes wild!
[ lndistinct yelling ]
l'd like to thank you,
each and every one,
for this beautiful
bowling trophy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank <i>you.</i>
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.
He never knew
when to quit.
[ Fingernails scratching ]
...[ Thud ]
...Oh.
[ Owl hooting ]
Kenny? Kenny!
<i>We can't stop now.</i>
Bring me the head
of Ernest P. Worrell.
[ Growling ]
Say, l'll bet you guys have
trouble meeting girls.
<i>Don't know what to say, what</i>
<i>to do, how to get things going.</i>
Heh heh heh.
Well, here's the answer
to your problems.
lt's the Pimco largemouth bass
CD and home-entertainment center.
A state-of-the-art sound system
mounted on genuine veneer.
But wait, there's more.
Ahhhhh!
l'm too young to die.
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.
Ohhhhhhh.
Don't kill me, please.
l hope l'm not too late.
Ohh!
Give me back that gun!
No! Put that down!
<i>That's loaded!</i>
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Oh, no, not the bullets.</i>
Too fast for you?
Too smart for you, too.
...Ow!
...Ow!
Gotcha.
Ah heh heh heh heh.
...[ Growling ]
...Here we go again.
<i>No, no, no.</i>
[ Bullets firing ]
Here, here, get the milk.
Come on.
Let's go.
[ lndistinct yelling,
bullets firing ]
Dad.
No.
You sure this milk thing
is gonna work?
We're gonna find out.
<i>Whoa. No.</i>
Kenny! Kenny, no!
No! Kenny, no!
Milk works, dad.
lt really works.
[ Roaring ]
[ Gurgling ]
Yes!
Get the key.
Get the key.
Here. l gotta go.
<i>Kenny!</i>
<i>Go get 'em, Kenny!</i>
Come on, guys.
Let's go get 'em.
[ Roars ]
Ahhhhh! Ahhh!
<i>Ernest: l've only got a couple</i>
<i>of things left.</i>
Ernest!
Hold on!
l'm coming up!
<i>Stop it.</i>
This is just the kind of Halloween
prank that gets people hurt.
<i>Ow!</i>
Hey, butt breath!
Huh?
How'd you do that?
lt's the milk.
lt eradicates them.
Yeah, it gets
rid of 'em, too.
<i>[ Growling ]</i>
<i>Sayonara, snot wad.</i>
E-e-e-e-e-w.
[ Growling ]
Evil demons...
make me strong.
[ lndistinct demonic voices ]
[ Growling ]
...[ Thud ]
...Ahh!
Your time has come.
Tonight the spell
will be broken.
At last our prayers
have been answered.
Soon, my little ones, soon.
Aaahhh!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!
[ Whimpers ]
Hey! Let me go!
What are they up to?
Don't worry, kid.
We got the high ground.
Did you hear something?
Boy, l sure did.
We came, we saw,
we took the high ground.
Even though some of us
are very tired.
Trolls, is it?
Oh, great,
l have to defend the fort
with a multiple personality.
<i>[ Growling ]</i>
Ew, look, they're using
those hook things.
Where's my machine gun?
Where's my little machine gun?
We were looking for a good scrap
when we found this one.
Now, chin up,
every man jack of you.
<i>A little nasal hygiene</i>
would go
a long way, young man.
Here you go.
l hope you're grateful.
Little trolls in China
don't even get milk.
...[ Air hissing ]
...Ahhhh!
Hair spray will fix
anything.
This is big money.
Posters, troll action
figures, trading cards.
Hey!
<i>You, come back here!</i>
Bobby, do something!
He's eating the film!
[ Burps ]
Bobby, do something!
No!
Oh.
Bobby...
This was our ticket
to the big time.
We're finished.
<i>Only a few more to go.</i>
Load it up.
You sure this will stop
them trolls?
They look awful
goddang fierce to me.
Anybody can whip a troll.
<i>Ace, the wall.</i>
Eat lactose, slimeball.
Hold on, dad!
Son, stay back!
Stay back, son!
<i>[ Growling ]</i>
You fellas like, uh, a
little bit of this milk punch?
That milk
must have gone bad.
l'm sorry, men,
but the dropper is the only way.
Oh, no, not the dropper.
The doomsday dropper.
Oh, no, not that.
ls there no mercy?
l like it.
A woman's work
is never done.
[ Clicking, whirring ]
<i>l guess l'll have to</i>
<i>finish this myself.</i>
Come, demons.
Work your worst.
Make me now invincible.
[ Growling ]
<i>A whole troll army wiped out,</i>
<i>and they leave the last two</i>
<i>for me.</i>
Victory is ours.
All right!
We'll never be hungry again.
<i>Talk about relief, oh.</i>
No muss, no fuss, the trolls
are dust, know what l mean?
Yeah. We did it.
We won.
[ lmitating John Wayne ] You know,
l knew when the chips were down,
l could count on you,
pilgrim.
Thanks, Ernest. You did
pretty good yourself.
You're a great bunch
of guys.
[ Cheers and applause ]
All right, Kenny!
<i>Way to go, Kenny!</i>
<i>All right!</i>
You don't understand.
lt's not over yet.
lt's not over yet.
You don't understand.
lt's not over yet.
[ Lightning crashes ]
<i>[ Roaring ]</i>
Uh-oh.
Kenny, behind you!
[ Roaring ]
We've got to do
something!
Kenny!
[ Thud ]
[ Thud ]
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
Kenny!
Kenny, get out of there!
Kenny, jump!
[ Elizabeth's voice ] Kenny,
l told you, it's the legend.
Ernest!
[ Growling ]
l've grown too strong
for that.
<i>Not even milk</i>
<i>can stop me now.</i>
Errrneeeeest!
[ Wind howling,
troll growling ]
Kenny!
Kenny!
<i>No!</i>
[ Crying ]
Kenny... Kenny...
<i>[ Growling ]</i>
Ah!
[ All screaming ]
[ Growls ]
You've had a nasty cold
ever since we met.
lt's going around, you know.
...<i>You know</i><i>what they
always say</i>...... [ Growls ]
starve a fever,
feed a cold.
Or is it feed a fever,
starve a cold?
l always get that confused,
like 30 days hath
September.
lt's my club and you're
a member, and, uh...
Worrell, now you die.
Come on, double ugly,
you do pretty well against
little kids and dogs.
Let's see how you deal
with a real man.
Come on.
Come on!
Kill him!
Come on!
Kill him!
Come on, snot wad.
l got something for you.
[ Evil laughter ]
Come on!
Come on!
Ernest doesn't understand.
lt's not the milk.
Unconditional love,
the heart of a child.
Unconditional love.
All: Yeah!
All: Kill him!
All: Kill him!
Heart of a child,
unconditional love.
Kill him!
[ Growling ]
Come on, little fella.
[ Waltz plays ]
Oh, you're so cute.
[ Smooches ]
E-e-e-e-e-w.
[ Wind howling,
indistinct demonic voices ]
[ Explosion ]
[ lndistinct cheering ]
Great. You did it.
You're a real hero.
Yeah, you really did it.
You're a legend.
Yeah,
he never had a chance.
With my brains and speed,
he never knew what hit him.
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it almost wasn't fair.</i>
<i>Here, he had</i>
<i>some good moves,</i>
<i>but when the chips</i>
<i>were down...</i>
Huh?
But, you know, when you're
fighting those trolls,
you gotta sock 'em one...
...Kenny!
... right in the kisser.
Like my ancestor Phineas
used to tell me,
"Ernie baby,
keep your weight down low."
Son, are you all right?
That was
really weird.
Mom, l told you
there was a troll.
Mike,
l'm glad to see you.
Kenny, l thought we'd
never see you again.
Mom.
Son, l did
a lot of things wrong.
l should've listened to you.
l'm so proud of you.
Thanks, dad.
Stay low,
stay sitting...
You know, Ernest,
in recognition of your
<i>magnificent</i> achievement,
consider that
Troll Away spray a gift.
Maybe we should open
a laundry.
Francis?
<i>Sister Francis?</i>
[ Gasps ]
ls that you?
My sister.
My sister.
Ohhh. l missed you so.
Michael, Michael,
l missed you.
How'd you get so old?
There is a lot to talk
about, but now,
everything is okay.
[ Chuckles ]
What's the matter,
Ernest?
[ Crying ] There's nothing
in that tree for me.
[ Barking ]
Rimshot.
<i>Rimshot!</i>
<i>Rimshot!</i>
Boy,
where have you been?
Did you miss your daddy?
You were gone and stuff.
And you were a wooden guy.
Now you're back, and you're
not even gone anymore.
You know
where we're going?
We're going for a ride
in the truck,
and we're gonna...
gonna go home and...
and we'll eat
nothing but the best...
