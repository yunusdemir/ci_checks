LEFT BEHIND II
TRIBULATION FORCE
It's been a week since the greatest disaster the
world has ever seen.
A week since people all around the world simply
vanished off the face of the Earth.
People everywhere are still struggling to come
to terms to the reality of what is happening.
Actual numbers may not be known for years,
but initial estimates are in the number of
hundreds of millions.
Even more unbelievable and terrifying is the fact that
every child from every country..
is among the missing.
For those of us who have been left behind, we
are living in a world of chaos and confusion.
Physical devastation is catastrophic and the
clean-up process has only just begun.
With everything from driveless cars to
crashing planes
inflicting their destruction across the planet,
the death toll is sure to be
astronomical.
But the post-disaster clean-up is not the only
issue facing overstrained governments around the..
- Look at this!
Young, energetic, honest.
With shock, grief and fear being the dominant
emotions, countless numbers are choosing suicide.
People trust him.
You're right, Mr. Secretary General,
they do.
Now many times must I tell you Nikolai
is right?
After all, we are on the same team here.
And I want him to join us.
The situation is even more serious.
My friends, I can only sit here  before you
now,  and tell you,
that for the first time in my carrier, I
honestly don't know what to say.
Or even where to begin.
I can only ask each and every one of
you to be strong.
This is Buck Williams reporting live from Chicago.
Good night and God bless.
Well, he sure manages to hold it together.
I don't know how he does it.
Told me the secret is not being calm,
it's looking calm.
At least he's not afraid to say
how he feels.
Hold your fire!
Man, you didn't have to kill them!
Back off!
Don't you know who this is?
Oh, yeah.
They were just kids. - Breaking into a van.
Give me a break. Hey, what difference does it make?
Look around. Let's get out of here.
Oh, come on, there is a huge spiritual
void out there.
It's only natural that all the people are gonna try to return
to all the ancient symbols of their religion to find answers.
You can't just shut down the Wailing Wall.
Well, it's being described as a safety precaution.
Yes, yes, the UN did shut down one of the
world's holiest sites,
but look what happened.
3 men were burned to death. Did they have
any other choice?
But what really happened.
How did they die?
People don't just burn to death in the
middle of the day.
And why weren't there any arrests?
And now the UN has said that it was under
misterious circumstances.
Now, don't we have the right to know more?
I'm sure that we will know more, but we have
to give them time. It just happens.
If it was anyone else running this show than
Nikolai Carpathia..
- Mr. Williams, are you alright?
-I'm doing good. How about you, Joe?
Oh, yeah, someone's waiting for you.
A Mr. Steve Plank.
Buck Williams.
Hey, Steve.
You know, for a reporter, you're a pretty tough
guy to track down.
What are you doing here?
Listen, Buck. Nikolai Carpathia wants to see you.
- Really..? Why?
I have no idea. But he asked me to find
you personally.
And contact him at the UN.
Alright. I'll get to this later this afternoon.
Hey, Buck. Don't let this thing sit on your desk.
I promised him you'll call him right back.
I gotta go. You call him!
Alright.
..now, a slighly different track. What's your reaction
to rabbi Ben Judah
who is perhaps the world's leading
religious scholar..
who claims he is going to announce the single
biggest news in history?
Hey, Mr. Williams.
Good to see you back.
You have now heard all the delegates.
Each representing one of 10 permanent members
of the Security Council.
Clearly, each of them agrees that this world is in need of
one thing above all else, and that is leadership.
You've also heard them to ask you directly to take this
mantle upon yourself.
But before you make your decision,
please allow our representative from the
World Monetary Fund,
to make one final appeal.
Sir, as you know, almost every currency
has crashed completely.
There is little doubt that the entire world market
could be just days form complete collapse.
unless we can consolidate at least the major currencies.
But no one is going to allow one single
world currency.
Perhaps no one would have, but now all
of that has changed.
You are the one man that the entire world
will accept to administer.
Mr. Secretary General, what we are looking
for at this time is
a leader who can unite a shattered world.
Please, I ask you, on behalf of every man and
woman on the planet,
to be that leader.
I am humbled by your trust.
If there is no other alternative, I accept.
Now, with control of all currency,
we are finally in a position to make
peace our only choice.
Immediately, we will call on every nation
to disarm.
To put aside all their racial, social, political and
the deadliest of all, their religious differences.
Today we must accept this truth.
There is no heaven or hell.
There is just us, here.
Now,
let us not look beyond ourselves.
Let us look to ourselves.
Together we need not fear temptation or evil,
for ours is the kingdom, the power and
the glory, forever and ever. Amen
Thank you all for coming.
Ray, people are missing. Dozens of
seats, empty.
Captain Steele, please return to the
flight deck, immediately.
Where are my kids? They were sitting
right here.
We are at 37.000 feet. Nobody just
walked off this airplane.
Captain Steele.
May you walk in the faith of the Lord.
What are you doing?
- What's it look like I'm doing?
You can't take them down. I live here too, you know.
Are you listening to me? That's my
mother and my brother.
Chloe, if you want them, then take them
to your room.
Fine.
Hello?
- Hi, Bruce.
Oh, good, good.
Yeah, we'll be there.
Good. Buck.
The UN just wrapped up another
press conference.
Nikolai's not wasting any time. The way they're
talking, he's not just Secretary General of the UN.
It's more like he's president of the entire planet.
What are we going to do?
- The only thing we can do.
Work together to share the truth to
anyone who will hear it.
That's a pretty tall order. Everyone in the world
thinks that Nikolai is osme sort of super-hero.
Convince them that he's a bad guy..well that's
gonna be.. - Well, how do we stop him?
We can't stop him. We can't change
the events of the Bible.
The Antichrist will rule. What we have to do
is fight him.
All of us. Together.
Form our own Tribulation Force and
spread God's word.
Why do I get the feeling that Nikolai
is not going to like that idea?
The Bible makes it clear.
The Antichrist will hunt down and kill
every Christian he can find.
Admitting you're a Christian during Tribulations
is just like marking yourself for death.
You got any ideas?
You seen those reports about the 2 men who were
burned to death at the Wailing Wall?
Yeah. The UN closed it down.
See these guys?
- Who are they?
The witnesses. The Bible talks about 2 men
who will appear
during the tribulation.
They will preach God's word, they will lead thousands
to salvation.
It's a crucial end times prophecy.
A lot of people think they will do their work
at the Wailing Wall, in Jerusalem.
I'm missing the connection.
God gives these men the power to defend themselves
with fire from heaven.
Wait a minute. You think that the
witnesses are here? Now?
That's what we need to find out. Something made the
UN close down that area.
You're right. I gotta get over there.
Are you crazy? You could get yourself killed.
Why can't someone else go?
Because I don't trust anybody else to stick to
our mission.
What can I do?
The US government just gave Nikolai a brand new airplane.
He needs pilots.
And? - And you've flown dignitaries
plenty of times.
You already have the security clearences.
No. No way..
- Ray..
Bruce, we're talking about the Antichrist here. He's
going to slaughter millions of innocent people.
I won't be a part of that.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
These are not ordinary times. But we
can't go back to the way we were.
You are asking me to drive Jack the Ripper from
door to door so he can kill people.
- I'm not gonna do that.
- None of this is easy!
But we have a calling now and we
have to stick together.
I'm not gonna fly that airplane, Bruce.
I'm sorry.
If you don't, then somebody else will.
Well, that's fine. Let 'em.
I don't care.
Who would you rather in the cockpit?
Someone who thinks Nikolai is a god?
Or someone who knows the truth?
We need the information to save souls, Ray.
Bruce, I'm sorry.
I can't believe you're gonna do this.
Chloe. I am not gonna let anything happen
to me. I promise.
How could I? I'd never get to see
you again.
Will you wait for me?
Is everything OK?
Yeah.
What's your plan to gest past Nikolai's
men in Jerusalem?
I plan to get access. My old
boss called me.
He told me that Nikolai wants to
meet with me.
- Let's not forget who we're dealing with here.
- How could I?
You think that Nikolai suspects that
you know the truth?
It's possible. This could be a trap.
Or some kind of test to see if I
really know who he is.
Don't worry. This will be completely
painless.
- Have you talked to anyone who was
there?- Yes.
And they all swear it as a
murder-suicide.
And if you hadn't accepted Christ,
you would too.
But, Bruce, the UN controls the Wall.
Nikolai controls the UN.
If I want a shot of getting close to
these witnesses,
then I need Nikolai on my side.
I gotta meet with him sooner or later.
If I don't, he'll get suspicious.
Besides, I'm a journalist.
What journalist in the world would not give
his arm for meeting with Carpathia?
We've got a seriously burned fireman here.
We need some help.
- The hospitals are all full. We need a bed.
- We've got a bed right here.
I'm gonna have to leave him with you.
You're OK, sir. You're gonna
be alright.
Give me a hand here, will you?
Get him there. On my count.
1,2,3...
- Hey.. How're you doing?
- Good.
Hey, Ivy, what are you doing here?
- You thought you could get rid of me?
- Yeah..
- No. No, this is great.
- Good.
Heard you came here, and I thought I'd be
important, so here I am..
What are we working on?
Right here. Look at this.
I'm trying to figure out what's going on
at the Wailing Wall.
Mr. Williams.
Who gave you clearence to waltz in here
and take over this space?
Hey, Verna? How you doing?
It's been a long time.
Drop the chit-chat and just answer
the question.
Verna, I'm trying to..
- You may address me as Miss V.!
Look, I don't know what's gotten into you,
but I'm working on a special assignment.
Special? Who assigned you a special?
And you are?
- I'm Buck's assistant. But you could call
me Miss Gold if you'd like. - Gold?
Well, I'm in charge here, so let me
lay out the ground rules.
You will not touch, use or fool with otherwise
employ this equipment
Unless you have my personal clearance
in advance.
Furthermore, you will not be involved in the creation,
development or broadcast of any specials
while you're working here. Are we crystal?
Listen, let me make something crystal
to you.
Specials are assigned by New-York, OK?
- And as long as I'm here. - Just drop it.
It doesn't matter.
Is that crystal?
- We'll see about that.
- We'll see about that?
Listen. It doesn't even matter. I know
the truth about what happened.
I know what happened with the vanishings and the
 UN lie about the radiation has nothing to do with it.
- What we saw was an act of God. It was
by.. - Crazy person, OK?
- You're temporarily insane and I cannot
hear you.. - Keep it quiet!
Look, we'll work from my place.
First I want you to call the UN and get me
in meeting with Nikolai Carpathia.
You know, this is just crazy. I can
go to a motel or something.
I've got a mattress in this bedroom, I've got
a couch in the other one. You can have your pick.
Very nice.
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.
Buck Williams hospitality. You gotta
love that.
Look at this view.
- When your fiancee comes, he can stay here too.
- Yeah.
Phone is blinking.
Very cool. It's just me.
No one has this number.
Hey, Buck. It's Steve Plank.
I'm glad you came to your sences.
Nikolai will be in Chicago in the next
day or so.
We're just forming up a schedule. We'll get
hold of you when we've got some time. OK?
OK. Ciao, Buck.
Did you give Steve Plank this number?
No.
I don't know how they found it.
Listen, if I'm not here, don't let anyone in.
OK? No one.
OK.
- Hey, Ray, he's starting.
- I know. I'm just waiting for Chris.
There he is.
- Buddy, how are you doing?
- I'm OK.
Chris. Buck. Good to see you again.
You too.
Let's go in.
Every person in this room has lost someone.
A mother, a brother,
wife, friend.
Ask yourselves this question: did all of
these people have something in common?
Yes. 2 things.
Either they had decided to follow Christ,
or they were too young to have made that decision
in their lives already.
So I've got good news for you tonight.
We lost our loved ones because of the rapture.
The Bible told us it was coming.
Anyone who believed in Jesus Christ is
in heaven with God right now.
What's left for us is a second chance.
I'm not gonna stand here and tell you that the
road ahead is gonna be an easy one, folks.
How many have heard of the tribulation?
The Bible predicts that there will be a treaty
between Israel and the rest of the world.
That treay will be brokered by
a great leader.
The signing of that treaty will mark the
beginning of the 7 years of darkness.
That's what we're talking about when we
refer to the Tribulation.
- So what's gonna happen? - What's gonna happen?
The world will experience judgments, terrible judgments.
Devastating wars, famines plagues.
And those judgments are represented in the
prophecies by these guys.
How many have heard of the 4 horsemen
of the Apocalypse?
And I looked and behold a white horse and he who sat
on it had a bow and a crown
was given to him and he went on
conquering and to conquer.
Revelations 6:2.
Now who is this first horseman?
I believe he represents the Antichrist.
And his purpose is made clear by the
2 words: to conquer.
- Is he gonna kill us all?
- No.
Other passages make it clear that he will
triumph not through force, but through diplomacy.
Through peace. Through a false peace that
promises world unity.
Does that sound familiar to anyone?
That's what Nikolai Carpathia is trying to do.
But Nikolai can't be the devil.
All he talks about is peace and harmony.
- Does he strike you as a liar?
- How does he strike you?
- As a savior!
- As a savior..
There is only one person who can
save you from your sins.
One Messiah. That's Jesus Christ.
I'm outta here.
These are dangerous times and we're
all afraid.
but this book also gives us a second chance.
Chris, come on man, wait!
- I can't sit there and listen to that garbage.
- What?
Save us from sin? Nikolai is the
Antichrist? Come on!
What is it with you people? You
think everyone's bad.
Well I have something to tell you.
There are lots of good people in the
world, including me.
- According to whose standards? Yours or God's?
- What?
You just said you were a good person.
- I mean, do you think you've kept the 10
Commandments? - Yeah, pretty much.
- I mean I'm not perfect, but I didn't
kill anybody. - OK.
Well, have you ever lied?
Yeah, well, who hasn't?
So what does that make you?
- Human!
- Come on Chris, be honest.
If you've murdered somebody, that
makes you a murderer.
- So if you've lied, what does that make you?
- OK. A liar.
Have you ever stolen anything? No.
- Even if it was something small?
- Well, yeah, once.
- So what does that make you?
- A thief.
You know, the one that really got me was
Jesus said..
Whoever looks at a woman to lust after her, has
already committed adultery with her in his heart.
- Have you ever done that?
Yeah. Guilty.
So, Chris, by your own admission, you're a lying
thied and adulterer by heart.
And that's only 3 of the 10 Commandments.
So if God judges you by those standards?
- Do you honestly think you're gonna be innocent
or guilty? - I guess I'd be guilty.
Chris, that's the point.
And what am I supposed to do?
Get religious?
That's what we're trying to tell you. Jesus took your
punishment when He died on the cross. That..
God did that so you wouldn't have to
go to hell.
That's how much He loves you.
Eternal life is a gift.
You don't have to do anything religious.
I can't accept that.
Ay, Chris.
We missed the rapture.
We missed the boat.
But that doesn't mean it's too late.
God calls all men everywhere to repent.
Come up here. Right now. Turn
from your sins.
Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Praise God.
You lost someone too?
Yes, I...
Hi Chris. What's going on?
What's going on, man?
Chris, it's me, Ray.
- Get out!
- Listen, you don't need that.
I know what it's like. I lost my
wife and my son.
Everything. Just like you.
It hurts, man. I know that. It hurts more
than anything I've ever felt.
I miss them terribly.
And I can cry, or hide or wreck anything in
my house,
but that's not gonna change anything.
They're not coming back.
I keep going because I know that
they are in heaven.
- That there is a heaven. That it's real.
- Real?
This room is real. This is real.
- Chris, why don't you give me that gun.
- Don't!
Not unless you wanna die too.
I don't wanna die.
I thought I did. I thought I
deserved to.
- It's not what God wants.
- God? God is dead.
You heard Nikolai. There is no heaven
and no hell. Only us.
He wants you to think that there is no
reason to go on
and he wants you to kill yourself.
Right here. Right now. That's what he wants.
- Why?
- Because you have a purpose.
Because God created you and me.
Everybody.
I mean, look around you. Do you
think that this is an accident?
That the oceans and the sunset just
happened by chance?
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that there is a God. There has to be.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
So if there's a God and there's a heaven,
why are we here?
- Why aren't we in heaven?
- Because we weren't right with God.
- No.
- Chris..
You can pull that trigger,
I can't stop you.
But if you do, you are never
gonna see your wife again.
Is that what you want? She's in heaven with
my wife and my son.
She committed to God and she's in heaven.
If she's not..
Then where are they? You tell me.
Where are they?
You can guarantee me that there
is no heaven.
Can you guarantee that?
100 %?
What if you're wrong? You wanna be with
them, don't you? I know you do.
And they want you to be with them.
Now you have got to make a decision.
It's the biggest decision of your life.
Trust me.
Trsut your wife.
You need to trade that gun for God.
You need to put your faith and trust in
God and you need to do it right now.
What do you say? Are you ready
to make that trade?
I've just confirmed. There were 2 men preaching
when the people got burned at the Wall.
Bruce, I think this is real and this is
happening right now.
How do we share it?
By turning it into a GNN report.
I can tie it to all that talk about that
new one world religion.
I get in there with a camera.
I uplink to a satellite.
Live TV. The world sees the
truth on live TV.
- I love it. - Alright, guys, what
about UN security, though?
The Wall's closed. I've got a meeting
with Nikolai.
Chris just got saved.
It was amazing.
- Praise God.
- I finally got it.
I know what God's purpose is for me.
I'm going after that pilot job
for Nikolai.
Ray, last time we talked you told
me flat-out, No.
There's no half-way with the Antichrist.
You're either in 100 %..
When Nikolai signs that treaty with Israel,
the tribulation begins.
- We don't have much time.
- You two are both crazy.
You wanna work for the Antichrist and
you..you wanna have lunch with him?
What makes you think you're even gonna
get the job?
I got a connection.
Whatever.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Is that your family?
What are these? It means they
were church members.
Listen, I know that you're concerned
about your dad, and..
I do not want to talk about my family.
OK.
Chloe, I feel like there's something
you're not telling me.
I think you're a wonderful guy,
but I've got a real problem with this hanging
out with the devil thing.
I don't even know if you're gonna be
alive tomorrow.
Hattie.
Ray.
- It's great to see you.
- What is it, Ray?
Well, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.
For what? Leading me on?
I'm over it.
I'm on a tight schedule.
What can I do for you?
I need something. I wanna
talk to you.
Funny how things change in the
blink of an eye.
- Hattie, I wanna fly this plane.
- You and every other pilot.
A few days ago you were warning
me about taking this job.
Waving your Bible around like you've gotten
to the deep end. - Everything just happened.
I mean, my world was upside down.
I had lost my family.
- I didn't know where to turn.
- But not to me.
Besides Ray, I've heard all the lies.
All the rumours.
What is it? Oh, yes.
The Antichrist.
Isn't that what the Bible is saying?
So how can you waltz in here and
ask me for this job?
Come on, Hattie. I'm a pilot.
I deal in facts.
We've worked together a long time, right?
In all that time did you ever see me
spreading rumours and lies about people?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I've lost almost anything, but
I can still fly.
I'm a good pilot and you know it.
I wanna give something.
And I believe the best way to do it
is if I work for Nikolai.
- I believe you mean that.
- I do mean it. I do.
You have to see him. Once you know
him, it's amazing.
He's always talking about the greater good
and world peace.
You know, actually, I think
he's christian.
Hey, Chloe. Come on in.
Everything OK?
- I have to ask you something.
- Sure. Come on. Sit down.
What do you think about relationships
at a time like this?
- Relationships. What do you mean?
- Well, romantic ones.
Between a man and a woman.
Are you sure you don't wanna sit down?
I think I know this man.
- Someone's who's leaving very soon.
- I think the stakes are high. Everywhere.
Including in relationships. Maybe God wants
you to make a sacrifice, Chloe.
- Maybe God wants you to let Buck go.
- Even if he doesn't come back?
I think you have to talk to him.
You're right. Thanks.
We don't want anything. Go away.
- I'm looking for Buck Williams..
- What? What?
Does Buck Williams live here?
No. No, he doesn't.
Look..what do you want? You want an
autograph or something? Is that what you want?
Listen, chickie, let me give you
some advice, OK?
You're not the first one to follow him home.
So why don't you go skedaddle and go
play with some college boys. Bye!
Are you gonna get that?
It's him.
- Him who?
- Buck.
Buck? What is going on?
- Nothing.
- Well that nothing has a lot of
omething behind it, Chloe.
He's engaged. I bet you didn't even
know that, dad.
- He's living with someone.
- Oh, come on. Buck is not engaged.
- Yes, he is.
I don't know where you get your information,
but if Buck were engaged, he would've told us.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ray!
- Hey, Buck. How are you doing?
A little frustrated. Is Chloe there. I think
we've had some kind of misunderstanding.
- I'd say that's true.
- Why? Is she standing right there?
- Absolutely.
- Do you have any idea what the problem is?
No, not really.
Well, I'd like to get to the bottom of it.
I'd like to come over tonight.
I think that would be a good idea.
Great. You mind if I come over
right now?
- That's a great idea.
- I'm already on my way.
OK. Buck. I'll talk to you
tomorrow.
Now, I am going to go take a shower
and go to bed. Good night.
Come with us, mr. Williams.
Ah, mr. Williams, sorry to meet like this,
but I knew you would appreciate the view.
Come.
It's good to see you again.
The last time we were together it was under
rather unfortunate circumstances.
Yes. Yes, that was a terrible thing
that happened.
Since that day it seems like perhaps
you have been avoiding me.
No. Why would I do that?
- It's just that things have been very crazy. I mean everything.
- Yes, yes, of course.
There is a whole world out there looking
for answers, Buck.
And I am sure you will agree that the
most important
thing right now is seeing that they
get the right ones.
That's why the UN has decided to assume control
of the world's major media.
- What?
- Sounds like you don't approve.
Well, a free press is the cornerstone
of a free world.
Leadership without accountability does
not sound very compelling.
I want only the best for this world.
You've heard enough to know
that by now.
I have traveled from country to country
in the last week,
and I can tell you first hand that I have
seen nothing but pain and suffering.
It seems that people just weren't build to
deal with this kind of overwhelming stress.
People have only one natural reaction
to something like this.
Find someone to blame.
It's up to us, Buck.
If people can't find the answers they are
looking for,
they will only have to make them up.
Think of it.
A world looking for someone to hate.
Turning for answers to a media who makes
its living from feeding rumours
and promoting conflict.
We may hold the secret to world peace
and unity in our heads.
- Why me?
- Because people trust you.
You're exactly what they need in
a time like this.
A voice of reason.
In a world of fear and suspicion,
a voice like yours
is the most powerful weapon in the fight
for peace. - And if I refuse?
I don't think you can.
This is too important.
If I do this, I need complete freedom.
To cover any story I want.
- Of course.
And I want total UN security clearance.
If I'm going to report the truth,
I need access to it.
Buck Williams. I welcome the
accountability.
Do we have a deal?
Good choice, Buck.
Hey, Buck.
Congratulations. I hear we're gonna be
working together.
- Hey, why didn't you tell me Nikolai controls GNN?
- Not relevant.
Listen, I'm gonna be your man on
the ground in Israel.
Anything you need, you come to me.
You know, it's gonna be a lot better
for guys like us.
Journalistic integrity, freedom
of the press.
- Nikolai is the boss you always wanted to have.
- Sure.
- Yeah, listen, I'm gonna go cover the
peace treaty.
- No, no, no.
The ben Judah announcement, that's
the event.
Believe me, it will the biggest story of your carrier.
Why is this speech so important?
Come on buddy. You're the reporter.
You figure it out.
See you later.
What are you doing here?
- Chloe, I need to talk to you.
- No. Go away.
- I'm not leaving until you talk with me.
- Fine.
- Daddy?
- Yeah?
Buck's here and he won't leave.
What do you want me to do? I'm taking
a shower. I've got soap in my eyes.
- Get rid of him.
- Well, he's not here to see me.
Great.
You have 9 minutes.
- Can we go inside?
- No.
OK. We'll just stand out here and freeze.
Obviously, Chloe, there's some kind
of misunderstanding.
Pretty smart, huh?
Chloe, I don't understand. I thought
that we sort of..
headed off. I mean,
I really like you.
- Me and who else?
- What?
Nothing. You have 8 minutes.
Keep talking.
What do you mean, and who else?
Chloe, I honestly have no idea what you're
talking about.
You know what? Forget it. Why don't you go
back to your fiancee before she gets worried.
Wait, wait. Wow! My what?
- I met her today at your apartment.
- Who?
Brunette. Back-towel. Big shiny
diamond. Ring a bell?
Ivy? Mrs. Ivy Williams.
Cute.
I am not engaged to Ivy.
Or anyone else.
She's just crashing at my place. She's
my assistant. End of story.
So, she's not...?
- I feel like such an idiot.
- Don't.
You know, it's my fault. I really should've told,
but I just didn't think that..
I'm sorry.
How are my 8 minutes doing?
You can have all the time you want.
Everything OK?
Shower huh?
You knew he was coming?
Thanks, daddy.
Good night, sweetheart.
But I know they're gonna have a
plutoon straight up to Golden Gate.
Don't worry, I talked to Nikolai.
- He's given me full UN clearance.
- There's a twist.
The Antichrist approves a story that could
reveal what he is to the world.
Once you finds out you plan to
put the witnesses on GNN..
Well, I'm gonna convince him that everything
I'm doing is for the sake of world unity.
- I'll pray for you, Buck.
- And I'll be on the ground with you.
- If you need anything at all, I'll be there.
- Thanks.
There's still a lot of "what ifs"
Bruce, I've been praying. And I know this is
the way to go.
Guys, the Antichrist may have powers we
cannot even comprehend.
We walk by faith, not by sight.
I am troubled by the developments
at the Wailing Wall.
Divided religions mean
a divided world.
These men, these self-proclamed preachers,
are dangerous.
Why don't you just arrest them?
I don't want to put them in jail.
This is not a dictatorship.
I simply don't want to see anyone
else getting hurt.
Increase the guards at the Wall.
Are you waiting for something?
The Wailing Wall is an important symbol.
Thousands of people have flocked it.
Exactly. The world is in shoc,
mr. Plank.
Millions vanished, no rational
explanation.
People are grasping it's source.
It's our duty to give them faith.
How, Nikolai?
By creating spiritual unity, of course.
A one world religion.
Tolerance, harmony and peace.
How does this create harmony?
Yes, mr. President?
Cut Channel 10, then give me the Buck
Williams report.
Right away, sir.
I believe people are finally ready to
accept it.
A united global society. The world will
follow us to peace.
And this man will show them the way.
OK, one more here. OK....Oh...
Let's have a silly one.
I think there's another one.
- You feel like a cookie?
- Why? Do I look like one?
- That is so lame.
-  I know.
- I know. I know. Here we go.
- Let me see.
I like that one. Look at your face!
I think I'll keep all of them.
Just kidding.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Well, this is where I say goodbye.
Hey, you know I have no choice.
I know.
- Listen, we still have our pictures, right?
- Yeah.
I'll be thinking of you.
He will be OK.
- Watch him for me.
- You know I will.
Be careful, dad. I'm real proud of you.
I love you.
I love you too, angel.
- Are you OK?
- I'll get a cup of coffee.
Alright. Here we are.
Good.
Hey..it's me.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to see what I can find.
Be careful.
Excellent.
Good work on the speech. ben Judah
loves the changes.
Well I'm glad to hear that.
Ben Judah speech..World presentation revised
Come on..Come on..
Captain Steele, is there something
I can help you with?
I was looking for Hattie. I wanted to
give her our ETA.
Miss Durham speaks very highly of you.
- She tells me you once worked together..
- Yes, sir, that's correct.
That past relationship.. did it extend
beyond the workplace?
- Excuse me?
- There are hundreds of qualified pilots all over the world.
I'd like to think she hired you for
the right reasons.
No. In reference to your question about
our past relationship.
- No, it didn't extend beyond the workplace.
- Good.
- I like to know where everyone stands.
- Yes, sir.
Captain, why don't you give me that?
I'm sorry?
Our ETA. I'm about to go see
Hattie right now.
Of course. Forgive me, I forgot.
- Captain Steele, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Good. This plane, it meets your expectations?
- Yes sir, it's amazing.
- Thank you, Captain.
And captain..
glad to have you with us.
- Thank you, sir. Good to be here.
Jerusalem
OK. Come on in. How did it go?
Did you find anything?
Yeah, I think so.
The attachment is the Ben Judah speech.
OK, OK, here we go.
The Messiah will be pierced without
breaking a bone.
Medical records show that when Nikolai
was 6 years of age,
he was pierced through the chest by a farm machine,
without breaking a single bone.
The Messiah will travel to Egypt
as a young child.
This is what Ben Judah's big announcement
is all about.
He's gonna announce that Nikolai is the Messiah.
That's why Nikolai wants me here.
He's using me to promote the speech.
No, no, we're missing something here. If this
is Ben Judah's speech,
then why did I hear Nikolai thank Steve
Plank for writing it?
Or rewriting it.
Come on, Ray, look.
The Messiah will pe pierced without breaking a bone.
We all know that was Jesus Christ.
He was stabbed when He was hanging on the cross.
Ben Judah was going to announce that
Jesus Christ is the Messiah.
They changed the speech.
But how are they going to get
Ben Judah to read it?
Nikolai's got a lot of people under his power.
We've got to get to Ben Judah.
And then what? I mean, if he has all these
people under his power, or his spell, or
whatever you wanna call it, it's supernatural.
- What can you do?
- I can't do anything. But God can.
- The only thing that's gonna break it is the
power of God. - But how?
We get Ben Judah face to face with
the Word of God.
- Buck...
- We take him to the witnesses.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Buck, good to see you.
- Steve.
Listen, I need a favor.
- I need to get to the Wailing Wall.
- Why?
The 2 men at the Wall..
Listen, I know they're a problem for Nikolai.
I think I can discredit them, I think
I can make them go away.
Well, I like it. I like it a lot.
But I can't do it.
Not even for you.
It's off-limits.
- Oh, Steve, come on...
- No, no, no...
Nikoali has everyone's best interests
at heart.
He wants to unify the world,
not divide it.
The more attention you give to those guys,
the worse they're gonna make it.
This, this right here, is where the
world is going.
One faith for everyone.
Don't even think about it.
Can I read to you?
Let not your heart be troubled.
Ye who believe in God, believe also in Me.
In my Father's House are many mansions.
If it were not so, I would
have told you.
I will go and prepare a place for you,
And if I go and prepare a place for you,
I'll come again.
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.
Look. Buck told me where I
could find you,
but it kinda looks like
you have your hands full, so..
I'll make it short. I owe you an apology.
- I guess we both jumped to the wrong
conclusions. - Yeah...
- I'm Ch...
- Excuse me, sorry.
- I'm Chloe.
- I'm Ivy.
- So anyway, I'm sorry. - No problem,
You're quite the fierce protectoress.
I guess we all have our talents.
- So anyway,do you believe in this stuff?
- Yeah, yeah I do.
- Magic formula?
- It's not magic. It's faith.
And you get that from reading
your Bible?
It's not just reading. It's believing.
I guess it's like my Mum said. Faith is a choice
and it comes from the heart
so, you either wanna believe it
or you don't.
It's never been a strong point for me, so..
- But hey...Good luck.
 - Thanks.
Hey. Sorry about that.
And if I go and prepare a place for you..
I will come again and receive you
unto myself.
that where I am there you may
also be.
Excuse me. Rabbi Ben Judah?
- Yes?
- Hi. My name is..
Buck Williams. I think the whole
world knows who you are.
I was wondering if we could talk?
What can I do for you?
- It's about the 2 men at the Wall.
- They are dangerous men.
- Why? - They wish to divide
the world through religion. This is not right.
There is no heaven or hell.
There is only us.
We must not allow closed-mind fanaticism to
divide the world any further.
But there are many people who believe
that these men have something very important to say.
- And that Nikolai must be hiding something.
- That's ridiculous.
Why would Nikolai do such a thing?
But rabbi, in a world like this a tiny rumour
like that could spread like a wildfire.
And there's no telling how many people
might believe it.
That's why I want you to come to the Wall
to speak to them.
You are the world's most knowledgeable
and respected religious scholar.
If anyone can discredit these men,
it's you.
You can question them if you want
and if they stumble for answers,
if they contradict themselves, I'll have the whole
thing on tape, for the whole world wide GNN
audience to see.
Rabbi, think of it as a gift to Nikolai.
He has much more important things to worry
about right now than a couple of radicals.
Let's expose these men for who they really are,
before they become martyrs for their cause.
Nikolai is lucky to have a friend like you.
I know this guy. Ne never quits.
I mean this is the guy who broadcasted from
Israel with planes crashing all around him.
Exactly why he's with us.
People love him.
His coverage will help them understand
and accept the peace process.
He came to me today. He wants
access to the Wailing Wall.
- He wants to discredit the witnesses.
- If I thought he could...
I want 24 hours monitors on all GNN broadcasts
Immediate notification for any footage from
the Wailing Wall. Go!
An official press release:
due to extremist threats,
against the Wailing Wall, any and all
tresspassers will be shot on sight.
Alright. Well, that should keep even
Buck Williams away.
- Hey, how's it going?
- It's going great.
Good. You're ready?
Yes. The equipment's ready. The GNN
uplink is good to go.
But I still don't know how we're gonna
get to the Wailing Wall.
God got us this far, He'll take
us the rest of the way.
You just get Ben Judah there,
let me take care of the rest.
Besides, I've told Chloe that I'd
look out for you.
Really? I told her that I'd look out
for you. - Really?
Hey, listen, Ray.
You know I really have no idea
what you must be feeling,
having lost your wife and son.
But I know that Chloe is really worried about you.
It's just...it's just hard to let go.
You know?
I'm gonna be alright.
Let's pray.
God, some things are just so hard to
understand and to accept.
Please help us to accept Your will and give us
the faith and the strength
that we need to do what you want us to do.
and we thank You that You're
in control.
We're praying in Your Son's name.
Amen.
- Hello. - Hey, it's me.
- Hi, Buck. It's so good to hear your voice.
- Are you guys OK?
- Yeah, yeah..we're fine.
Look, it's starting to get dark over here and
I just wanted to say that I miss you.
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
- Good. I'm still going to the Wailing Wall.
- Buck, you can't.
The UN just announced that anyone who tries to
approach will be shot on sight.
Chloe, don't worry.
God will protect me.
Just pray.
I did. I asked Him to bring
you home. I really miss you.
Me too.
Take care.
Glad you could make it.
The sooner we go, the sooner we
put an end to the lies.
Let's go.
DO NOT CROSS.
VIOLATORS WILL BE SHOT.
Stay. Right here.
That's all. Stop. Show me your ID.
I'm with GNN. I work
with Nikolai Carpathia.
No. We have strict orders.
No one passes.
Give me strength, God.
May you walk in the faith of the Lord.
Stop!
You stop immediately!
Stay where you are!
Halt! Right now!
That's all!
Ready!
Aim!
The Lord has chosen this as a building
for his sanctuary.
- He said: Take head now, for the Lord..
- I know, I know. He's speaking in English.
You are false prophets.
Claiming to know the secrets to God's kingdom.
God will bring every deed into judgment,
Ben Judah.
Including every hidden thing,
whether it is good or evil.
I, the Lord, search the heart,
I test the mind.
And I will give to every man according to
his ways and according to what he has done.
I have kept the Commandments since my youth.
By the deeds of the law,
no flesh shall be justified in His sight.
For by grace you are saved, through
faith,
and this is not for yourselves,
it is the gift of God.
Not by works, so that no one
can boast.
Cut it.
- I don't understand.
- We are ambassadors.
As though God was making His
appeal through us.
This is GNN. We are experiencing
technical difficulties.
Please stand by.
Be reconciled to God.
God made Him who had no sin
to be sin for us,
so that in Him, we might become the
righteousness of God.
For God so loved the world, that He gave
His one and only son,
that whoever believes in Him will not
perish,
but have everlasting life.
For God did not send His son into the
world to condemn the world,
but to save the world through Him.
He who believes in the Son
is not condemned.
But he who does not believe is condemned
already, because he has not believed in
the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And the name of the Son of God?
He is the Christ, Jesus.
Buck, how did it go?
It was insane. But I got the
witnesses on TV and..
- What? - I spoke to Chloe. The
broadcast got cut. Nobody saw it.
What do you mean?
- But at least Ben Judah heard the truth..
- I don't know. He was gone...
- What do you mean you don't know?
- He was gone. Before I could talk to him.
It's in God's hands now.
It's good to see you back.
- I thought you could use some food.
- Thanks.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready for God.
- Then tell Him.
Dear God, I'm so sorry I've sinned
against you,
Please forgive me. I want to do
the right thing.
Jesus, thank You.
Thank You for dying for me.
I put my life in Your hands.
You were so great.
- It was good. Did you see his eyes?
- Yeah.
So much peace in his eyes.
- He found God.
- Yeah, he did.
I regret that I cannot be present
for this long awaited announcement.
Rabbi Ben Judah, whom I have
recently just met,
is recognised as the world's leading
authority
on rabbinical teachings and the
ancient scriptures.
He is known as an honest man.
A careful man.
A man who supports every conclusion with
well researched data.
He will be joining you in approximately
1 hour.
Unfortunately, pressing UN business calls
me back to New-York.
So I will leave you now.
I wish you peace.
- Hello.
- Buck.
- Ray, where are you?
- I'm on the plane. Nikolai is leaving.
- Yeah, I heard it.
Listen, I'm gonna do all that I can from
this end. You take care of yourself.
Thanks. God bless.
I appreciate what you tried to do
for me at the Wailing Wall.
Don't you worry, this is the real
reason why you're here.
I'm sure you will find this announcement
fascinating.
- I'll be back in a bit. You good?
- Yeah, sure.
 - Ready for the broadcast.
- Please.
Here we go.
And after years of study,
My team has concluded beyond the shadow of
a doubt the identity of the Messiah.
The Bible has given clear prophecies
that could be fullfilled by only one
person in the entire universe.
Bassd on 456 Messianic passages
and 558 references from the most
ancient rabbinical writings,
There are 109 distinct prophecies
that the Messiah must fullfill.
Perhaps you will be relieved to know that
I will not detail all 109 this evening.
the possibility of even 20 of this 109 prophecies
be fullfilled by one man is well to 1 in a
100 million.
Now in light of recent world events there
has been much speculation
that the Messiah does indeed walk among
us today.
So let us look at the prophecies.
Some of us could apply for any of us.
For example, the Messiah will be proceeded
by a forerunner.
He, and the prophecies do refer of
a man
who will be pierced without breaking
a bone.
Then it starts to narrow.
The Messiah must be born of an extremely
rare bloodline.
He will travel to Egypt as a
young child.
He will be rejected by his own people.
The Messiah must be born in Bethlehem.
The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend
for 30 pieces of silver.
And perhaps the most amazing, the Messiah
was predicted to have supernatural powers.
We don't have a connection.
Get the cell-phone. Now!
...be resurrected again.
There is only one person in history
who fullfills all these prophecies.
And His name is Jesus Christ.
Praise God!
What I did not believe, I have seen.
God's witnesses.
And I have heard the truth. I beg you,
each of you,
to open your eyes to see the truth
and turn to God's faith.
Please forgive me.
- He has sent us a Savior.
- I need You.
Jesus Christ.
Please forgive me for doubting.
Cut it. Cut it now!
This is GNN. We are experiecing technical
difficulties.
Pray with me.
I accept you Jesus into my life.
I accept you Jesus into my life.
-  And my heart.
- And my heart.
And I ask you Jesus to stay with me forever.
And I ask you Jesus to stay with me forever.
 - Amen.
- Amen.
- I don't know if you're gonna be safe here.
- I will be fine.
Thanks, Buck. Thanks to you,
millions have heard the truth.
Thanks to God.
- Would you like taking a break?
- Yeah..
Thank you, God. Thank you.
- Nikolai, can I get you anything?
- Leave.
Leave!!
This is not the end!
This is my time!
My will be done!
I will rule.
Oh, Lord my God,
When I'm in awesome wonder
Consider all the work Thy
hands have made
I see the stars,
I hear the roaring thunder.
My path throughout the universe
displayed.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God
to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God
to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God
to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God
to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
