THE BLUE RIDGE,
SOME FOLKS SAY,
IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
PLACE IN AMERICA.
I'D ALLOW THAT.
THE CHEROKEE
WAS HERE FIRST,
THEN THE LIKES OF US--
MOUNTAIN PEOPLE.
IT'S TOUGH LAND,
BUT THEY WAS FOLKS
TO MATCH--
MY GRANDDADDY...
MY DADDY.
MY DADDY
CLEARED THIS PLACE.
TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DRAG A LIVING
OUT OF ROUGH GROUND.
HEH. YES, SIR.
THE NATIONS' PLACE.
MY LAND.
THAT'S MY ANNIE
COME TO VISIT ME.
OUR BOY EZRA
LIVED BUT ONE DAY.
THAT'S OUR MARY.
AGE 5.

MY MA AND PA.
AND THIS HERE'S MINE.
YOU THERE, HECTOR?
I'M ALWAYS HERE.
I BRUNG YOU SOME FLOWERS.
YOU REST YOURSELF,
OLD WOMAN.
WHAT'S TROUBLING YOU?
YOU'RE WORRYING
ABOUT DILLARD AGAIN.
I WISH I COULD KEEP
MY THOUGHTS TO MYSELF.
YOU THINK IT,
I KNOW IT.
HAD A LETTER FROM HIM
YESTERDAY.
MADE ME UNEASY.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
IT WEREN'T
WHAT HE SAID.
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S DOING GOOD
WITH HIS SINGING, I GUESS.
I JUST WISH
HE WEREN'T SO FAR AWAY.
%% BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'LL DO %%
%% ALL I DO IS
SIT AND SIGH %%

SLEEP TIGHT, HECKIE.
DADDY, HOW LONG
WILL YOU BE GONE?
TWO NIGHTS.
TWO GIGS.
YOU LIKE STAYING
WITH THE MASONS.
I DON'T CARE.
I'M GOING
TO PLAY IN GEORGIA.
I'LL SEE YOUR GRANDMA.
I WANT TO SEE GRANDMA.
SHH.
YOUR TEACHER
WILL KILL ME.
YOU GO TO SLEEP.
TAKE HER OUR CUTOUTS.
CUTOUTS?
FOR A SURPRISE.
AND THUMBTACKS
SO SHE CAN PIN THEM UP.
SURE, HONEY.
YOU PROMISE?
I PROMISE.
WHEN GRANDMA WAKES UP,
SHE'LL SEE SUSIE AND ME
ON THE WALL.
YOU GO TO SLEEP.
GOOD MORNING.
YOU STILL FRETTING
ABOUT THAT BOY?
HE'S PLAYING A CONCERT
AT HIAWASSEE SATURDAY.
HIAWASSEE?
THAT'S 30 MILES
FROM HERE.
YOU AIN'T GOING.
HE SAID HE'D STOP BY.
TRAIPSE AROUND
THE COUNTRY WITH A GUITAR.
THAT'S NO KIND OF WORK.
NOW, HECTOR.
IT'S LAND
THAT TOOK CARE OF HIM.
DILLARD MAKES
A GOOD LIVING.
REMEMBER THIS?
YOU HAD TO KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A LIVING THEN.
FILLED HER UP WITH
CORN, SORGHUM, CABBAGE.
TAKE THE STUFF
TO MARKET,
BRING IT HOME AGAIN,
FEED IT TO THE HOGS.
HOOVER'S TIME.
HADN'T BEEN
FOR CORN LIQUOR
AND SMART TRADING,
WE'D HAVE HAD
AN EMPTY TABLE AROUND HERE.
IT'S SO HOT
IN THIS KITCHEN.
I'M GOING
TO WORK OUTSIDE.
FLIES WILL KILL YOU.
BETTER FLIES
THAN HEAT STROKE.
[HORN HONKS]
WHO'S THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
[HONK HONK]
COMPANY.
I'M GOING BACK
TO MY ORCHARD.
LET ME HELP YOU, MA'AM.
THAT'S TOO HEAVY
FOR A LITTLE LADY.
I CAN STILL DO IT.
THANK YOU.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR BUSTING IN
LIKE THIS, MRS. NATIONS,
BUT AS I REMEMBER,
YOU DON'T HAVE A PHONE.

I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY.
WE NEVER DID
STEP IT OFF.
MAYBE 100.
HECTOR
COULD TELL YOU.
MR. NATIONS?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU COME
TO SEE MY HUSBAND?
NO, MA'AM.
I COME TO SEE YOU.
I GOT
A PROPOSITION TO MAKE.
OH.
WHAT'S THAT,
MR. CARPENTER?
THAT'S A PIG.
AIN'T HE A BEAUTY?
NOW,
IF I COULD
JUST GET MY KNIFE
DOWN IN THERE,
MAYBE I CAN
DIG OUT THAT EYE.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH THAT THING?
MAKE SOUSE MEAT.
BOY, THAT'S THE BEST
STUFF I EVER ATE.
I'M SILLY
ABOUT SOUSE MEAT.
JUST CAN'T
GET THROUGH THERE.
MY HAND
AIN'T AS STOUT
AS IT USED TO BE.
I'D BE OBLIGED
IF YOU'D GIVE HIM
ONE GOOD CUT
SO'S I CAN
GET MY FINGERS IN.
UH, HERE?
THAT'S FINE.
JUST OPEN HIM UP.
TRY NOT
TO HIT THE EYEBALL.
THAT BLACK STUFF
WILL SQUIRT
ALL OVER YOU.
THAT'S IT.
OH. YOU WANT
I SHOULD DO
THE OTHER SIDE.
IF YOU PLEASE.
I WISH
I HAD MY STRENGTH
SO'S I DIDN'T
HAVE TO BOTHER YOU.

I DON'T THINK SO,
MR. CARPENTER.
PRINCE, PLEASE.

PLUMB OUT OF SALT.
NOW, THAT'S VEXING.
I'LL GET YOU SOME.
DON'T TROUBLE.
NO TROUBLE. MY CAR'S

WOULDN'T YOU
LIKE A RIDE?
WELL.

IF YOU DON'T SELL,
YOUR KIDS WILL.
WE'LL TALK IT OVER,
I GUESS.

OH, YES.
OF COURSE.
LOOK OVER THERE

THAT'S
THE WORK WE DO--
VACATION HOMES.

RUBY RIDGE?
THAT'S THE OLD

WANT TO LOOK AROUND?
I BELIEVE I WON'T,
THANK YOU.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU,

HOW'S YOUR MOTHER,
BECKY?
SHE'S

I'LL COME SAY HI.
HERE IT IS.
ONE BAG ENOUGH?
LORD, YES.
AND A POUND
OF COFFEE.
I'LL GET IT, MOM.
HI, MRS. BURTON.
HOW YOU FEELING?
FINE, THANKS.
WHY, AUNT ANNIE!
HOLLY.
THIS IS
THE BIG DAY.
DO YOU HAVE
A RIDE TONIGHT?
TONIGHT?
TA-DA!
DILLARD'S CONCERT.
THAT AIN'T DILLARD.
THAT'S
FROM HIS RECORD.
HE SAID THE 30th.
TODAY'S THE 30th,
AUNT ANNIE.
TODAY'S SATURDAY?
SURE IS.
I'VE GOT TO GET HOME
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL DRIVE YOU.
A FELLA OUTSIDE
BRUNG ME DOWN.
NOT PRINCE CARPENTER.
THAT'S HIM.
I'LL DRIVE YOU.
I'D LIKE THAT.
I'LL JUST
THANK HIM.
HI.
DILLARD.
WHERE'S MA?
SHE'S INSIDE.
SHE ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S FINE.
JUST WASHING UP.
YOU LOOK GREAT.
IS CHERYL WITH YOU?
NO.
HOW ARE THE KIDS?
GOT
THEIR MOTHER'S LOOKS
AND THEIR DADDY'S
TALENT.
THEY'LL GO FAR.
SURE IS GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
WOULD YOU
DO SOMETHING FOR ME?
I'LL TRY.
JUST TELL ME
WHO YOU ARE.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.
I GUESS NOT.
RIGHT IN THERE.
I WAS STILL
IN HIGH SCHOOL.
I HAD
A CRUSH ON YOU.
YOU WERE HOME
VISITING,
YOUR PA WAS JUST
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.
I ASKED HIM
IF HE EVER SHOT ANYONE.
I'LL BE DAMNED.
YOU'RE THAT KID
WITH THE TAPE RECORDER.
HOLLY BURRELL.
YOU STILL LIVE HERE?
SURE.
I TAUGHT IN ATLANTA
FOR A WHILE.
NOW I'M BACK
IN HIGH SCHOOL.
WHY DID YOU COME BACK?
JUST LOOK AT IT.
AND THERE
ARE THE KIDS.
I LOVE THEM.
ONCE IN A WHILE,
YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
IS THAT HIM?
HELLO, MA.
I WEREN'T
EXPECTING YOU.
DIDN'T YOU
GET MY LETTER?
I GOT MIXED UP.
YOU PLAYING TONIGHT?
YES, MA'AM.
YOU CAN STAY OVER.
I GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE KIDS.
IT'S A SHORT VISIT
THIS TIME.
I WON'T
CRY ABOUT IT.
I GOT YOU NOW.
I BRUNG YOU
SOME ORANGES.
THEY ARE
REAL PRETTY.
I'M TAKING HER
TO THE CONCERT.
I'D DEARLY
LOVE THAT, HOLLY.
I DEARLY WOULD,
BUT IT'S FAR
FOR OLD BONES LIKE ME,
AND I DON'T BELIEVE
HECTOR WOULD GO.
THE KETTLE'S BOILING.
WANT A CUP OF TEA?
HECTOR.
YEAH. BEEN DEAD
FIVE YEARS.
SHE STILL
HAS HIS CLOTHES
HANGING IN THERE.
HIS TOOLS
UNDER THE BED.
I MOVED THEM ONCE.
SHE PUT THEM
RIGHT BACK.
WHEN PA WAS ALIVE,
SHE'D GET
INTO HER NIGHTGOWN
BEHIND A CURTAIN
IN THE CORNER.
CURTAIN'S
STILL THERE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
YOU KNOW?
IT AIN'T GOOD.
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH HER.
IN THE HEAD,
YOU MEAN?
HELL, NO.
SHE'S CLEARER
THAN I AM.
CUP OF TEA?
NOT FOR ME.
I GOT TO GET ALONG.
YOU CAN'T STAY,
CHILD?
I'LL BE BACK SOON.
NEXT WEEKEND.
YOU DO THAT,
AND STAY OVERNIGHT.
YOU CAN HAVE
DILLARD'S BED.
I GOT
TO WARN YOU.
I SNORE.
THAT WAS
A JOKE, MOM.
YOU TEASE THAT WAY
WITH CHERYL?
NO, MA'AM.
I DON'T TEASE
WITH CHERYL.
WELL, GOOD LUCK
TONIGHT, DILLARD.
SURE YOU WON'T
CHANGE YOUR MIND?
COME ON, MA.
YOU AIN'T SEEN ME
SINCE I WON THAT MEDAL.
HE WERE ONLY 17.
HE WON A PRIZE
AT THE STATE FAIR.
I'M BETTER NOW.
I'LL SING SOMETHING
SPECIAL FOR YOU.
WHAT WOULD I WEAR?
PUT ON YOUR HAT.
PLEASE COME.
I'LL BRING YOU
STRAIGHT HOME.
WELL, I GUESS
IT'D BE ALL RIGHT
JUST THIS ONCE.
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT 7:00.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
I'M FOND OF THAT ONE.
SO...HOW ARE
THE KIDS?
HELLO, MA.
I'M REAL GLAD YOU COME.
THAT COAT'S
GONE AT THE ELBOW.
GIVE IT HERE.
AIN'T ALL THAT'S GONE.
THE KIDS IS FINE.
HECKIE'S LEARNING GUITAR.
THEY SENT YOU
A PRESENT.
I LEFT IT IN THE CAR.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THAT AIN'T ALL
THAT'S GONE?
NOTHING. JUST TALK.
TIME PASSING.
AND HOW'S CHERYL?
CHERYL'S FINE.
DOING GOOD AT WORK.
SHE TROTS AROUND
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.
YOU STILL
TRAVELING A LOT?
WE'RE WORKING
A CLUB IN ORLANDO.
I WANT TO BE CLOSER
TO THE KIDS.
WELL, I'M GLAD OF THAT.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
CERTAIN
AND DECLARE I DO.
I GOT MY HEALTH,
THANK THE LORD.
HOW ABOUT QUITTING
WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD?
QUITTING? HA HA.
COME TO FLORIDA.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SELL THE HOUSE.
COME WHERE I CAN
KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.
DON'T START THAT AGAIN.
THE KIDS
WOULD ENJOY IT.
I BELONG HERE.
COME FOR
THE WINTER THEN.
WHO'D FEED THE CHICKENS?
MA, YOU CAN BUY EGGS.
IT'S PA, AIN'T IT?
NOW, I AIN'T GOING
TO SAY NO PRAYERS.
I JUST WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME.
YOU AIN'T SO YOUNG
ANYMORE.
YOU'RE UP HERE
ALL ON YOUR OWN.
SUPPOSING YOU HAD
AN ACCIDENT?
YOU LET PA REST.
COME LIVE WITH US.
YOU AIN'T LOOKED
SO SERIOUS
SINCE YOU TALKED
ABOUT YOUR MUSIC.
I AIN'T TALKING
ABOUT MUSIC NOW.
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR PA RESTING,
AND HE IS,
RIGHT HERE,
IN THE ORCHARD
WITH HIS PARENTS
AND YOUR LITTLE
BROTHER AND SISTER.
WHEN MY TIME COMES,
I'M GOING TO LAY BESIDE HIM,
AND NOTHING'S GOING
TO CHANGE THAT--
NOT YOU, NOR FLORIDA,
NOR NOTHING.
YOUR ELBOW'S
DIGGING INTO MY KNEE.
YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE.
I'D SLEEP BETTER
IF'N YOU WAS
OFF THIS MOUNTAIN.
I AIN'T SLEPT IN ANOTHER
BED SINCE I MARRIED.
I AIN'T ABOUT TO.
I AIN'T
GIVING UP ON IT.
I SWEAR
I'M GOING TO KEEP
AFTER YOU.
HERE...
IT'S DONE.
THANKS, MA.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE SMOKEHOUSE?
ROOF GIVE UP.
WANT I
SHOULD FIX IT?
IT'S SPENT ITS DAYS.
YOUR PA BUILT THAT
FIRST YEAR
WE WAS MARRIED.
THAT'S 60 YEARS AGO.
60 YEARS.
YOU WAS 18?
WHAT WERE
YOU LIKE, MA?
SCARED.
I WERE ONLY 16
WHEN HE ASKED ME
TO MARRY HIM.
HE WAS SCARED, TOO.
IT WAS AT
A CORN-SHUCKING.
REMEMBER THEM?
THAT CORN PILE
ON THE GROUND
AND FIDDLES PLAYING.
THEY BURIED LIQUOR
IN THE CORN.
THE MEN MOVED
FOR THAT.
WHOEVER FOUND
A RED EAR FIRST
GOT TO KISS
THE PRETTIEST GAL.
ANYWAY, YOUR PA...
SOMETIMES STAY WITH YOU
JUST SO CLEAR,
LIKE THEY
WAS STILL HAPPENING.
I REMEMBER
WE WAS ALL OVER
THE NORTONS' BIG BARN.
THE MUSIC WAS A-PLAYING,
AND EVERYONE WAS A-DANCING.
AIN'T YOU GOING
TO DANCE?
I GOT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
I OUGHT TO GO BACK.
NO. NO, NO. WAIT.
THEY'LL NOTICE.
LET THEM.
LOOSE ME,
PLEASE, HECTOR.
SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GRAB AT YOU.
WELL, WHAT IS IT, THEN?
THAT RED EAR.
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I DIDN'T FIND IT.
I ONLY MADE OUT
I DID.
I KNOWED THAT.
YOU DID?
I SEEN YOU TAKE IT
OUT OF YOUR POCKET.
OH.
ANNIE...
I'M WORKING
PRETTY REGULAR...
WHEN I CAN GET IT.
I'LL HAVE MY DADDY'S
HOMEPLACE SOMEDAY.
IT'S GOOD LAND.
I AIM
TO SETTLE DOWN.
YOU SHOULD, HECTOR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
RAISE A FAMILY.
IT AIN'T MEN
RAISES FAMILIES.
WELL,
THAT'S JUST IT.
YOU'RE AWFUL PRETTY.
I'M STILL TO SCHOOL,
HECTOR.
I GOT TO GO BACK.
I CAN WAIT.
YOU GOT MY ARM
AGAIN.
I KNOW.
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR IT.
ANNIE...
WILL YOU?
WELL?
I'M SCARED, HECTOR.
WHAT OF?
YOU.
ME?
OH, I LIKE YOU, BUT...
BUT WHAT?
YOU'RE TOO...
TOO HASTY.
WELL, I CAN CHANGE!
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
"I'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOU."
HOW LONG DID YOU
MAKE HIM WAIT?
TWO YEARS.
AND HE CHANGED?
NO, BUT HE WAITED.
SMART MAN.
LUCKY MAN.
I GOT TO WATCH
THE CLOCK.
THIS THING'S SLOW.
WHAT ABOUT
ALL THEM ORANGES?
WE SHOULD HAVE
GIVE SOME TO HOLLY.
PUT THEM IN
THE CELLAR FOR ME.
GIVE ME
A COUPLE FIRST.
YOU WANT ONE?
MA, IF I NEVER SEE
ANOTHER ORANGE
IN MY LIFE,
IT'LL BE TOO SOON.
THEY'RE A REAL TREAT
TO ME.
WHO BUSTED THIS DOOR?
IT GOT STUCK.
WE HAD A LONG WET
SPELL LAST MONTH.
DOOR SWOLL UP.
WENT TO GET BEANS
FOR SUPPER.
COULDN'T OPEN IT.
FELT RIGHT FOOLISH.
YOU HAD
A TOUGH JOB GETTING IN.
I WAS ALREADY IN.
HOW DO YOU MEAN?
INSIDE.
DOOR SHUT BEHIND ME.
HOW DID YOU GET OUT?
JOE NORTON COME UP
NEXT MORNING
TO CUT WOOD FOR ME.
HEARD ME HOLLERING.
I'LL PUT THESE INSIDE
AND LOOK TO THE TIME
FOR YOU.
YOU WAS IN THERE
ALL NIGHT?
DARK NEVER
HURT NO ONE.
YOU COULD'VE
GOTTEN PNEUMONIA.
I HAD YOUR
PA'S SWEATER ON.
WHAT IF JOE HADN'T COME?
GUESS I'D STILL
BE HOLLERING.
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.
YOU COULD'VE DIED.
NOBODY WOULD KNOW.
FOLKS ALWAYS
COME VISITING.
ONCE A WEEK?
ONCE A MONTH?
YOU'RE THE THIRD PERSON
TO COME HERE TODAY.
HOW MANY TIMES
DOES THAT HAPPEN?
YOU COULD
BREAK YOUR NECK,
AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW.
ALL 'CAUSE OF PA!
HI.
HI.
MRS. NATIONS AROUND?
SHE'S IN THE HOUSE.
THAT HILL
SURE TELLS YOU
IF YOU'RE IN SHAPE.
YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?
NOPE.
BRING THEM WITH YOU?
YEP.
FLORIDA, HUH?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU BOYS REALLY
MOVING IN HERE,
AIN'T YOU?
YOU INTERESTED
IN THIS PLACE?
YEAH, I'M INTERESTED.
WELL, MEET
THE COMPETITION.
I'M MOUNTAIN PEAK
DEVELOPMENT.
PRINCE CARPENTER.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
I'VE HAD MY EYE
ON THIS PLACE
FOR A LONG TIME.
IT'S NO SALE, THOUGH.
YOU EVER TALK
TO THE OLD MAN?
YEAH, I TALKED TO HIM.
HOW DID YOU DO?
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN
TO HIM RECENTLY.
WON'T BUDGE.
AIN'T NEVER
GOING TO SELL.
HE TELL YOU THAT?
RIGHT HERE
ON THIS PORCH.
HOW DID YOU
MANAGE THAT?
IT WEREN'T EASY.
GUESS NOT.
MY PA'S BEEN DEAD
FIVE YEARS.
COME AGAIN?
MY PA.
HE DIED.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
FIVE YEARS AGO.
YOU MUST BE THE SON
IN SHOW BUSINESS--
DILLARD.
I AIN'T
IN REAL ESTATE.
GOT AHEAD OF MYSELF.
SMART MAN, YOUR PA.
I TALKED TO HIM
JUST BEFORE
HE PASSED OVER.
YOU DID, HUH?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOUR MA REMEMBERS.
OFFERED HIM 100,000
FOR THIS PLACE.
HE WOULDN'T TOUCH IT.
HE KNEW VALUES INCREASE.
YOU THINK THAT'S
THE ONLY REASON?
OFFERED YOUR MA 200.
YOU WON'T BUDGE MA,
NEITHER.
I SURE CAN'T.
LOOK, MR. CARPENTER--
CALL ME PRINCE.
MY GRANDDADDY
CLEARED THIS LAND.
MY PA WORKED IT,
I WORKED IT,
MY MA LIVES HERE.
IT MUST GET
MIGHTY LONELY UP HERE.
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
SHE BROUGHT BACK
YOUR PA.
YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?
THIS IS MY TERRITORY.
YOU DIDN'T CALL HER
ON IT?
I WASN'T ABOUT
TO SPOIL ANYTHING
FOR A FINE OLD LADY.
THINK IT OVER.
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR BREATH.
IT AIN'T
MY LAND,
AND IT AIN'T
MY LIFE.
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED
SINCE WE GREW UP
IN THESE MOUNTAINS.
ALL THE KIDS
WITH GET-UP-AND-GO
GOT UP AND WENT,
JUST LIKE YOU DID.
THE OLD ONES HANG ON
LIKE FOXFIRE
ON ROTTEN WOOD.
MR. CARPENTER.
PRINCE, PLEASE.
AUNT ANNIE,
I BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT.
BE CAREFUL.
IT'S SHARP,
AND I KNOW YOU NEED
A SHARP KNIFE.
NO, I WON'T
HEAR A WORD.
JUST TAKE IT SLOW
NEXT TIME
YOU CUT OUT AN EYE.
I CAN'T LET YOU--
YOU'LL HAVE
TO GIVE ME A PENNY.
MY GRANNY
USED TO SAY,
YOU CAN'T GIVE
A BODY NOTHING
WITH A SHARP EDGE,
OR IT WILL
CUT THE FRIENDSHIP.
PAY A PENNY,
KEEP A FRIEND.
DILLARD,
YOU GOT A PENNY?
I'M ALL OUT.
THERE.
THERE'S BAND-AIDS
IN THE BAG,
JUST IN CASE.
WELL, THANK YOU KINDLY.
MR. CARPENTER
WAS JUST LEAVING.
YEAH, GOT TO BE
GETTING ALONG,
BUT I'LL BE BACK.
TIME'S A-MARCHING.
BYE, MA'AM.
DILLARD.
MA, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME
THAT FELLOW HAD BEEN
POKING AROUND?
IT WOULDN'T HAVE
CHANGED NOTHING.
HE TOLD ME
HE TALKED TO PA.
HE DID?
WELL, MAYBE HE DID.
THAT AIN'T
A GOOD MAN
TO DO BUSINESS WITH.
WHAT DID HE SAY
TO YOU?
CALLED ME
A SENIOR CITIZEN.
SAID IF WE
DIDN'T SELL,
YOU WOULD.
WHAT THE HELL'S
HE MEAN?
IT'S YOUR LAND!
DON'T SWEAR, SON.
HE WASN'T SO FAR OFF.
IT'LL BE COMING TO YOU
ONE DAY ANYWAY.
WHAT ABOUT MILLIE
AND JED?
YOU KNOW THEY AIN'T
NEVER COMING BACK.
I'D GIVE IT TO YOU NOW
IF I THOUGHT YOU
COULD USE IT.
HELL, MA,
DON'T LAY THAT--
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO SWEAR.
I DO LOVE
THIS PLACE,
BUT I CAN'T
LIVE HERE.
NO, YOU NEVER COULD
ONCE YOU WAS GROWED.
THINGS DON'T WORK OUT,
DO THEY?
WHAT'S TROUBLING YOU,
DILLARD?
NOTHING.
JUST LIVING.
I BEST GET STARTED.
IF I'M NOT
THERE TO SET UP,
THEY'LL BE FUSSING.
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER,
THEN.
IF THAT
REAL ESTATE MAN
COMES AROUND AGAIN,
DON'T TALK TO HIM.
I'LL TALK
TO YOUR PA.
OF COURSE YOU WILL.
GIVE THE KIDS
MY LOVE.
I WON'T FORGET.
I'LL GIVE YOURS
TO YOUR PA.
NEVER MIND THAT.
JUST GO ON.
YOU AIN'T MAD AT ME?
I AIN'T MAD
AT A SOUL IN THIS WORLD.
YOU KISSED ME GOOD
WHEN YOU COME.
I JUST HATE GOODBYES.
KISS ME
WHEN YOU COME AGAIN.
O.K.
I WON'T TRY SEEING
YOU AFTER THE SHOW.
I GOT TO
GET TO ATLANTA,
CATCH THAT PLANE.
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
I'LL CLAP REAL LOUD.
I'M SORRY
IT WAS SO SHORT.
I'LL WRITE
WHEN I GET BACK.
DON'T YOU GO CLOSING
NO DOORS ON YOURSELF.
HE SENT YOU HIS LOVE.
I HEARED.
SOMETHING'S WRONG,
HECTOR.
HE WANTED YOU TO GO
LIVE WITH HIM AGAIN?
THAT'S IT, AIN'T IT?
COME TO FLORIDA.
WELL, I AIN'T GOING.
HE AIN'T ASKED YOU.
YOU GOING TO LEAVE ME?
YOU'RE TOO OLD
FOR THAT NOW.
WHAT I'M TOO OLD FOR,
I'LL DECIDE.
DILLARD'S GOING THROUGH
ROUGH WATERS.
WE DID, TOO.
TIMES IS DIFFERENT.
THEY AIN'T HARDER.
LIKE THE BIBLE SAYS,
"MAN IS BORN
INTO TROUBLE."
NOT JUST TO
PICKING A BANJO.
HECTOR,
THE LORD FORGIVE ME,
BUT SOMETIMES
I GET TIRED
OF WHAT
THE BIBLE SAYS.
AND IT AIN'T
A BANJO,
IT'S A GUITAR.
AND I'M GOING TO SEE
HIM PLAY IT TONIGHT.
A-1, 2...
A-1, 2, 3.

MY PA WAS BORN JUST
A CAT'S JUMP FROM HERE.
HE WAS
A GOOD OLD BOY.
HE COULD SING.
HE DIDN'T SOUND
NO BETTER THAN A CROW.
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
GOT ME STARTED.
THAT AND AN OLD BANJO
MY PA GOT TRADING.
MY PA WAS A TRADING MAN.
ONE STEP AHEAD
OF THE SHERIFF.
HE'D SWAP YOU SILLY.
YOU'D BE LUCKY TO
WALK AWAY WEARING A SHIRT.
I WROTE A SONG
ABOUT PA
AND HIS TRADING.
WE'D LIKE TO SING IT.
IT'S CALLED SWEET TALKER.
%% SWEET TALKER %%
%% PA WAS A TRADIN' MAN %%
%% MY PA WAS A FARMER %%
%% FOR 50 CENTS A DAY %%

YEAH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
IT SURE IS NICE TO BE
BACK IN RABUN COUNTY.
I TELL YOU,
THESE MOUNTAINS,
THEY DON'T NEVER LET YOU GO.
I'M JUST AN OLD
HILLBILLY BOY AT HEART.
OH, PLEASE.
MY MA'S OUT THERE TONIGHT
WITH A PRETTY GAL,
NAME OF HOLLY BURRELL.
HOLLY'S A SCHOOLTEACHER,
BUT SHE DON'T LOOK IT.
[LAUGHTER]
WE WAS VISITING
THIS AFTERNOON,
AND THEY ASKED ME
IF I'D SING A SONG
FROM MY ALBUM.
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT.
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S
SOME FOR SALE DOWN THERE.
ANYWAY, HERE'S ANOTHER
DILLARD NATIONS ORIGINAL,
CALLED MY FEET
TOOK TO WALKIN'.
%% SURE, I REMEMBER
THE HOMEPLACE %%
%% SURE, I REMEMBER
IT CLEAR %%
%% BECAUSE THE DAY
THAT I LEFT HER %%
%% WAS JUST
THIS TIME OF YEAR %%
%% I CAN SEE HER SMILE %%
%% ALMOST EVERY MILE %%
%% BUT MY FEET
TOOK TO WALKIN' %%
%% MY FEET
TOOK TO WALKIN' %%
%% NO SENSE
IN TALKIN' IT OUT %%
%% ALL THE DREAMS
THAT NEVER WERE %%
%% TILL MY FEET
TOOK TO WALKIN' AWAY %%
%% FROM HER %%%%
YEAH.
THAT WAS REAL GOOD
OF YOU TO TAKE ME.
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.
THEY SURE DID CLAP
ANYWAY.
ALL THAT WHOOPING
AND HOLLERING.
THEY LOVED IT.
I GOT A HEADACHE.
I AIN'T HAD ONE
IN YEARS.
GOT SOME ASPIRIN?
I'LL JUST HAVE SOME TEA
AND GET TO BED.
I'LL PUT
THE KETTLE ON.
OH, THANK YOU, CHILD.
YOU'VE HAD
A LONG DAY.
I WISH HE DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO UP
IN A PLANE.
BETTER THAN
DRIVING ALL NIGHT.
HECTOR NEVER DID
HOLD WITH FLYING.
SAID IT WAS
AGIN' NATURE.
IF THE LORD
MEANT US TO FLY,
HE'D HAVE GIVE US WINGS.
NEVER GIVE US
WHEELS, NEITHER.
YOU BEEN GONE
FOUR HOURS.
I KNOW.
FIRST TIME
IN FIVE YEARS.
YOU FORGOT THE CHICKENS,
AND YOU AIN'T
HAD NO SUPPER.
I ATE A HOT DOG...
AND POPCORN.
HOLLY BOUGHT IT.
YOUNG'UNS TODAY
GOT MORE MONEY
THAN SENSE.
YOU BOUGHT ME ICE CREAM
WHEN WE WAS COURTING.
ONLY A NICKEL THEN.
I WISH
YOU'D BEEN THERE.
HAD TO LIGHT THE STOVE.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
YOU LEAVE...
THE FIRE GOES OUT.
MA!
MA!
WELL?
HOW'D YOU LIKE IT?
I THOUGHT YOU
WAS FLYING BACK.
I CHANGED MY MIND.
CATCH A PLANE TOMORROW.
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
IT WERE REAL NICE.
YEAH.
GIVE YOU A HEADACHE.
THAT FIDDLER
WERE GOOD.
REMINDED ME
OF OLD TIMES.
WHAT SONG
DID YOU LIKE BEST?
THEY WAS ALL GOOD.
YOU WORKED SO HARD.
I COULD SEE THE SWEAT
RUNNING DOWN YOU.
GETS HOT.
I'LL WASH THAT SHIRT.
TOMORROW.
MAYBE THAT'S BEST.
I AIN'T HAD SUCH
A BIG DAY IN YEARS.
I'LL JUST DRAW
SOME WATER
FOR THE MORNING.
I'M DOING THAT.
OH, THANK YOU, CHILD.
YOUR BED'S MADE UP.
YOUR PA WOULD HAVE
BEEN PROUD OF YOU, BOY.
NOW, I'M GOING TO
HAVE MY TEA.
SHE'S WORN OUT.
WHAT DID SHE
REALLY THINK?
OH, SHE WAS EXCITED.
BUT WHAT DID
SHE THINK?
SHE THOUGHT
IT WAS...LOUD.
IT WAS, TOO.
IT'S GOT TO BE,
OR THEY DON'T FIGURE
THEY GOT THEIR
MONEY'S WORTH.
WHAT ELSE?
WELL...
LOUD AND, UH...
JOKEY.
DILLARD,
I'M NO CRITIC.
WELL, WHAT DIDN'T
YOU LIKE?
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU.
US'UNS DOWN HERE
IN GOOD OLD
RABUN COUNTY
AIN'T
ALL HILLBILLIES.
I AM.
UP THERE I AM.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.
THAT'S FOR MY CUSTOMERS.
DO YOU HAVE TO DRESS
LIKE A STOP SIGN?
IT'S THE IMAGE.
IT'S NOT YOU.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ME?
WE COME FROM
THE SAME PLACE,
AND WE DON'T TALK
LIKE L'IL ABNER.
MAKING YOUR DADDY
A JOKE.
HOW COULD YOU?
YOU'RE A SINGER.
YOU SOUNDED
LIKE A SALESMAN.
I'M SWEET-TALKING,
LIKE MY PA.
HE SAID,
"YOU MAKE MONEY
ANY WAY YOU CAN."
HE MADE IT
BY PLAIN HARD WORK.
YOUR DADDY WASN'T
ALL SWEET TALK.
NOW, DILLARD,
I'M SORRY
FOR SOUNDING OFF
ABOUT YOUR CONCERT.
I JUST LIKE HOW
YOU USED TO SING--
JUST YOUR VOICE
AND THE GUITAR.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
WOULDN'T PAY THE RENT.
GIVE ME A HAND?
WHAT'S THAT?
HECKIE AND SUSIE.
PRESENT FOR
THEIR GRANDMA.
SUPPOSED TO BE
THE FIRST THING
SHE SEES
WHEN SHE WAKES UP.
I COULDN'T FORGET.
YOU SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT THEM.
CHERYL, TOO.
YOU DON'T KNOW CHERYL.
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?
FASTEST CREDIT CARD
IN THE SOUTH.
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
NOTHING.
CHERYL'S A CITY GAL.
SHE LIKES THINGS EASY.
MA COULD USE
SOME OF THAT.
WISH I COULD GET HER
TO FLORIDA.
TO LIVE?
YOU KNOW A FELLA
NAMED PRINCE CARPENTER?
WE'VE MET. WHY?
HE WAS HERE TODAY.
MADE AN OFFER
FOR THE PLACE.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
HIM AND
HIS RUBY RIDGE.
YOU KNOW
THAT DEVELOPMENT?
WELL, SURE.
I WAS BORN
OVER THERE.
FOUR GENERATIONS,
WE FARMED THAT LAND.
THEN MA DIED.
PRINCE CARPENTER
TALKED MY DADDY
INTO SELLING OUT.
THEY BUILT HOMES
FOR SUMMER PEOPLE
ALL OVER
OUR MOUNTAIN.
BARBED WIRE TO KEEP
THE HILLBILLIES OUT.
THOSE KIDS I TEACH,
I WANT THEM
SMART ENOUGH
TO KEEP THEIR LAND,
'CAUSE
ONCE IT'S GONE,
YOU CAN NEVER
GET IT BACK.
DON'T LET
AUNT ANNIE SELL.
DON'T LET PRINCE
SHOVE HER OUT.
MA DON'T SHOVE EASY.
SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE WANTS.
ALWAYS DID.
SO DID PA.
TWO PEOPLE
AND A PIECE OF GROUND.
THAT'S ALL IT TOOK.
DON'T LET HER SELL
THE PIECE OF GROUND.
IT AIN'T THAT SIMPLE.
NO.
I SUPPOSE IT COULD
HELP YOU A LOT,
YOU AND CHERYL.
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
TWO KIDS
TO TAKE CARE OF.
HER WORKING,
YOU TRAVELING
ALL THE TIME.
IF I WANTED SOMEONE
TO WATCH MY KIDS,
IT WOULDN'T BE
A 79-YEAR-OLD WOMAN,
NEVER BEEN IN
A SUPERMARKET OR A BUS.
THERE WOULD BE SOMEONE
TO LOOK AFTER HER.
SHE'D BE SAFE.
SAFE FROM WHAT?
THIS IS HER HOME,
DILLARD.
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
HOW IT FEELS.
NO, I AIN'T.
SHE'S LIVED HERE
ALL HER LIFE.
THIS ISN'T
SUCH A BAD PLACE
TO DIE.
ALL ALONE UP HERE?
SHE'S GOT GOOD FRIENDS,
MORE THAN SHE'D HAVE
IN FLORIDA.
THE NORTONS, ME,
LOTS OF PEOPLE.
SHE HAS YOUR PA.
COME OFF IT.
HE AIN'T REAL.
SO WHAT?
MAYBE HE MEANS
MORE TO HER THAN
INDOOR PLUMBING.
MA'S ALIVE,
AND SO'S HER FAMILY.
I JUST MEAN,
DON'T PUSH TOO HARD,
DILLARD.
I KNOW YOU LOVE HER,
BUT IS LEAVING HERE
WHAT SHE WANTS
OR YOU WANT?
NOW, THAT'S MY BUSINESS,
AIN'T IT?
YES, IT IS.
IT'S YOUR BUSINESS.
GOOD NIGHT, DILLARD.
AND I STILL LIKE HOW
YOU USED TO SING.
[GUITAR PLAYS]
%% SURE, I REMEMBER
THE HOMEPLACE %%
%% SURE, I REMEMBER
IT CLEAR %%
%% BECAUSE THE DAY
THAT I LEFT HER %%
%% WAS JUST
THIS TIME OF YEAR %%
%% I CAN SEE HER SMILE %%
%% ALMOST EVERY MILE %%
%% BUT MY FEET
TOOK TO WALKIN' %%
%% MY FEET
TOOK TO WALKIN' %%
%% THERE'S NO SENSE
IN TALKIN' IT OUT %%
%% ALL THE DREAMS %%
%% THAT NEVER WERE %%
YOU BEEN AWAKE
ALL NIGHT.
SOME OF IT.
WHY DID HE STAY?
I AIN'T ASKED.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
HE WANTS
TO GET RID OF ME.
HE CAN'T DO THAT.
NO...
BUT YOU CAN.
MA?
OH!
WHAT ARE THEM?
CUTOUTS.
THE GRANDCHILDREN.
ONE OF THEM
GOT A GIMPY LEG?
OF COURSE NOT.
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY
NEXT WEEK.
WHOSE?
SUSIE'S.
DILLARD'S YOUNGEST.
OH.
WELL...
BIRTHDAYS DON'T MEAN
SO MUCH TO ME NO MORE.
NO. NEVER DID.
MORNING, MA.
I'M SO PROUD OF THESE.
IT WAS ALL
THEIR OWN IDEA.
YOU REMIND ME--
I GOT A LITTLE BIRTHDAY
SOMETHING FOR SUSIE.
SHE'LL BE TICKLED.
NICE SMELL.
JUST COFFEE.
NOT THE COFFEE.
THIS PLACE.
WHY DID YOU
COME BACK?
WHY DID I COME HOME?
YOU TOLD ME
YOU HAD TO GET BACK
TO THE CHILDREN.
I DO.
I NEEDED TO TALK
TO YOU.
DID YOU CALL CHERYL?
NOT YET.
WON'T SHE WORRY?
NO.
I WOULD.
SHE AIN'T THERE, MA.
WHERE'S SHE AT?
SHE'S AWAY.
WHERE'S HECKIE
AND SUSIE?
STAYING WITH FRIENDS.
THAT SIDE DOOR
NEEDS FIXING.
MA...
WHEN YOU TALK TO PA,
CAN YOU SEE HIM?
CLEAR AS CLEAR.
IS HE THERE?
I'M HERE.
SOMETIMES.
CAN YOU TOUCH HIM?
YOUR PA WEREN'T
MUCH FOR TOUCHING.
YOU HAD FIVE KIDS,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
FOR THE LORD'S SAKE.
AND FOR MINE
AND YOUR PA'S
AND FOR THIS PLACE.
DID YOU ALWAYS
LOVE HIM?
WE WAS MARRIED.
NO, NOT ALWAYS.
SOMETIMES
I NEAR HATED HIM.
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
TO HEAR THIS.
BUT YOU STUCK
WITH HIM.
ALL THAT TIME,
NO MATTER WHAT.
PA WAS SMART
TO WAIT HIS TWO YEARS.
YOU GOING TO TELL ME
ABOUT CHERYL?
WHAT'S TO TELL?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT SOMETHING.
SHE'S GONE, MA.
GONE?
TOOK OFF.
LEFT.
TWO WEEKS AGO.
WHY?
LOTS OF REASONS.
YOU STRIKE HER?
NO, MA'AM!
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.
ANOTHER MAN?
YEP.
OH.
SHE TAKE THE CHILDREN?
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ROOM
IN THE TRUNK.
SHE WANTS A DIVORCE.
SHE GOT HERSELF
A LAWYER.
WELL! WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT?
I AIN'T GOING TO LET
HER HAVE MY KIDS.
HER KIDS, TOO.
SHE QUIT. I DIDN'T.
HOW WILL YOU CARE
FOR TWO YOUNG'UNS?
I'LL WORK
SOMETHING OUT.
THEY'RE ALL I GOT,
AND DAMN IT,
I'M THEIR PA.
BUT YOU GOT NO WIFE,
NO REAL HOME.
I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.
I CAN'T COME BACK HERE.
YOU WANT I
SHOULD GO THERE?
NO. WELL, YES! I DO.
I'VE BEEN TRYING
FOR YEARS,
BUT NOT
TO BAIL ME OUT.
I WANT YOU
TO BE SAFE.
I'M SCARED OF THAT
PHONE CALL TELLS ME
TO CARRY YOU OUT
OF HERE FEET FIRST.
IT AIN'T ME,
IT'S YOU.
YOU CAN'T
MAKE IT ALONE,
AND PA'S DEAD.
DAMN IT! HOW DO I
GET THROUGH TO YOU?
HE'S DEAD, MA.
DILLARD, HONEY...
DON'T YOU NEVER
HEAR HIM
IN YOUR HEAD?
ALL THE TIME,
TELLING ME THINGS
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR.
I REMEMBER
THEM THINGS.
FIRST IT WAS
YOUR BROTHER,
THEN YOUR SISTER,
THEN YOU WAS
THE ONLY ONE LEFT.
HE NEVER MEANT NO HARM.
HE JUST SAW EVERYTHING
HIS OWN WAY,
LIKE YOU BUMPING HEADS
WITH HIM WHEN YOU WAS 16.
YOU DONE
LIKE I TOLD YOU?
WHAT'S THAT?
CHECK
THE PLANT CALENDAR.
NOT YET.
"A FOOL DESPISES
HIS FATHER'S INSTRUCTION."
PROVERBS15.
SET THAT TO MUSIC.
I AIN'T HEARED
THAT BEFORE.
IT'S CALLED
RESURRECTION.
YOU MAKE IT UP?
NAH. MR. WILSON.
HE'S GOOD.
ONLY THREE EGGS?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT AILS
THEM CHICKENS.
THE STORE'S GOT EGGS.
YOU KNOW WE DON'T
SPEND MONEY THAT WAY.
IF THEY AIN'T
GOOD ONE ROAD,
THEY'RE GOOD ANOTHER.
I'LL BUY THEM
FOR YOU--THE EGGS.
YOU WILL?
FOR A PRESENT.
HA!
MA, I MADE $5.00.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
PLAYING
AT THE DANCE.
DON'T YOU TELL YOUR PA.
I WON'T.
THAT'S REAL SWEET
OF YOU, HONEY,
WANTING TO BUY US
A PRESENT.
IT'S FOR YOU, NOT HIM.
DILLARD, HONEY,
YOU BE GOOD NOW.
YOUR PA'S WORE OUT
WITH ONLY ONE PAIR
OF HANDS AROUND HERE.
I'M PAINTING
THE BARN TOMORROW.
GIVE IT HERE.
WHERE'S THE GLASSES?
YOU DONE YOUR CHORES?
YEP.
WHAT?
YES, PA...
SIR.
DON'T MUMBLE.
ALL OF THEM?
I CHOPPED THE WOOD,
FILLED THE BUCKETS,
WATERED THE STOCK,
MUCKED OUT
THE STALL,
AND COLLECTED
THE EGGS.
THERE WAS
ONLY THREE.
HARDLY WORTH THE FEED.
GET TO BED EARLY TONIGHT.
GOT TO GET THEM TATERS
IN THIS WEEKEND.
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
THE BARN PAINTED.
NOT TOMORROW.
WE GOT ALL WEEK
TO PLANT TATERS.
NO, WE AIN'T.
IT'S A NEW MOON WEDNESDAY.
WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE
PLANTED THEM TODAY.
SIGNS WAS
IN THE FEET TODAY.
OH, PA, WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?
DILLARD...
IT'S
OLD-TIMEY TALK.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?
NOTHING.
GET IT STRAIGHT NOW.
YOU ALWAYS PLANT TATERS
IN THE LAST QUARTER.
YOU PLANT IN THE LIGHT
OF THE MOON--
ALL VINE, NO TATER.
ANY FOOL KNOWS THAT.
YES, PA.
PEOPLE'S BEEN GOING
BY THE SIGNS
FOR A LONG TIME.
I KNOW.
WE NEVER KILL A HOG
ON THE NEW OF THE MOON.
CRACKLINGS COME OUT
SOFT AND PUFFY.
I CAN SEE BELIEVING
IN THE MOON.
MR. WILSON SAYS
IT MAKES THE TIDES,
BUT THERE AIN'T NO
SCIENTIFIC PROOFS
FOR PLANTING
BY THE SIGNS.
WILSON. THAT THE FELLA
WITH THE BEARD AND GLASSES?
YES, SIR.
HE PLAYS
GUITAR, TOO,
REAL GOOD.
WHAT'S HE KNOW
ABOUT FARMING?
WELL, HE'S ONLY
THE COUNTY AGENT.
HE TEACHES A COURSE
AND SAYS
THERE AIN'T
NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF
FOR PLANTING
BY THE SIGNS.
HE DOES, DOES HE?
CAN HE STAND AN EGG
ON ITS END?
WHAT?
HERE.
STAND THIS
ON ITS END.
YOU CAN'T.
GO AHEAD, BOY.
NO ONE CAN.
YOU MEAN,
MR. WILSON SAYS
THERE AIN'T
NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF?
NOW,
WHAT DO YOU
CALL THAT?
A SPOILED EGG.
YOU CHEATED.
I USED THE SENSE
THAT GOD GAVE ME.
INGENESIS, IT SAYS,
"LET THERE BE LIGHT
IN THE FIRMAMENT
"TO DIVIDE
NIGHT FROM DAY,
AND LET THEM BE
FOR SIGNS."
THAT'S WHAT
THE LORD SAID.
HE DIDN'T SAY
TO WASTE EGGS.
I'M TEACHING HIM
SOMETHING.
MR. WILSON'S
FARMED FOR 20 YEARS
WITHOUT USING SIGNS.
HIS YIELD'S
AS HIGH AS ANYONE'S.
I'M TIRED OF HIS NAME.
HE PLANTS
BY THE WEATHER
AND THE SEASONS.
AND I PLANT
BY WHAT CONTROLS
THE WEATHER AND THE SEASONS.
OH, PA!
DON'T "OH, PA" ME!
GET THAT KNOW-ALL
OUT OF YOUR VOICE!
YOU CAN'T
PROVE IT, PA!
DON'T TELL ME
I AIN'T PROVED IT.
YOU BEEN GETTING WAY
ABOVE YOURSELF LATELY,
MAKING LIKE
WE KNOW NOTHING.
WE KNOW A DAMN SIGHT MORE
THAN YOUR FRIENDS!
THERE'S NO NEED TO CUSS.
AIN'T NO NEED
FOR US TO SPAT,
NEITHER,
BUT THIS
IS MY HOUSE.
IF I HAVE TO CUSS,
I'LL CUSS.
I'VE BEEN WORKING
THIS LAND 35 YEARS.
YOU LEARN IT
BY DOING IT!
YOU WANT
TO STUDY FARMING,
YOU KEEP YOUR EYES
OPEN RIGHT HERE.
SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME
I TURN AROUND,
YOU'RE PICKIN'
AT THAT THING.
THAT AIN'T
NO FIT OCCUPATION
FOR A MAN.
I MADE $5.00
PICKING AT IT!
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
HECTOR.
YOU OUGHT TO
LOOK TO BEAUTY.
WHAT?
THE MARE.
HER KNEE'S BAD.
HOW DID YOU
MAKE $5.00?
SHE CAN'T
HARDLY STAND.
HOW'D YOU MAKE IT?
PLAYING
AT THE DANCE.
SATURDAY NIGHT?
YES, SIR.
YOU TOLD ME YOU WAS
GOING COON HUNTING.
YES, SIR.
YOU SAID YOU
NEVER EVEN SEEN A COON.
THAT WAS TRUE, PA.
I WISH YOU'D
LOOK TO BEAUTY.
SHE'LL WAIT!
YOU TOLD ME...
A BAREFACED LIE.
YES, SIR.
BAREFACED LIE.
WHAT WILL WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW, PA.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT WE'LL DO.
YOU TAKE THIS
'ROUND TO THAT WILLOW
BY THE SPRINGHOUSE.
YOU CUT ME A LIMB
ABOUT 3 FEET LONG...
THE SIZE OF YOUR FINGER.
DON'T DO IT, HECTOR.
NOW,
YOU KNOW BETTER.
I DON'T DO IT,
HE PAYS FOR IT.
HE'S ONLY A BOY.
THAT'S JUST IT.
I WON'T HAVE HIM
RUN AROUND
DRINKING, CUSSING,
CHASING GIRLS.
YOU DONE
ALL THEM THINGS!
WHEN?
WHEN I FIRST
KNOWED YOU.
I WAS GROWED,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.
YOU STILL CUSS
AND DRINK SOME.
I EXPECT HIM TO DO
A DAMN SIGHT BETTER
THAN I DONE.
HE KNOWS THE RULES.
YOU ALWAYS BEEN
TOO SOFT ON HIM.
LIKE I WAS ON JED?
OH, JED.
JED WAS JUST
PLAIN MULE-MINDED.
THEY'RE BOTH YOUR SONS.
WE AIN'T SEEN
HIDE NOR HAIR
OF ONE IN EIGHT YEARS.
WHICH FINGER
DID YOU USE?
YOU DIDN'T SAY
MY THUMB.
COME ON OUT BACK.
WE AIN'T SHAMING YOU
IN FRONT OF YOUR MA.
DILLARD, TALK TO HIM!
DON'T GO ON ABOUT MUSIC!
HERE. TAKE HIM
HIS PLANTING CALENDAR.
COME ON, BOY!
LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.
[WHIP]
[WHIP]
[WHIP]
[WHIP]
IT'S DONE.
"AS THE TWIG IS BENT,
SO WILL THE TREE GROW."
YOU JUST BROKE IT.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
I'LL GO LOOK
TO THAT MARE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
YOU SAID
HER LEG WAS BAD.
I LIED.
YOU GOING TO
WHUP ME, TOO?
I'LL GO LOOK
TO HER ANYWAY.
I'M RIGHT SORRY
FOR YOU, HECTOR!
FELT SORRY FOR YOU, TOO.
HE DIDN'T HURT ME.
I HAD THAT OLD
PLANTING CALENDAR
STUCK DOWN
MY BRITCHES.
MAYBE IT DID HURT.
BEEN SO LONG AGO, I
CAN'T REMEMBER NOTHING,
EXCEPT HOW MAD I WAS.
I HATED HIM...
AND I LOVED HIM.
REMEMBER WHEN JED QUIT?
I THOUGHT
HE WAS GOING TO KILL PA.
LAST I HEARED,
HE WAS WORKING FOR
AN OIL COMPANY IN ALASKA.
DOES HE STILL WRITE?
OH...WELL,
HE WRITES NOW AND THEN.
ALL THREE OF US QUIT,
BUT YOU'RE
STILL HANGING ON,
AND YOU WON'T LET GO
OF HIM, WILL YOU?
I'LL GET YOU BREAKFAST.
I GOT TO GET
TO ATLANTA BY 1:00.
I'LL BRING THE KIDS
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.
IF YOU CAN.
YOU AIN'T SPENDING
THAT TIME ALONE.
OH, I AIN'T
NEVER ALONE.
I GOT THE LORD
LOOKING OUT FOR ME
ALL THE TIME.
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT,
DO YOU?
I GUESS
WE FAILED YOU THERE.
AND YOU GOT PA.
WELL!
I AIN'T PUTTING HIM
ON A LEVEL WITH GOD,
BUT I WOULDN'T BE
WITHOUT HIM.
SUSIE'S PRESENT.
THAT'S GREAT.
THANKS, MA.
HOW YOU GOING
TO MAKE OUT
WITH THEM TWO
YOUNG'UNS?
KIDS LIKE EATING OUT.
DON'T SOUND RIGHT.
WILL HE OR WON'T HE?
CAN HE OR CAN'T HE?
SHOULD YOU
OR SHOULDN'T YOU?
ROUND AND ROUND.
IT'S HIS LIFE.
YOU CAN'T
CHANGE A THING.
NO NEED TO WORRY IT
TO DEATH.
I ALWAYS WANTED
A FAMILY.
HEH! YOU GOT ONE.
I'M WEARY OF SEEING
MY CHILDREN
MARCH DOWN THAT HILL.
FIRST JED, THEN MILLIE.
NOW HIM.
YOU WRITE
EVERY WEEK, NOW.
YOU LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ME.
WHO'D FEED
THE CHICKENS?
DON'T FRET.
WE'LL MAKE OUT.
YOU GIVE THEM
MY LOVE.
GO ON, NOW.
HE'LL BE BACK.
NO. HE'S GOT
THE FAMILY NOW.
YOU GOT THIS PLACE.
PLACE OR FAMILY--
IS THAT THE CHOICE?
MAYBE WE WAS LUCKY.
NO CHOICES.
YOU MARRIED,
YOU STAYED MARRIED.
I'M STILL HERE.
NO, HECTOR.
YOU'RE UP
IN THE OLD ORCHARD.
IT WAS YOU
BRUNG ME DOWN.
YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT?
PLEASE, HECTOR.
THINGS CHANGE WHETHER
WE WANT THEM TO OR NOT.
FIVE YEARS!
SUSIE WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT
WHEN YOU DIED.
DILLARD'S CHANGED, TOO.
YOU NEVER SEEN THAT.
HE'S STUDYING
DIVORCE, AIN'T HE?
NOW WHAT'S THAT?
YOU TAKE THE TABLE,
I'LL TAKE THE CHAIR.
WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?
YOU TAKE AN ARM,
I'LL TAKE A LEG?
HE'S JUST
COON HUNTING AGAIN.
WHATEVER HE'S DOING,
THERE'S TWO YOUNG'UNS
TO BE CARED FOR.
THEY'RE GROWING
SOMEPLACE ELSE.
YOU AND ME
WAS PLANTED HERE.
"TO EVERYTHING,
THERE'S A SEASON.
"A TIME TO BE BORN,
A TIME TO DIE.
"A TIME TO PLANT,
A TIME TO PICK UP
THAT WHICH IS PLANTED."
I THOUGHT
YOU WAS NO HAND
AT QUOTING THE BIBLE.
GO AWAY, PLEASE, HECTOR.
I GOT TO FIGURE
THIS OUT MYSELF.
IT'S EASY FOR YOU NOW.
WELL...
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE DAYLIGHT
BETWEEN THE RIBS
TO CLEAR
A MAN'S MIND.
YOU AIN'T STILL HERE.
IT'S THE KIDS
THAT'S STILL HERE.
YOU WENT AWAY
FIVE YEARS AGO.
YOU GOT SO SICK...
YOU LEFT ME.
I WATCHED YOU GO.
I HEAR
YOU'RE JUST OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL.
ARE YOU FEELING
BETTER NOW?
WHO ARE YOU?
I TOLD YOU, HECTOR,
IT'S HOLLY BURRELL.
SHE'S WRITING ABOUT US
IN HER SCHOOL MAGAZINE.
ABOUT
THE OLD DAYS.
OH.
HOW DID YOU LIKE
BEING OVER THERE
IN HIGHLANDS?
I DIDN'T.
I JUST CAN'T STAND
THE TOWNS.
NO ROOM.
COULD YOU
SPEAK UP, SIR?
I SAID I DON'T
LIKE A TOWN!
THAT'S FINE.
YOU THINK YOU'LL
RETIRE NOW?
HOW'S THAT?
DO YOU STILL
WORK THE PLACE?
WELL, I--
PA DON'T
HEAR TOO GOOD
WHEN HE DON'T
WANT TO.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE SAID YOU OUGHT
TO TAKE IT EASY.
YOU'VE BEEN POORLY.
SO...I'VE BEEN POORLY.
WELL, I DON'T AIM
TO SLACK OFF NONE.
WHEN THE LORD
MADE A MAN,
HE MADE HIM GOOD!
HE MADE HIM TOUGH.
THIS OLD BODY'S
REALLY PUT TOGETHER.
YOU CAN'T HARDLY
TEAR IT APART,
IT'S SO WELL
PUT TOGETHER.
AND I'M GOING TO LIVE
AS LONG AS I SEE
ANYBODY ELSE LIVING!
THERE AIN'T NOBODY CAN
SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT.
WHAT YOU
KNITTING, MA?
SOCKS.
SOMETHING IN MY FINGERS
HELPS OCCUPY MY MIND.
WE GOT SOCKS HERE
TO DO A CENTIPEDE.
HOW MANY CHILDREN
HAVE YOU GOT,
MRS. NATIONS?
CALL ME AUNT ANNIE,
CHILD.
EVERYONE ELSE DOES.
I HAD FIVE.
LET'S SEE...
NO, I ASKED
YOU THAT.
OH, MY TEACHER
WANTED THIS ONE.
IS IT A PROBLEM
HERE,
KIDS GOING OFF
AND FAMILIES
SELLING OUT?
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WHEN YOU QUIT SCHOOL?
I'M GOING TO
BE A TEACHER.
I LIKE IT HERE.
DON'T YOU?
YEAH.
YOU STICK TO THAT.
IT'S WHERE YOU BELONG,
WHAT YOU VALUE.
I GUESS THIS PLACE
IS MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE WORLD,
ISN'T IT?
WHAT IS?
THIS PLACE.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
DIDN'T YOU SAY IT'S
WHAT YOU VALUE MOST?
NO.
WELL, WHAT IS?
SHE IS.
WHO?
HER!
OH.
WHAT DID I DO?
IT'S ALL RIGHT, PA.
IS THAT WHAT
MOST FOLKS TELL YOU?
MOST FOLKS SAY
THEY WON'T BUDGE,
BUT MY GRANNY
WANTS A TRAILER
WITH A TV.
TV.
WHEN DID YOU
EVER LOOK AT TV, PA?
OH, I SEEN IT.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
BIGGEST PIECE
OF SIN FURNITURE
MAN EVER MADE.
ALL SEX AND GUNS.
I'LL BET YOU
HALF THOSE FELLERS
NEVER HANDLED A GUN.
DID YOU?
GREW UP WITH THEM.
I WASN'T MORE THAN
ABOUT 5 YEARS OLD
WHEN MY DADDY PUT
A RIFLE IN MY HAND.
I DIDN'T MEAN
HUNTING, EXACTLY.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN?
DID YOU EVER
SHOOT ANYONE?
WELL, IF I DID,
I AIN'T GOING
TO TELL YOU ABOUT  IT.
YOU ALL RIGHT, MA?
FINE. I JUST NEEDED
ANOTHER BALL OF WOOL.
MY DADDY SAID
A REVENUER GOT SHOT
RIGHT OVER
IN THE NEXT HOLLOW.
TIME FOR MY PILL.
I'LL GET IT.
YOU SET!
I CAN DO IT.
I GUESS THERE AIN'T
NO PLACE IN THE WORLD
WHERE THERE
AIN'T SOME VIOLENCE.
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
SOMEBODY GOT HURT,
MRS. NA--
AUNT ANNIE?
YOU JUST DID YOUR BEST,
TRUSTING IN THE LORD.
I WAS RAISED ON THAT.
THE LORD IS WITH YOU
IN TIME OF TROUBLE
OR IN SICKNESS
OR IN PAIN.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS ASK.
HE CAN HEAL...EVERYTHING.
DIDN'T YOU EVER
GO TO A DOCTOR?
SUPPOSE
YOU BROKE A LEG
OR GOT
A TOOTHACHE?
IF YOUR LEG
BROKE BACK THEN,
THEY'D PLACE IT BACK
WITH SPLIT-WOOD PIECES,
AND THEN THEY'D TIE IT
WITH GOOD, STOUT STRING.
AND THEN THERE YOU'D SET
FOR ABOUT 12 MONTHS.
12 MONTHS?
IF YOU HAD TO HAVE
A TOOTH PULLED,
YOU'D SEE A FELLA
NAMED J...
GARRETT.
GARRETT.
AND HE'D SAY,
"LAY DOWN
ON THE FLOOR, BOY."
YOU'D STRETCH OUT.
HE'D PUT ONE KNEE
ON YOUR CHEST
AND CATCH YOU
ROUND YOUR HEAD.
HE WAS STOUT, TOO.
HE'D PUT ONE OF THOSE
HOMEMADE PULLERS IN THERE
AND GIVE HER A YANK.
AND HE'D BRING
THAT TOOTH,
IF HE DIDN'T BUST IT.
YOU WOULDN'T GO
TO MR. GARRETT
NOW, WOULD YOU?
YOU'D JUST LOVE TO HEAR
ME SAY, "YES, I WOULD.
"ALL THE OLD WAYS
WAS BETTER
THAN WHAT WE GOT NOW."
ONLY FOOLS
WOULD SAY THAT.
BUT SOME OF THE WAYS
WAS BETTER.
YOU HAD TIME.
NOWADAYS, IF YOU CAN'T
GET TO ATLANTA AND BACK
IN ONE DAY,
OOH...YOU'RE WAY BEHIND.
YOU HAD
NEIGHBORS THEN...
REAL NEIGHBORS.
YOU HAD THE LAND.
AND YOU HAD YOUR FAMILY.
THAT'LL DO US
TILL THEY SOUND THE BELL.
THE BELL?
ST. JOHN'S.
THEY DON'T DO IT NO MORE
UNLESS YOU ASK.
THEY'D RING IT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
TOLL IT.
YOU'D COUNT
IF YOU HEARD THE BELLS,
FIGURE OUT
WHO IT COULD BE.
IF IT WAS
A 2-YEAR-OLD, ONLY TWO.
OR 10 OR 20
OR WHATEVER.
FOR THE OLD ONES,
IT TOLLED
FOR HALF AN HOUR.
IT WAS SLOW,
YOU SEE.
DONG!
DONG!
SOUNDS SAD.
NOTHING SAD ABOUT IT.
SAINT PAUL SAID,
"BE NOT SORRY FOR
THOSE WHO ARE DEPARTED."
FOLKS WOULD COME HELP
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.
HELP YOU DIG THE GRAVE
AND MAKE THE COFFIN.
YOU'D HAVE A DRINK...
AND TALK.
YOU'D SING A LITTLE.
I LIKED THE SONGS
THAT WAS HOPEFUL.
THERE WAS ONE
DILLARD USED TO SING.
I CAN HEAR IT
IN MY HEAD,
BUT THE WORDS
AIN'T CLEAR.
MY VOICE AIN'T MUCH,
NEITHER.
%% NOW THE STARS
IS RESTIN' %%
%% SETTIN' ON THE HILL %%
%% NOTHIN' IS A-SOUNDIN' %%
%% BUT A WHIPPOORWILL %%
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
%% DOWN IN OUR HOLLOW %%

[BELL TOLLS]
THIS IS SOMETHING
I NEVER DID LEARN.
WHEN DID PA
EVER WEAR A TIE?
AT OUR WEDDING
AND WHEN HIS PA DIED.
THIS SAME ONE.
YOU WANT
I SHOULD TIE IT?
NO. THANK YOU, DILLARD,
BUT I KIND OF LIKE
TO DO FOR HIM MYSELF.
I HATE TO PUT THE COINS
ON HIS EYES, THOUGH.
SEEMS LIKE THE VERY
LAST THING I CAN DO.
I HAD TWO QUARTERS HERE,
BUT ONE'S SLIPPED AWAY.
MA, WHEN ARE
YOU GOING TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?
OH...
I'LL FIDDLE WITH SOMETHING
LATER ON WITH THE OTHERS.
WHERE THEY ALL GONE?
GRADY'S
DOING THE MILKING.
TOLD ME I WEREN'T
NO HAND AT IT.
JUST LIKE PA.
NOW, DILLARD...
NOW THAT
WAS NOTHING, MA.
HIM AND ME WAS
OVER THAT LONG AGO.
GUDGER WENT
TO GET LUMBER
FOR THE BOX,
AND I SHOOED
MILLIE'S KIDS
DOWN TO THE CREEK.
BUT IT'S SO QUIET
ALL OF A SUDDEN. LISTEN.
I'M JUST
HOLDING MY BREATH.
IT'S THE BELL, MA.
IT'S QUIT.
WHY, SO IT HAS.
77.
AND IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.
SO STILL,
IT MAKES ME TIRED.
SIT DOWN, THEN.
YOU KNOW, DILLARD,
HE WAS BRAGGING
TO THE DOCTOR
ON YOUR MEDAL.
PA WAS?
DON'T THAT BEAT ALL?
IT WAS
ONLY SECOND PLACE.
BUT WITH GUITAR PLAYERS
FROM ALL OVER GEORGIA.
NO, DILLARD, DON'T.
DON'T YOU
COMFORT ME NONE.
HE DIDN'T LIKE TEARS.
HE'D DO ANYTHING FOR ME
IF I CRIED,
SO I NEVER DID.
NOT EVEN WHEN
YOUR SISTER MARY DIED.
HE DID, THOUGH.
I CAUGHT HIM RIGHT OUT
THERE BY THE SHED,
HIS FACE ALL WET.
HE WAS MEAN TO ME
ALL DAY LONG AFTER THAT.
AND THEN THAT EVENING,
HE COMES IN WITH
A BUNCH OF DEWBERRIES.
HE JUST SHOVED THEM
AT ME ACROSS THE TABLE.
TURNED HIS BACK,
CHANGED HIS SHIRT,
SAT DOWN TO SUPPER.
NEVER SAID A WORD.
[DOG BARKS]
THEY MUST BE BACK.
I KNOW I HAD
TWO OF THEM.
YOU GOT A QUARTER?
YOU KNOW
WHAT TROUBLES ME?
WHEN I WASHED HIM
JUST NOW,
I FOUND
A BIG WHITE SCAR
ABOVE HIS KNEE,
HIS RIGHT KNEE.
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT MADE THAT.
NOT FOR THE LIFE
OF ME, I CAN'T.
AND I DON'T WANT
TO FORGET NOTHING.
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
HURT BAD.
THIS OLD BODY'S REALLY
PUT TOGETHER, BUDDY.
CAN'T HARDLY
TEAR IT APART.
I'LL BE RIGHT NEAR
IF YOU NEED ME.
HECTOR,
YOU REMEMBER
WHEN MARY DIED,
YOU DID IT FOR HER
'CAUSE I WASN'T
UP TO IT.
WELL...
I'M DOING IT NOW.
"DILLARD NATIONS...
"SECOND. GUITAR...
1968."
HECTOR.
IT'S HIS MEDAL.
YOU HEAR ME NOW?
IT'S HIS MEDAL.
OH, LORD,
I NEVER COULD
STAND GOODBYES.
THERE.
THAT'S DONE.
IT'S HIS MEDAL, HECTOR...
BUT IT'S MY HAND.
%% EVERY SHADOW SHRINKIN' %%
%% SHRINKIN' TO THE WEST %%
%% BREEZE COMES SO SWEETLY %%
%% ACROSS FRESH-MOWED HAY %%
%% DEAR LORD, BE WITH US %%
%% THROUGH THE NEWBORN DAY %%
%% THE NEWBORN DAY %%
%% DEAR LORD %%
%% OH, LET IT STAY %%
%% OH, HEAR US PRAY %%
%% DEAR LORD %%%%
YOU TAKING THOSE
WITH YOU?
THEY MADE THEM
FOR ME.
I AIN'T ABOUT TO
LEAVE THEM BEHIND.
YOU SURE
MY ROCKER'S COMING?
MA, YOU CAN'T TAKE
EVERYTHING ON THAT PLANE.
THEY'LL GET EVERYTHING
ON TUESDAY.
ROCKER'S
TOP OF THE LIST.
HOW HIGH UP
DO THEM PLANES GO?
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
OF COURSE YOU WILL.
SO...
YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND.
OLD WOMAN.
OLD WOMAN,
I'M TALKING TO YOU.
YOU DON'T HEAR ME,
DO YOU?
BETTER GET
STARTED, MA.
I'M ALL READY.
YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN ANYTHING?
OH, THE GLASSES.
ALL SET?
GUESS SO.
MOON WILL
BE UP TONIGHT.
ALMOST FULL.
ALL VINE
AND NO TATER.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
GOING TO BE SOME
FINE HOMES UP HERE.
ALWAYS WAS.
ABSOLUTELY.
NO OFFENSE.
YOU FIND THEM, MA?
ANYTHING ELSE
I FORGOT,
I CAN DO WITHOUT.
WE CAN COME BACK.
OH, I'M COMING BACK.
HE'S GOT THAT
IN THE PAPER?
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.
PRIVATE
BURIAL GROUND'S
PROTECTED BY LAW.
WE CAN'T TOUCH IT.
YOU GOT A HAMMER
SOMEWHERE,
AUNT ANNIE?
UNDER THE BED.
PUT IT BACK.
NOPE.
YOU TAKING
YOUR PA'S TOOLS?
I DON'T AIM
TO BE A CARPENTER,
BUT IT'S HIM TAUGHT
ME TO USE THEM.
I FIGURED I'D LIKE
TO BE REMINDED.
YOU'D BEST
LEND ME YOUR ARM
DOWN THE HILL.
WANT TO LOOK AROUND?
HONEY, THERE AIN'T
A ROCK OR A TREE HERE
I DON'T KNOW BETTER
THAN MY OWN HAND,
SO LET'S
JUST GET ALONG.
I DON'T HAVE TO WAVE.
"SOLD."
"TRESPASSERS
WILL BE PROSECUTED."
TRESPASSERS.
I GUESS THAT'S ME.
THEY GOT A BIG JOB
OF DIGGING TO DO
TO GET RID OF ME.
SHE'LL BE BACK.
