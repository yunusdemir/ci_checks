Miss Lemmon! Miss Lemmon!
Miss Lemmon!
What?
Doctor Warfield!
Miss Lemmon, get Professor
Kelp in here immediately.
But, Dr Warfield, I think Professor
Kelp has a class right now.
He had a class. Can't you hear?
Now, get him!
Fire's up here.
Get the axe! Get the axe!
All right, men, all
together at the door.
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Oh, oh... I beg your pardon.
Oh, but this is terrible!
Oh...!
Oh... Oh...
Oh, my...!
Professor Kelp?
Are you all right? And if you
are, where are you all right?
Oh, my...
Dr Warfield wants to
see you in his office.
- Dr Warfield?
- Yes, right away.
I used too much...
Kelp.
How long have you been on the
faculty of this university?
Well, now, I would say, er...
prior to my exposure as a student
counsellor, USC, three years...
No, I went to post-grad,
naturally, two years... No...
I had a botany exposure in
one particular school...
I had decided, pre-med, botany, whatever,
I would prefer the sciences...
I think I should go back
to when I graduated...
How long?!
Two years and 22 minutes now.
Kelp, as I recall, upon
your arrival here,
I told you and the other
new faculty members,
I will not stand for any member of staff
utilising the university's facilities
for his or her own
personal experiments.
Did I not make myself
perfectly clear?
Good, I knew my memory
served me well.
And Kelp, wasn't it
approximately six weeks later
that you conducted a rather interesting
experiment before your class?
Let me see... I think it had something
to do with an additive to gasolene
for the purpose of increasing the
efficiency of the combustion engine.
- Right?
- Yes, it was something to that effect...
Do you recall what
that additive was?
Yes, as a matter of fact, now that
you bring it up, the additive was
3 parts carbon, 5 parts hydrogen,
1 part nitrogen, 3 parts oxygen.
- Which, of course, is?
- Nitroglycerine.
- The results were?
- Negative.
- And?
- Noisy.
Noisy!
It was the worst explosion in the history
of this or any other university.
That was two years ago and they're
still talking about it today.
Now you mention it, I saw
young Phips the other day.
You recall Arnold Phips
was in my class that day?
Yes, really, what
did he have to say?
He's feeling much better and the
bandages should be off in two weeks.
Oh, well, a couple... Exactly!
That's exactly what I mean!
You are a menace.
Professor Kelp, believe me, I
know what I'm talking about.
Kelp, it's human nature.
Kelp, people just don't like
teachers blowing up their kids.
Kelp, try to understand
that I understand
that scientists and creators have
their little eccentricities.
Einstein hated haircuts, da Vinci
loved to paint and Newton...
Didn't he have something
to do with figs?
So therefore I, too, realise that you
have many of the same eccentricities.
Leave them in the locker when you
come in in the morning, Professor.
And feel free to take
them home at night.
All right, Kelp,
simmer down and relax.
I'm sure we won't have to have another
talk like this again. Am I correct?
Oh, without question,
you're absolutely...
yes, we'll never have
to correct our talk.
We won't ever speak...
That is, we'll never have to talk again.
We just never will discuss talking.
Er, we shouldn't really
converse about speaking.
Professor, our discussion
has come to an end.
- Thank you, Dr...
- Kelp.
Yes?
Your watch...
does it...
always?
Oh, no, just when I open...
Those are your greens.
Hi, how are you?
"Therefore, through history,
"man has been curious..."
- Professor Kelp.
- Yes, Worfshefski?
- I have to go...
- You have to go?
Since when did you find it
necessary to ask permission to go?
No, well, what I meant to say,
Professor Kelp, was that...
I have to go to football practice.
Football practice?
At this hour?
What about your studies?
Well, Mr Coughman, the coach,
he asked me to try and get off
my first class this morning...
Get off your first class?
Did he, now? To get
off your first class?
Mr Worfshefski, had you learned
anything in your first class,
and I refer to the
elementary class,
you might not be in such
dire need of learning now.
Your request is denied.
Please sit down.
I don't want to hear another
word about your stupid practice.
You don't have no call to go yelling
at me like that, Professor Kelp.
Worfshefski, I might
have been a little rash.
That wasn't very nice
calling my practice stupid.
I meant I was stupid in
assuming practice was stupid.
Naughty, naughty, naughty.
- Teacher!
- Well, you shouldn't be upset.
W... W... Worfshefski,
you're breaking my...
There goes the tibia. Worfshefski,
you're... Worfshefski!
You must realise that...
You don't realise what
you're doing, Worfshefski.
Worfshefski, you don't
realise what you're doing.
Well, just don't do
something, sit there!
Er, that is... class dismissed!
You may go.
Can I be of any assistance,
Professor Kelp?
Oh, er...
Thank you, Miss Purdy, you're
very, very considerate.
Actually, I would
appreciate the assistance
for were it not for you assisting me
I might very well be here all semester.
Well, er, let's start
with the book.
Yeah... I don't know, I...
You have to... The, er...
Wait, it's connected, you
better not press that.
Just pull it out, Miss Purdy.
Oh, that really snapped.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- Try leaning.
- Oh, no, no, no, no...
Let me just... Let
me have this arm...
Just may I have that arm? All right,
you just hold some of the body...
Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you, Miss Purdy.
- Are you all right, Professor?
Oh, yes, this is very
embarrassing, Miss Purdy.
Why don't you call me
Stella, Professor?
I thought it was Stella Purdy.
Oh, you mean to call you Stella?
How stupid of me. Sorry.
I will, stupid... Er, Stella.
I'm very upset. It's
very embarrassing.
Honestly, Professor, you shouldn't
let a big ox like that bother you.
He's the typical bully that
loves picking on a small man.
Yes, yes, you're right, Miss Purdy,
but you'd best run along or
you'll miss your next class.
You're all right?
Oh, yes, as I said, I'm just
embarrassed. I'm fine, thank you.
Er, Miss Purdy...
Miss Pur... Excuse me.
The, er...
He's a typical bully that loves
picking on a small man...
picking on a small man...
picking on a small man...
I think I broke myself.
Wrong way, sir. This is the gym.
I take it you're new?
- Well, I'm not brand new.
- No, I mean a new student.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Are you hurt?
Well, actually, if you would
say that a man with an ulcer,
a nail in his shoe and a splinter in his
finger was then struck by lightning...
If you could say he wasn't
hurt then I'm not hurt.
Good. By the way, we don't
wear glasses at Vic Tanny's.
Fine, I'll just take these off.
I didn't realise that you're
not supposed to, er...
There's nowhere really that I...
Is there some place I could put?
- Shall I put these in a locker?
- I'd appreciate it. You're very kind.
I would've put them there had I
known that there was a restriction.
Some people use them for a
fa√ßade, I wear them for eyes.
You see, "for eyes",
it's a play on "eyes".
I hope I did nothing wrong by
wearing them. I didn't realise.
If we could get started. I do have
a class and need to get going.
- Come with me.
- Wonderful.
I've never done this before.
I don't know where to begin.
We start right here.
Identical twins.
- No, that's a pulling machine.
- A pulling machine? What does it do?
- You pull it! 15 or 20 pulls to begin with.
- Oh, I see.
- And take it easy.
- Naturally.
I wouldn't strain myself for the
world. Thank you very much.
You're welcome. Er, happy muscles.
Yes, I certainly do.
Oh, yes, I've seen that
in those magazines.
Oh, that's invigorating.
Oh, that's terrific.
I'm going to have a great deal
of fun with this, I can tell.
"the various aspects, of
course, is relativity to hydrogen.
"There is hydrogen, duly explosive and
more devastating than the atomic.
"There is equally the devastation
in nitrogen... nitrogen, equally..."
I couldn't help but notice -
I was standing here -
that's amazing, the way you
push those things up there.
It must take a great
deal of patience.
And a little muscle.
Oh, yes. Well, you certainly are...
Yes, you are...
I'd love to be able to... I would
really enjoy trying that some time.
I don't think you'd have
the patience for it.
I have the other thing you
mentioned: A little muscle.
I say, that was, er,
sort of a corker!
Here, enjoy yourself.
I, er... I suspect it was
somewhat heavier than I...
- uncanny.
- I agree, Doctor.
But there are a couple of points
that I neglected to mention.
Specifically, the day I went to
Vic Tanny, I got on the scale,
as they normally do,
to check you in,
and I weighed 153 pounds,
and then after six months,
I weighed myself on that very same
scale, and I found that I weighed 151.
Very interesting, Professor Kelp.
But I am surprised that a man with
your education and background
should be intimidated by
a bully to this extent.
Plus, you must know, only some men
react to bodybuilding exercise,
whereas others just don't.
Professor, revenge can't be
that important to you.
I must take objection
there, Doctor.
Revenge might have been
the motivating force,
but I feel that curiosity has
taken over where revenge began.
I am more or less being compelled by
completing something that I started.
I must finish what I start,
finish what I start.
I admire a man who likes
to see something through,
but your six months have failed.
- What will you do now?
- I actually don't know, Doctor.
That's why I wanted to see you.
I had one plan and I thought
I'd mention it to you.
Chemistry is probably what I know
best, that's all I know, really.
Some of the world's finest
pharmaceutical companies
make bodybuilding minerals, vitamins,
chemicals all based on chemistry,
so I'd approach it from
a chemistry standpoint.
To prove a point, I'll show you...
Oh, Professor, excuse me,
I seem to have run out of time.
I'm due at the hospital.
I'm terribly sorry, I never realised
the time. In fact, I have a class...
Go ahead, but I'd like to browse
around if it's all right.
Not at all.
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- You're terribly kind. Thank you.
Let's see, anatomy, body structure,
structure of body muscle...
"Man's growth,
physically and mentally.
"A man's mind, from childhood to
old age, never stops growing.
"Not in size or by measure, but by
constant learning and knowledge.
"On the other hand, man's
body stops at a point,
"that of completion of the anatomy,
"yet we have learned, through
chemistry... " Ha, ha, ha!
"man can grow further with
the aid of additional elements."
Seven weeks and 13 experiments have
gone by with little or no strides made,
but today I'm certain
my formula will work,
so certain that I plan
trying it on myself tonight.
Tonight.
Oh, I'm really...
Oh, Miss Purdy, I'm terribly sorry.
Just let me get you up there, dear.
That's just ridiculous. I never...
I just swung the door...
It's all right. You just
knocked the breath out of me.
- So stupid of me.
- I'm perfectly all right. No harm done.
- That's fine.
- Did anyone invite you for tonight?
Invite me? I don't
think so... Where?
The class is having a mid-term party at the
Purple Pit. We'd love you to join us.
Thank you, it's terribly considerate
and kind of you, and I appreciate it,
and I've always said there should
be a closer interrelationship
between the student and the
faculty based on better learning,
yet the Purple Pit is off limits
to the faculty of the university.
Didn't you know?
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry, Professor.
I guess it slipped my mind,
but the Pit's never been what it's
supposed to be, by reputation anyway.
You know, I, too, have heard
it's a wild, terrible place,
when it's really just a quaint spot
where the students can talk and relax
and just generally get acquainted.
And when you really get
down to it, it's quite dull.
- broads.
- They'll be glad. You gotta do it.
Why not?
Stella, couldn't you
talk Kelp into coming?
Can you imagine the professor here?
He'd break into a rash.
Don't be too sure. Professor Kelp's just
the kind of guy who might fool you.
I bet he likes to get out
on his own a little.
I'll bet you right now he's probably
on his way to a secret rendezvous
with a mysterious,
dark-haired female.
Come in, Julius.
Er, how are you tonight, Jennifer?
- How are you, Julius?
- I'm fine.
I am, too-lius.
Now, be very quiet, Jennifer.
We have a lot of work to do.
- Tonight's the big night.
- Keep very quiet.
He's got a lot of work to do.
Tonight's the big night. The big night.
Well, we're just about
ready, Jennifer.
You might be ready, Julius, but if
I were you, I'd think about it.
Think, think, you'd better think.
Better think about it.
I told you, Julius.
I told you, Julius.
I told you, Julius. I told you...
Thank you very much, sir.
We know you'll be very happy.
And you look just stunning.
And we'll have your other suits and
things no later than next week.
- What'll it be?
- Ah, that's no way to talk! Tsk-tsk!
"What'll it be?" That's no
way to treat a customer.
Come here. Pay attention.
You'll feel better and
customers'll be happier.
Try this: "What'll it
be, hmm?" Try that.
Come on, we haven't
got all night. Try it.
What'll it be... mmm?
Good, that was wonderful. Did anyone
ever tell you you couldn't sing?
Nice. Make me an Alaskan Polar Bear
Heater on the double. Come on.
Say, why don't you pick on
somebody your own disposition?
Oh, please, Mr Bar-room Brawler,
don't hurt me or anything like that.
- Did you say Polar Bear Heater?
- No, you did.
- I said an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater.
- I never heard of that.
Until now. All right,
pay attention.
- Two shots of vodka.
- Two shots of vodka.
- A little rum.
- A little rum.
- Some bitters.
- Bitters.
- And a smidgin of vinegar.
- And a smidgin of...
You gonna drink this or
rub it on your chest?
That was terrific! Did you hear that,
folks? A regular George Bernard Shaw.
Good boy! And he did it all by himself.
You did it all by yourself without help.
That's terrific. And
with your own big mouth.
If you don't want the cocktail shaker in
your gums, shut up and pay attention.
- Is that clear? Repeat after me: I'll...
- I'll...
- I'll pay attention.
- I'll pay attention.
All right, let's continue.
- A shot of vermouth.
- A shot of vermouth.
- A shot of gin.
- A little gin.
- A little brandy.
- A little brandy.
- Lemon peel.
- Lemon peel.
- Orange peel.
- Orange peel.
Cherry.
- Some more Scotch.
- More Scotch.
Now, mix it nice, then
pour it into a tall glass.
I never tried this.
Mind if I take a sip?
Go right ahead.
Not bad.
Hi.
I don't know any better place
to get to know a lovely lady
than on the dance floor.
- I hope you don't refuse.
- I'm sorry, I'm with...
- Move along, sonny. She's with us.
- Sh! Sit down.
Come here, honey. Stand up a minute.
Just there. I'll be right back.
We don't want trouble,
do we? Sit like nice boys.
Would you like me to tell Dr Warfield,
my personal friend, of your bad manners?
He would be very
displeased. So cool it.
If you're nice lads, cute little chappies,
later on I'll let you twirl my key-chain.
Now, relax.
It's all straight, baby.
Put your arm up there.
Remember how they do that in the
movies? They walk like high class.
Dancing, nice. We're hugging.
It's wonderful.
Clear the floor.
I know what you're thinking.
Where's he been all my life, right?
No, not exactly.
And that you're happy the way I
handled those three goons, right?
Well, normally, I would
have belted them.
But I didn't want
to muss myself up,
and have you dance with
a sloppy guy. Dig?
Then, you restrained yourself,
just for little old me.
I knew you'd appreciate it.
I do a lot of nice things.
Is that really the case or is this
line 27 a for young college girls?
Aw, now, you see?
You went and done it.
One of the rare times in my life
when I dig down into the soul,
and you doubt my veracity?
Well, that hurts.
Well, it's not your
veracity that I doubt.
- The music's stopped.
- Yeah, I heard.
Hold it a second. Hold... Hold it.
We'll make our own music,
gorgeous. Just hold it.
You and you stay. Tubby, go
rest your thumbs. I'll drive.
- Sweetie, go get your lips pressed.
- Split. - Listen...
You listen. Sit down. You'll be
thrilled. Believe you me.
Sit and listen and watch.
Mood is wrong!
Innkeeper, got sexy lights?
Lay it on me.
Better. Better. Now, watch, baby.
Every move a picture.
<i>‚ô™ That old black magic
has me in its spell</i>
<i>‚ô™ That old black magic
that you weave so well</i>
<i>‚ô™ Those icy fingers
up and down my spine</i>
<i>‚ô™ The same old witchcraft
when your eyes meet mine</i>
<i>‚ô™ The same old tingle
that I feel inside</i>
<i>‚ô™ And then that elevator
starts its ride</i>
<i>‚ô™ And down, down, down I go</i>
<i>‚ô™ Round, round, round I go</i>
<i>‚ô™ Like a leaf that's
caught in the tide</i>
<i>‚ô™ I should stay away</i>

fate had me created for</i>

<i>‚ô™ Love ‚ô™</i>
Back. Back! Thank you, kiddies. You're
all very nice little boys and girls.
If you're real nice, tomorrow night I might
ration out a little more of this rare talent.
Now, back to your seats,
back. Go on, go on.
Back, back, back.
They're nice kids, all nice.
All nice kids.
They have very good
taste, I might add.
I'm glad. It would be a shame to waste
the genius of yours on the riff-raff.
Honey, I always say, if
you're good and you know it,
why waste time beating
around the bush, true?
And I always say that to love yourself
is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
and after watching you, I know you
and you will be very happy together.
Just a minute, sweetheart.
I don't recall dismissing you.
You rude, discourteous egomaniac.
You're crazy about me, right?
This morning, looking
in the mirror,
I enjoyed what I saw so much,
I couldn't tear myself away.
Have some, baby?
If I were your baby,
I'd be swinging from a tree.
- Aw, Stella, that's not nice.
- How do you know my name?
Well, we were introduced.
No, we weren't introduced, or I would
have remembered your name.
Tell me how you knew.
You've heard of ESP, extrasensory
perception. I'm a firm believer in ESP...
Hey, buddy, you really
sang up a storm.
Yeah, I know. Thanks a lot.
Well, you heard him.
Everybody knows Buddy.
- Buddy?
- Yeah.
Well, is that it? Or do you find it
difficult remembering two of them?
Hey, you're kooky. That was cute.
"Do you find it difficult
remembering two of them?"
Wonderful! I knew you'd
be a barrel of laughs.
No, I don't find it
difficult remembering two.
<i>- ‚ô™ Love, love, love... ‚ô™</i>
- Buddy...
Love. That's it. Buddy Love.
Buddy Love?
Of the Los Angeles Loves.
But that's of no consequence.
- Shall we make a move?
- Where?
- Do you have a car?
- Of course.
- Crazy. Let's split.
- Let's split what?
- Is it new?
- Not brand new.
- I've driven it a whole week.
- Nutty! Let's go.
Here, baby. Wipe the lipstick off,
slide over here and let's get started.
We have started and finished. And for an
encore, get an earful of the following.
I'll admit you're a
very sharp-looking guy.
And you certainly have that
proverbial gift of the gab.
I've only gone this far
because when you meet someone like
you, your curiosity gets stirred up.
Well, mister, this is one kitten that
won't be smitten by that little old devil.
So turn this car around and take me
right back where you picked me up.
That is, where we met.
I said wipe the lipstick off.
Was it something I said?
You must be deranged.
If you don't believe in idle chatter and
a lot of small talk, yeah, I'm deranged.
You'd prefer I conduct myself like
the little boys you usually date?
Nothing delights us more
than being enjoyed,
appreciated or just plain
liked by someone, right?
You're not going to tell me
that you're here with me now
because I don't appeal to you.
And I'm sure that you can see I
dig you pretty good, too, right?
Well, isn't it easier to say so?
Would you prefer I used
that phoney dialogue
I'm sure you've heard at least
a half a dozen times before?
So you see, Stell,
when I tell you that you're a
vibrant, beautiful, exciting woman,
you can believe me, you
can bet it's the truth.
Because I'd have to be a complete idiot
not to want to hold you and kiss you,
and make our time together
a warm, wonderful moment
that could grow and develop
into many moments, many hours,
and into something
really important.
Nobody ever said anything
like that to me before.
Nor can I ever remember a more honest
approach to two people being together.
That's what I want
you to understand.
Actually, I've never had, er...
er, that is, er...
er, what I mean is, er...
Miss Purdy...
Hello, Miss Purdy!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Professor.
That's perfectly all right, Miss
Purdy, I hope I didn't wake you.
I don't recall excluding you from the other
class members from taking this test.
I'm terribly sorry, Professor,
I was just getting ready to start.
Oh, just getting ready to start.
Splendid, splendid. Just getting ready.
Students, please be aware that the test
papers must go on my desk for marking,
also please be equally aware
of tomorrow's problem:
H20 plus NO2 as we did the
other day, if you recall.
I'm awfully sorry, and if
it would be agreeable,
I'd like to stay after my
last class and take the test.
Well, that's highly irregular, Miss
Purdy, but, er... we... we're...
Are you all right, Miss Purdy?
I'll know better tonight. I mean,
yes, sir, I'm quite all right.
Oh, fine, then I'll
see you tonight...
That is, after your last class,
as you said, to take the test.
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll hold your paper.
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.
Be certain that it's
after your last class.
I'll be marking these
papers accordingly.
Professor.
Ye... Ye... Oh, yes, Gibson?
- I've got that book you asked for.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, wonderful.
Oh...
Now, then...
As you might very well recall,
yesterday in "Discussing Biology":
"The long legs of the beetle and
the wonderful body of the ant."
No, what I meant to say was:
"The beautiful hair
of the blonde fish."
No, actually...
Er, no... "The legs..."
"terrific looking..."
I am completely aware of what
chemistry and drugs can do
to assist and aid
the body and mind.
Yet I don't really believe what happened
to me comes strictly from chemistry.
There must be an explanation
for this phenomenon.
- Jennifer...
- Hi, sweetie.
I knew I was on the right track, but I
never figured on anything like this.
I must have hit on heredity. Yep.
That's it. Heredity. Let's see...
Elmer...
Elmer!
If you're not in here in 10 seconds, your
dinner will go to your family: The hogs!
Elm...!
Don't you sneak up on me.
I was just finishing the ironing of
your underthings, Edwina, darling.
Love... Angel...
And all the other nice things I wish I
could think of, so you won't hit...
or yell...
- Honey...
- Honey?!
Don't you "honey" me, you...
you artificial son of a lizard.
Now, sit down, and for
the third time today,
make a slob of yourself
trying to find your mouth.
Idiot!
- Can't you eat with your mouth closed?
- Not until I get something in it, dearest.
What was that?
Nothing, nothing.
It's quite all right.
You're right. You're always right.
My poor Dada.
My poor Dada.
Well, Jennifer, if that's
what's to be then I'll be it.
You know what they say,
Julie-baby: Que sera, sera.
Oh, Jennifer, you know
what I'm thinking?
If this formula were to
fall into the wrong hands,
the consequences could
be devastating.
Now, it's much too
complicated to memorise
and far too vitally
important to destroy.
The only two people that I know
I can trust are my mother...
and my father.
What I should do...
is mail my formula, a copy,
to Mother and Father
with instructions that were
anything to happen to me,
they are to send a copy of the formula
and my original copy to Washington.
George or Martha?
No, Washington D...
You're a silly bird
with a big mouth.
- Professor Kelp...
- Yes?
- I'm ready, Professor.
- That's very... Yeah... What?
Did you forget about my test?
No... er...
Actually, no... I... I'm terribly
sorry... I did... I have it here...
Why don't you sit down at your
table and I'll get your paper.
I actually didn't, er,
really forget. I, er...
I have so many members of the...
class, it's difficult to...
Oh, yes, here we are.
It's very difficult to...
You do want me to take the test?
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Purdy.
Certainly, of course, it's
necessary for you to take it.
- Miss Purdy...
- Yes, Professor?
I was going to say, I sincerely hope
that you don't mind if I don't linger.
I have some very essential matters
that I must take care of.
Certainly, Professor Kelp. And
thank you for understanding.
I understand far better than you
would ever believe, honey...
Er, Miss Purdy, that is.
You just go right on
and thank you for...
Julius! In the afternoon?
Hiya, chicky-baby.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
Crazy. I thought I'd visit your little
land of learning. Cute. Cute pad.
What happened to you last night?
What d'you run away like that for?
I thought you saw a
ghost or something.
Oh, yeah. How about that?
That's why I stopped by.
I thought I'd lay it on you,
but this ain't the place to talk.
What do you say we meet later at the
Purple Pit? We could talk better there.
I don't know. You're pretty weird.
And I don't want...
- Sh, sh. 10 o'clock?
- Perfect.
Figures.
Hey, honey, you look
a little drawn.
Did you find it a little difficult going
all this time without seeing me? Sh, sh.
Don't fight it.
I don't want to hang you up, honey.
I see you're doing your little test here.
But don't worry, beautiful.
Science'll do fine without you.
But man needs you the most.
This man. Come here.
That's good for you. If you
want more, call for refills.
Later.
Write nice.
I just told you the time.
It's still 11.15.
- Yeah, I know.
- OK, kids.
You can all relax.
Watch where you're going, Mac.
Now that your desperate attempt
at having a good time's flunked,
have no fear, Buddy's here.
Let the good times roll.
Hiya, baby.
There's my date.
That sharp-looking chick's my date.
Cheer up, baby, your prize
package has arrived.
- Hello, stale ones.
- You're pretty late, Mr Love.
Hold it, baby, you got it a little mixed up.
You're just way too early, that's all.
Be a nice girl and plant one
over there. You'll feel better.
Come on, the best things
in life are free.
And you'll admit, you've got one
of the best things. Lay it on me.
You're impossible.
Yeah, well, have some
impossible. Come on.
See, wasn't that worth waiting for?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-UH!
You gotta admit, I'm not one of
the run-of-the-mill-type creeps
that hang around this joint, right?
You got a good thing,
don't louse it up.
Isn't it enough that you've got
the swingingest and the best?
You want me to be on time, too?
- OK, OK, you win.
- Naturally.
Please tell me why you ran away last
night and left me just sitting there?
Hey, hey, don't get all riled up.
Cool it! Cool it!
I don't want to get into no discussions
on an empty stomach anyhow. This is flat.
Vampira, bring your kit.
You rang?
You don't sound exactly too
thrilled to serve the leader.
On the contrary, I find it a rare
privilege to serve His Royal Lowest.
You're cute, like a black widow spider.
Shut your mouth and just take the order.
I've decided I shall not continue
the flight with the fuel I got.
So give me a boilermaker,
and heavy on the boil.
Go on, go on, go on. Come on,
I haven't got all night.
She's crazy about me also.
Now, Lost Weekend Junior,
you've ordered your drink.
About last night. Would you
like to explain what happened?
I told you I was going
to tell you. It's...
Why don't we table
it a while, sweetie?
I mean, all the kids, they're kind
of waiting. It's Dullsville out.
I'll be back. You take five. And I
love you, baby. Mean it sincerely.
You wait for me, huh?
Oh, there you are, sweets.
Thanks a lot.
Sickening, isn't he?
But... he's got something.
And I mean to find out what it is.
I think I'll do...
do a tune that I'm going to
record for Poverty Records.
They're the only
ones who'll have me.
<i>‚ô™ I'm in the mood for love</i>
<i>‚ô™ Simply... Simp...</i>
<i>‚ô™ Simply because...</i>
<i>‚ô™ you're near me</i>
<i>‚ô™ Fun... Fun... Fun...</i>
<i>‚ô™ F... Funny but
when you're near me</i>
<i>‚ô™ I... I'm...</i>
<i>‚ô™ I'm in the mood for love... ‚ô™</i>
That's...
I think that'll be it
for a while, kids.
Later, Stella. Wait...
I feel like the girl
on her wedding night
whose absent-minded husband goes
home to his mother for dinner.
Where is he?
- What time is it?
- I think he's getting his watch fixed.
- Think he had an accident?
- Where is he?
- Ten to one he doesn't show.
- Hope nothing's wrong.
The... Ow!
<i>‚ô™ Round and round and round I go</i>
<i>‚ô™ In a spin</i>
<i>‚ô™ Loving the spin that I am in</i>

No, I didn't mean... Yes...
Actually, it kinda swings and...
The formula needs to be
stronger to ensure more time.
Stronger... ensure more time.
Tired.
Tired.
Yes, Dr Warfield would
appreciate it very much.
Can I go right in?
The faculty is always ready to
serve the needs of the students.
- I'm terribly sorry I'm late, Dr Warfield.
- Any time, Miss Purdy, any time at all.
Thank you.
Therefore, the success
or failure of the prom
rests on your shoulders as members
of the Entertainment Committee.
Miss Lemmon, will you send in the
proposed list of the entertainments.
Good, good, "The Lightlighters".
Wonderful... Love folk singers.
<i>‚ô™ The blue-nosed beetle likes
to needle all the people... ‚ô™</i>
Who is this "Wickern and Wett"?
The comedy team?
Good, good, perfect.
I thought they'd split up.
Who's this "Buddy Love"?
What's a Buddy Love?
He's a local boy.
He's just terrific.
- He's our new leader.
- Leader?
- He's, like, too much.
- Like too much what?
He's one of the truly great
swingers of all time.
Swingers... Swingers of all time...
It seems that you students
know Mr Love quite well.
What about the faculty members?
Anyone here familiar with Mr Love?
- Oh, he's the greatest.
- Do you know Mr Love?
Oh... Me?
No... I meant... Well, I heard
all the other students...
- Professor Kelp, I heard that myself.
- Yes, you did.
Anyone here know Mr Love?
Very well, in that case, I
will have to meet him myself.
Have him come to my
office at three o'clock.
Dr Warfield, we don't exactly know
how to get in touch with Mr Love,
on such short notice, that is.
What do you mean? Is he some
kind of roving bum or something?
- I've never heard of such a thing.
- I might see him tonight.
That's not good enough. I want
to see him today at three.
I beg your pardon,
Dr Warfield, but I...
I just might be able to see my way clear,
possibly, to contact this Mr... Love.
Professor Kelp, I don't
care who contacts him.
Just get him here by three o'clock
today or forget the whole thing.
Meeting dismissed.
- Where's your pad?
- About a mile from campus.
I have bought the craziest new drapes...
You mean my dictation pad.
- Sorry, I'll get it immediately.
- Never mind. What did you want?
Mr Love is waiting outside to
see you and he's a gasser...
I mean, shall I ask him to come in?
- If you can do so without fainting.
- Yes, sir.
You gonna make that
your life's work, baby?
Hey, here.
Mr Love?
Buddy to you. What's your moniker?
What do they call you?
Mortimer, Harvey, Norman,
Homer? Which is it?
You may call me Dr
Warfield, young man.
OK, Doc it is.
What kinda doctor are you, sweetie?
Sawbones, is that the idea?
Or a headshrinker? I went
to them once, you dig?
Headshrinker. Told me I had a dual
personality, split, schizo and all that jazz.
He charges me $82, so I give him $41 and
say get the rest from the other guy.
What's eating you?
Mr Love, I sent for you in
regard to the senior prom.
However, after seeing
you, my door...
Would you think I was terribly rude if
I asked you the name of your tailor?
- That's wild. Absolutely gorgeous.
- Oh, you mean this?
- Just beautiful.
- Actually, it's just a ready-made suit.
You're kidding?
Well, sort of a handmade-to-order
ready-made suit off the rack.
Just magnificent. I think you're modest.
Is that the picture, sweetie?
You've got the perfect physique and
anything you put on swings, right?
Ever consider going
into show business?
- I did a few school plays...
- Nutty...
Girls backstage mob you, swamp you?
Is that the picture?
- Stay there, don't move.
- You might say that in my time...
Sorry, Doc. You all right?
Did you really do a
job in show business?
Anyone ever say you got
a Cary Grant-ish look?
Ever see him walk towards a girl?
Try that walk. Let me see, I'm just
curious. Walk like Cary Grant. Beautiful.
Beautiful. Sure you're doing
the right thing working here?
What did you do? Shakespeare?
- I knew it... Hamlet...
- Hamlet...
- Would you do it?
- Mr Love, it's been so long...
Would you do it for me, Doctor?
Come on, baby. It's gotta be wild.
- Go ahead.
- Let's see...
- To be...
- Hold it! Do it right.
Get on the stage. Let
me be your audience.
- The faculty...!
- It's the best thing in the world for you.
- Get up there and perform.
- If you insist...
- Let it out.
- To be, or...
Hold it. Let's make it a stage.
Let's make it right.
You're gonna be beautiful,
just beautiful. Lay it on me.
Am I in the light?
- To be, or not...
- Hold it! Do it right.
Be in show business. Hamlet, right?
You gotta play it all the way.
Hamlet... Here, put it on. It's
gonna make you feel beautiful.
- I feel it already.
- You'll play it like it's never been played.
- Go on. Let it out. Enjoy it.
- It's a difference...
- To be, or...
- Hold it. Do it right. Hamlet?
A prince? You gotta go all
the way with the sword.
You dig Hamlet. Do it.
Enjoy it. It's beautiful.
Beautiful. You've wasted your
life with this school jazz.
Well, I've often thought
of chucking it all...
- To be, or...
- Hold it.
Royalty is one thing, a crown.
Do it right. Hamlet. Do it right.
- Have the crown. Be Hamlet.
- My hat...!
It's the way it should be.
You've got the crown.
- I think I have it.
- Do Hamlet and really let it out.
You're beautiful.
To be, or not to be;
that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune...
- Oh, beautiful. Doctor, you choked me.
- I'm not through...
You choked me. It was gorgeous.
The prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- See you at the prom, Doc?
- Oh, yes.
- Behind the footlights?
- We'll have you there...
- I knew it, baby. You're beautiful.
- Carry on the great tradition of theatre.
- Practise that Shakespeare.
- At the prom, Mr Love.
To be, or not to be;
that is the question...
Jennifer, what am I
to do, Jennifer?
Have you ever thought of taking poison?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, Julius, taking poison!
Hi... Doctor.
- Kelp.
- Yes, sir?
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. Do you lead?
I'm sorry. I did misunderstand.
I get carried away, what with the music.
It was a toe-tapper, I must admit.
It's rare to hear instrumentation these
days, what with folk singers, etc...
Would you care for some
refreshment, Miss Lemmon?
Thank you, I think I would, but let
me go. You don't have to bother.
There's no bother.
It would be my pleasure.
- Kelp...
- Yes, I'll have a lemonade, too.
- Kelp, will you get us two lemonades?
- I'm terribly sorry, Doctor.
I was again so terribly distressed
at that wonderful toe-tapper.
Well, zip and I'm gone.
Hi, Professor.
- Oh, Stell.
- Stell?
That is, Miss Purdy... I'm sorry.
How are you? Are you
having a good time, dear?
I'm having a good time, but...
I'd have a much better time if
somebody would ask me to dance.
Cat got your tongue, Professor?
No, the punch bowl has my arm.
- I didn't realise...
- Let me help you.
Thank you. I guess I'm
just accident prone.
- Don't worry about it.
- I won't.
- Come on, let's dance.
- Oh, yes, all right. Let me leave that.
That sounds like a splendid idea.
I neglected to mention, Miss Purdy, you're
looking very beautiful this evening.
You must be looking forward to
seeing your Buddy Love tonight.
- How did you know that?
- Everyone knows he's appearing tonight.
Oh... Here. I guess I'm looking
forward to seeing him.
But I can't figure out why.
Well, he is quite
good-looking, is he not?
Oh, yes, he is, but that
means nothing to me.
He... I'm told he is a young man
with a very nice personality.
On the contrary, he's rude, disrespectful,
self-centred and discourteous.
Then it's not his nice personality.
Hardly.
I'm told that he's quite
talented, though.
Oh, yes, he's very talented.
But talent comes in many forms.
I believe intelligence is a
greater talent than anything.
If Buddy has any real intelligence, he has
a fantastic talent for keeping it hidden.
I see, well, then,
evidently, Miss Purdy,
whatever you see in this young
man it must be very well buried.
I think you're getting warm.
Well, then, perhaps, and
it's just a possibility,
he chooses to keep the inner man
locked up so that no one steps on him.
But he should know I don't
want to step on him.
Maybe someday I'll get
to prove it to him.
If he ever unlocks that inner
man and lets him loose,
so that I can grab
him and hold him.
- I appreciate it.
- What?
That... What I meant
was, that's very nice.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's show time. Gather round!
We'll get the show on the road.
Before we go on, I'd like you to
meet some of the specialists:
There's Butch Stone up
there, you remember Butch.
My kid brother, Stumpy Brown.
Stumpy not only plays the
trombone, but also sings.
Butch Stone is known for 'A
Good Man is Hard to Find'.
We've a great show lined up
for you, a few surprises...
Why do men keep
running away from me?
The formula...
- Jennifer!
- Hi, there.
Jennifer.
My formula.
Th-Th-The formula.
Jennifer, you've eaten
all of my formula.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, shut up, you stupid bird!
Then I can't suggest you
call your mother and father
and get them to read the formula
from the copy you sent...
Oh, what a wonderful bird!
Where's the phone?
Long distance will be area code...
Oh, yes, area code...
Sp... Sp... Splendid
idea, Jennifer.
H... Hello, Father.
Hello... I say, hello, Father.
This is Julius. Yeah, I...
Julius... J... Yes, your son.
Would you be good enough, Dad,
to open the formula for me and read
it to me so I can mark it down.
Yes, I certainly... Actually,
I'd appreciate it, yes...
It's just going to
have to be enough.
Where can he be? I hope nothing's
happened to prevent his getting here.
He better get here or
there'll be a riot.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the next performer
is one of the easiest
chores I've ever had.
Simply because this card I'm
holding is the announcement
that the performer wants
read exactly as written.
Makes it easy.
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting
the world's greatest everything.
The best dressed, the
swingingest performer,
and one of the nicest
guys in the whole world.
Here he is, the 1963 senior
prom's answer to Don Juan,
Mr Buddy Love.
<i>‚ô™ Up at dawn and sleepy and yawning</i>
<i>‚ô™ Still the taste of wine</i>
<i>‚ô™ Then I remember
you're mine and...</i>
<i>‚ô™ I've got a world that's fine</i>
<i>‚ô™ What's before me?
Routines that bore me</i>
<i>‚ô™ Punch the clock at eight</i>
<i>‚ô™ But what a lucky guy I am</i>
<i>‚ô™ I've got a world that's great</i>
<i>‚ô™ Atom bombs</i>
<i>‚ô™ Cape Canaveral and false alarms</i>
<i>‚ô™ Half the universe is up in arms</i>
<i>‚ô™ So I flip a little, too
Until I'm holding you</i>
<i>‚ô™ What's the hassle?
I'll buy the castle</i>
<i>‚ô™ We can live like kings</i>
<i>‚ô™ If we're together for ever</i>
<i>‚ô™ I've got a world that...</i>
<i>‚ô™ You've got a world that...</i>
<i>‚ô™ We've got a world that swings</i>
<i>‚ô™ I'd like to take you through
this wild, wonderful venture</i>
<i>‚ô™ Fly like a kite through
space, no strings</i>
<i>‚ô™ I don't want to lose
that bell that rings</i>
<i>‚ô™ I've got a world that...</i>
<i>‚ô™ You've got a world that...</i>
<i>‚ô™ We've got a world
that swi-i-i-ings</i>
<i>‚ô™ We've got a world that swings ‚ô™</i>
You're very wise.
If you'll hold it a second,
I'll thrill you some more.
I'd like to do a tune for you that's
been a favourite of the gang at the...
you should pardon the expression,
Dr Warfield... Purple Pit.
You dig? It's that old
standard, 'Black Magic'.
<i>‚ô™ That old... ‚ô™</i>
<i>‚ô™ That old... ‚ô™</i>
I, er...
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not usually at...
I'm not usually at
a loss for words,
but if you'll just...
bear with me a moment, I think
I might be able to explain.
It happened some time ago...
being a scientist, I just
happened to have stumbled on
one of the curious
mysteries of science.
I found myself...
so curious that I was
unable to just stop.
Nonetheless...
I never really knew what
was going to prevail.
I do know now that I should've
left it alone... actually.
But...
it is a very, very
hard thing to do,
particularly when you've found that
you've been able to do something
that so many others failed to do.
Therefore...
Actually, I have no real
defence for my actions,
other than...
I had no control over what I
said or did as Buddy Love.
I can only say...
I hope...
I hope I haven't hurt anyone...
hurt anyone.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
I didn't mean to do...
anything that wasn't
of a kind nature.
Learning a lesson in life is...
is never...
is never really too late.
And I think that the...
the lesson that I learned
came just in time.
I don't want to...
I don't want to be
something that I'm not.
I didn't like being someone else.
At the same time,
I'm very glad I was.
'Cause I found out something
that I never knew.
You might as well like yourself.
Just think about all the time you're
going to have to spend with you.
And...
Well...
If you don't think much of
yourself, how can others?
That's what I found out.
Dr Warfield, I'm very sorry and...
I like it here at the
university very much.
I hope that...
I hope that after you hear the facts, you
won't think too terribly wrong of me.
I love everybody here and I...
I wouldn't really like
to leave... actually.
Can I be of any
assistance, Professor?
No, thank you very much. I'll...
I'll have to just try and work
this out myself, thank you.
Well, there's really nothing
to work out, Professor,
other than understand that
just being one person is more than
enough for any human being to handle.
Do you mean that...
- Well, you have to understand that...
- Sh!
I'm only trying to say that I'd never want
to spend my life with anyone like Buddy.
Being the wife of a professor
would be much more normal and...
much happier.
Oh, Stella!
See, I... I told you
I'm accident prone.
That's actually...
"The psychological properties
of visual quality and quantity
"can be represented conveniently
by a three-dimensional diagram.
Three-dimensional diagram,
right. Oddly enough...
Thanks, sonny. Thanks for
telling us where our kid works.
Not so loud, Elmer, dear.
Loud? Who the devil's loud?
Oh-oh! Whoah-oh!
Marge, Marge, Marge, Marge.
Hey, class, how are you?
Good to be amongst.
Well, well...
If it isn't the square bookworm
we laughingly referred to as our son.
Here, bookworm, have a cigar.
Go ahead, go on. Pure Havana,
straight from Havana, yeah.
Cost us $6 million ransom.
Pretty good, huh?
Good to see you again, Julius.
Mush and hush. Mouth,
mouth, hush, mush.
Here, now, back, back.
Hush. Nothing.
Here it is, kids. Are you tired of being
a square? Tired of a dull existence?
Well, for one dollar, the
tenth part of a sawbuck,
try Kelp's Kool Tonic.
You, too, can be the
life of the party.
He's right, kids, it's a gasser.
Step right up, folks.
Be somebody, be anybody.
- Sixteen bottles, look, here.
- Five...
Wait, wait, wait, Stella.
Wait, sweetheart, what have I done?
What has he done? What will I do?
I know what you'll do.
Do you have the licence?
- Yes, here it is, dear.
- What are we waiting for?
What about the formula, what
about Mother, what about Father?
What's done is done. And we
have our own lives to live.
Come on, let's go.
Yes, actually, Stella, what's
right is right, let's split.
