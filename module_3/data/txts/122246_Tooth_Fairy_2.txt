Hey, what're we doing here?
They're giving that car away?
That thing's sweet.
Janie's birthday party
starts in 10 minutes.
I know, but this'll just
take a couple of seconds.
- Larry.
- Oh, come on, it'll be awesome.
Hey, I'll meet you up
at the raffle table.
Larry.
It's hard to believe,
but you're even more
beautiful when you're angry.
- Hello, Brooke.
Hello, Beauregard.
Nice to find you here.
My family's auto dealership
is sponsoring this raffle.
You know, we're giving
away a pretty nice car.
Hank, come on.
- Hurry up, Ernie.
- Go in.
Would you mind putting these in, dear?
Thanks.
Good luck, lady.
I cannot believe you're
still with Larry Guthrie.
Yep, but if he doesn't drive me
to my niece's birthday party
in the next
two minutes,
- all bets are off.
- Really?
- Hey, do you mind if... Oh.
- Back off.
Why don't you give me a call
if you need a car or...
Or anything else.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
<i>Welcome, everybody.</i>
<i>Who wants to win a car?</i>
Dude, the dream car of all cars.
<i>Let's find out</i>
<i>- who that lucky bowler is going to be.
- Us!</i>
Please.
<i>Our lucky bowler is...</i>
<i>Larry Guthrie!</i>
- All right, Larry! <i>Yeah!</i>
- You gotta be kidding me!
High-five mine! High-five mine!
Peanut butter! Peanut butter!
Honey, how cool is this?
It's like winning an Oscar.
You promised me you would
go to Janie's party.
But she's one year old.
She ain't gonna know I'm there.
It's not about the party, it's
about you keeping your promises.
If there's one thing that little kid'll like,
it'd be knowing I won that muscle car.
You just don't get it, do you?
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let's
hear it for Larry Guthrie.</i>
Honey. Honey, come on.
Hey, baby, it is a Camaro.
<i>Let's bowl.</i>
<i>All Larry has to do is make
the famed 7-10 split.</i>
<i>Can he do it?</i>
Let's see what you got.
You still have two chances left.
Larry, that was so, so close.
But, hey, no pressure at all.
You still have one chance left.
He's way too tight.
We've got to calm him down.
Time out.
I need some nachos, pronto!
- Chow down, buddy.
- Munch them down. Go, boy!
- You feel good?  Yeah
Larry, hey, hey, hey, we don't
have all day, all right?
That's what I needed. Nachos.
It's like a B12 shot.
- Go for it, Larry! Go!
- Let's do this!
I got it! Yeah, yeah, I got it!
Now I'm good. Now I'm ready.
All right, Brooke.
This one's for you.
Hey, why don't you stop
fiddling with your own car,
come over here and try and
work on somebody else's?
All right, I'm coming.
For Pete's sake, you guys.
All right, now try it.
Who's the man?
Hey, let me see
that sports page.
He's gonna find out
sooner or later.
Find out what?
Hank, I tell you what, you
are a bad poker player.
I thought it...
You guys broke up
over a year ago.
What, you thought she was
never gonna move on?
Thought she was just
playing hard to get.
I thought she was
just being smart.
That's enough.
Larry, why don't you
channel that anger
into repairing a car instead
of doing something stupid?
Stupid ain't in my vocabulary.
Perfect.
You're marrying
Beauregard Billings?
- Beauregard Billings, seriously?
- Just wait one second, okay?
- You're marrying Beauregard?
- Ms. Miller, I found my sketch pad!
- Good.
- Not now, kid. I'm not signing autographs.
Still humble as ever.
She wants an autograph.
Sydney, do you have any
idea who this man is?
The janitor?
The janitor. I'm Larry Guthrie,
the bowling champion
Metro County Miracle.
Doesn't really ring a bell.
Boy, what're they teaching kids nowadays?
Obviously not about me.
Sydney, why don't you draw me a
really pretty picture, okay?
I need to have a word
with the janitor.
Beauregard Billings.
- He goes by Bo now.
- “Goes by Bo now.“.
He's running for mayor, so
he changes his name to Bo?
He hasn't worked an honest day in his life.
Unbelievable.
People change, Larry.
Just because you never grew up
doesn't mean other people can't.
Why do I wanna grow up?
I'm the Metro Lanes' Miracle Man.
I'm awesome.
You slipped on nacho
cheese and got lucky.
All right, I'm 50% awesome.
But I'm still 1,000 times more
awesome than Beauregard Billings.
I don't want awesome,
I want an adult.
Somebody who is ready for the
responsibility of a family.
And I waited along time for
you to become that person,
and you didn't.
- Well, I was gonna...
Oh, boy.
Who wants a Bo Billings Frisbee?
Here you go.
Remember, vote for Bo Billings.
- Who wants a stress ball?
- I do!
- Stress ball! There they are!
- Me! Me! Me!
Now remember to tell your parents
to vote for Bo Billings, all right?
Well, if it isn't Larry Guthrie.
Hey, save your stress ball on me there, Billings.
I'm voting for the other guy.
Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I gotta go, Larry.
It was nice seeing you.
- Yeah.
- Bye.
All right, I'll see you later.
All the people in Ocala
she could go out with,
and she goes out
with that goofball.
He's a fraud, is what he is.
There he is.
Come on, you guys. Shh!
Oh, Ashton!
Whoa!
Real funny, guys.
Hey, hold on. Hold on a sec.
- You wanna make a quick five bucks?
- Sure.
Okay, honey, be
completely honest.
Which one do you like better,
this one or this one?
Wow, they're both so similar.
Well, I mean, I am photogenic, sweetie.
I understand.
- Yeah.
- But, really, try to pick the best one.
- Come on.
- Hey, mister.
Look, I made this for
the tooth fairy.
Yeah, that's pretty good, kid.
- Perfect, I'll use them both.
- Fire!
Done. Oh!
Hey, what're you guys doing?
What's that about
the tooth fairy?
Oh, I have a loose tooth. See?
Oh, that's awesome. That's good.
No, no, the shirt's fine, sweetie.
Look at the face.
So, I made this for her.
That's good, kid. That's cool.
Wow, and you know what?
You're gonna have to take this one, too, so...
- But, you know what, sweetie...
- I wanna be an artist when I grow up.
Well, you ought to stay a
kid as long as you can.
You don't wanna grow up any
sooner than you have to.
- Why?
- Well...
So sorry.
Let me just dry you off real fast.
- Growing up stinks.
- Why?
'Cause things don't always turn
out the way you'd planned it.
Why?
True love is a fairy tale,
just like the tooth...
Uh...
No, no.
No, there is a tooth... Listen.
Hey, did you hear that story
about the tooth fairy?
Once upon a time, there was
this little tooth fairy...
- No, kid! Where're you going?
- I'm telling on you!
Hey, kid, hey.
Get back. Kid! Kid!
- Ms. Miller, Ms. Miller!
Def-Con 4! Def-Con 4!
Hold on, kid. Let me borrow you.
What are you doing, dude?
A little game called
“saving my butt.“.
- Honey, what's wrong?
That man told me something
bad about the tooth fairy.
All right.
Wait, come here. What is this?
What...
Oh, honey, no, come here.
Come here.
<i>Dreams come true!</i>
<i>Dreams come true!</i>
<i>Dreams come true!</i>
Greatest day in my life.
Greatest day in my
life, right there.
<i>I'm Bo Billings, and we 're
gonna make it happen.</i>
<i>- You, me, all of us.
- Oh,</i> please.
<i>- We 're in it together.
- Billings.</i>
<i>Mmm-mmm.</i>
You know what happens if
you eat too much chicken.
You turn into a chicken.
I'm pretty sure that
ain't gonna happen.
Mmm-mmm. It's a scientific fact.
Haven't you ever heard the
expression, “You are what you eat“?
You're just trying to get
that last chicken wing.
How dare you.
All right, well, there's
only one way to settle this.
- Yeah, a barbecue sauce mustache contest.
One, two, three, go!
Nothing beats a Tom Selleck.
Dadgummit.
- Unless you're Rollie Fingers. Well played.
- Mmm-hmm.
Thank you. It is a close call.
Maybe we should put our
mustaches together
and see what happens?
Gotta tell you, I
kind of like that.
You know what, Brooke?
I'm about to stop you from
making the biggest mistake
of your entire life.
Huh! It's a piece of paper.
“Department of Dissemination
of Disbelief.“.
What does that mean?
Cheese and crackers,
she was right.
I'm a chicken! I'm a chicken!
Mr. Guthrie, my name is Nyx.
Do you know why you're here?
Well, because I ate too much chicken
and you turned me into a chicken.
Great, another genius.
For sure I thought
I was a chicken.
This is just a dream.
This isn't a dream, Mr. Guthrie.
Well, then it's a
chicken-induced hallucination.
Believe me, I've OD'd
on enough chicken
to know what I'm talking
about there, little girl.
“Little girl?“
I am Nyxaviera Wiz.
Do you know who I am?
I am the 113-time, yes, the
highest score in Fairyland,
Tooth Fairy of the Year.
I was making Tooth
Fairy All-Star teams
before Columbus
discovered America.
All right, well, chill out, kid.
Jiminy Christmas! Lay off the caffeine.
No, I'm not just some little girl,
and all of Fairyland knows that.
I'm a tooth fairy legend!
And now I'm a case worker.
Your case worker.
Look, maybe we got off
on the wrong foot,
but I'm begging you, please turn
me back to the way I was before.
Please, I promise I'll lay off the chicken.
Done with it.
No more fried chicken,
baked chicken,
breasted chicken, chicken pot pie.
Done.
Nuggets, fingers,
tenders, tacos,
delicious, by the way, hot
dish, chicken-in-a-biscuit.
Did I say nuggets?
'Cause they're delicious.
General Cho's, or Chow, I don't know how you say it.
I always say General Cho.
I won't eat that.
Chicken sammiches,
chicken chow mein.
Chicken wings, obviously.
Hot, mild, teriyaki,
barbecue, honey mustard.
Chicken and dumplings.
Boy, who am I kidding?
I love chicken!
Enough! Now sit.
Read this.
What's this?
Welcome, disseminator
of disbelief.
You didn't think tooth
fairies were real, did you?
Well, you're wrong.
And now, you're one of us.
<i>When a child loses a tooth and puts
it under their pillow at night,</i>
<i>a tooth fairy comes to
collect that tooth.</i>
<i>But tooth fairies only
collect teeth from children</i>
<i>who believe in the tooth fairy,</i>
<i>because a tiny bit of that belief
lives within every child's tooth.</i>
<i>That's the magic that
fuels Fairyland.</i>
Thanks to you, a young
boy no longer believes.
<i>You have broken fairy law.</i>
<i>- As punishment,</i>
<i>you must temporarily
serve as a tooth fairy.</i>
<i>Your sentence is to collect
10 teeth in 10 days</i>
<i>from children in your region,</i>
<i>Metro County, Florida.</i>
<i>Whenever a tooth
collection comes up,</i>
<i>you will automatically
transform into a tooth fairy.</i>
No ifs, ands, or buts.
Good luck. You'll need it.
And what if I don't do it?
I'm taking away
your best memory.
The Metro County Miracle.
You mean to tell me you'd
erase the Metro County...
Can and will.
What's that?
All temps get a ration
of sleeping powder.
Use this to get past pesky
cats and guard dogs.
Sleeping powder.
Boy, it don't smell very good.
Gosh, you dunderhead.
Oh.
What happened?
Sleeping powder.
If you ever get
caught, use this.
Amnesia powder.
If someone sees you as the tooth fairy,
just dust them with a little bit of this
and say, “You never saw
the tooth fairy.“.
Now repeat after me.
“You never saw the tooth fairy.“.
For Pete's sake, I'm not
gonna say something stupid.
All right.
“You never saw the tooth fairy.“.
Now go get some
rest, Mr. Guthrie.
- You start tomorrow.
- Yeah, but if...
Whoa!
Man, that was the worst
dream I ever had.
So real.
I ain't eating chicken
late any more.
I sure wish that was a dream.
You know what? I still got time to
prove she's marrying the wrong man.
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.
You wanna what?
I wanna be a part of the
after school program.
I think it'd be fun.
- Larry.
- What?
Most of these kids are
more mature than you are.
Plus, I heard what
you said to Gabe.
That was Bo talking to him.
They were talking about the tooth fairy.
Now, I wasn't saying that.
All kinds of conversations about it.
That was Bo done that.
You're not just doing this to try
to prove something to me, are you?
Because it's way
too late for that.
Come on, Brooke, get over
yourself, seriously?
I mean, not every conversation is about you.
I mean, go ahead.
If you wanna make the biggest mistake
of your life, go right ahead.
But this ain't about you.
This is about me,
and I love kids.
And I wanna... How you doing?
Look at me. I love you.
- Love you. Love you.
- Uncool, man.
Come on, it looks like
you could use the help.
- Ms. Miller.
- Come on, Brooke.
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Sure, sure. Yeah, honey, you can go for it.
Can you please tell Matthew
to give me back my lunchbox?
- No, Ashton, honey, it's right over here.
- Ms. Miller, I lost my doll.
- Right where you left it.
- See how busy you are?
- See how busy you are?
- Ms. Miller, this pen is all dried out.
Sweetie, just swap it out
for a red one, okay?
Ms. Miller, can you
help us build this?
Yeah, 10 minutes, okay?
And this guitar is broken.
It needs new batteries.
Play air guitar, man.
See what I'm
talking about?
Come on, Brookie. Brookster.
- I can't afford to pay you.
-  Pay me?
I'm insulted. I'm in!
I had to let my entire staff go, so
that's the only reason I'm doing this.
- I know.
- Because I'm desperate.
- And I'm in.
- Really desperate.
- I'm in.
- Really desperate.
- Done.
- Like bottom-of-the-barrel desperate.
I'm in.
- All right.
- Sweet.
I am gonna finish planting the
garden with half the kids.
You are in charge
of the other half.
Piece of cake. What do I do?
Arts and crafts?
I mean, arts and crafts, awesome!
I love arts and crafts.
This'll be sweet.
Love arts and crafts.
Shoot, this ain't
gonna be that hard.
- Put those down!
- You guys, you got...
Don't throw that! Don't...
Put it down! Put it down!
You're gonna get hurt!
Stop! Don't do it!
Enough!
Enough!
What's wrong with everybody?
- We're bored.
- Yeah!
All right.
Well, hey, I know what we can do.
Let's go play lawn darts.
Isn't that dangerous?
Yeah, I guess that would be.
Let's go hunting.
What, are you crazy?
Yeah, I guess there
ain't nothing to hunt.
Man, what kind of an after
school program is this?
Hey, wait. I got an idea!
- Let's have us a genuine snowball fight.
- What?
- What?
- This is Florida. There's no snow.
- Yeah.
- Ye of little belief.
You ain't gotta have snow to have a
good old snowball fight in Florida.
You wanna see how?
<i>Well, you just get yourself
some ﬂour and some pantyhose.</i>
<i>Fill it to the brim.
Tie yourself a knot.</i>
<i>Do it 100 more times.</i>
<i>Get some of these fancy
goggles and then...</i>
Let the games begin.
<i>I just want some satisfaction</i>
<i>'Cause I can get none here.</i>
<i>I need a new main attraction.</i>
<i>One that I could wear.</i>
<i>It's gonna start a
chain reaction</i>
<i>I need a little imagination.</i>
<i>Shelter from the rain.</i>
- Time for the secret weapon, boys.
- Yeah!
What is going on here?
Brooke, jeez.
What did you do to this place?
You were supposed to be
setting a good example.
Brooke, we were just
having some fun.
This is exactly the kind of
thing that I was worried about.
You are not ready for this
kind of responsibility.
You're not ready for any
kind of responsibility.
Brooke,
you look ridiculous.
Listen, we were just trying to bond.
I was having fun with the kids.
I'm ready for responsibility.
Give me another chance.
Just one more chance.
One more chance.
But you pull another stunt
like this, and you are done.
- I won't do it.
- Now clean up this mess!
I will get it cleaned up.
Thank you.
Hey, which one of you kids wanna
help me clean up in here?
See you!
Come on, Snappers!
Come on, let's get
to the first down.
- Let's get to the first down!
- Come on now, let's go!
Thirty! 20! 10! He's got it.
<i>Touchdown.</i>
I didn't even have
chicken today.
- What?
- Nothing. I'll be right back.
Hey, grab some more soda!
No way.
This has to be a dream.
Wake up, wake up.
Okay.
This is gonna hurt, but
I gotta wake up. Okay.
Oh, man.
Guess I am a tooth fairy.
So, did they score a touchdown?
Larry, why're you dressed
like a ballerina?
That is a good question.
That is a fine question.
And I'm gonna tell you why.
'Cause I'm in a play.
I'm in <i>The</i> Nutcracker.
Matter of fact, I
am the nutcracker.
<i>The Nutcracker?</i>
Dadgum right.
Check this out, ye of non-belief.
Pretty good, huh?
You have lost your
ever-loving mind.
Uh-huh.
I normally don't dance
good without my resin.
You will forget there was
ever a tooth fairy here.
And while you're at it, Ernie,
you'll forget that I
owe you 20 bucks.
Now let's see what
address I gotta go to.
Oh, boy.
“Sydney Wilder, Walnut Street.“.
Let's go get some teeth.
Nice dog. Shh! Nice.
Stay back, I'm the tooth fairy.
I command you.
Do not... Do not eat me!
Bad dog!
Bad dog!
What the heck is that thing?
What?
You're just a little pig.
I ain't scared of no pig.
I'll tell you what, I'd eat more pork.
It just lays on me. It just lays on me.
Come on. Hey, look, keep it down.
Would you keep it...
For Pete's sake, out of
all the kids in Ocala,
I gotta get one
with a guard pig.
- Crusher.
- What's going on out here, boy?
Put a cork in it. The game's on.
Awesome.
A little sleeping dust and a moon pie.
Ultimate weapon.
Good night.
<i>I cannot
believe what I am seeing.</i>
<i>This is college football
at its finest, folks.</i>
Go, go, go!
Come on. Come on, Snappers!
- Quiet. You'll wake Sydney.
- Shh!
<i>Holy cow, I cannot believe the
comeback that I am witnessing, folks.</i>
<i>- You do not want to take...
- Oh!</i> Yes!
Come on. Come on, Snappers!
Go!
Go, Snappers?
Call 911! Call 911!
Hold on, I can explain.
Wait.
Aren't you that bowling guy?
If you mean the Metro
County Miracle Man,
guilty as charged.
What are you doing in our house
dressed like that?
That is a dadgum good question.
I'm not a ballerina,
I'll tell you that much.
Wait a minute. You're one of them
singing telegram guys, aren't you?
That's right. That's what I am.
A singing telegram fella.
Uh, but I don't sing
good without my resin.
Let me get my resin out.
Oh, boy.
Oh, God. You gotta...
<i>Jingle bells, jingle
bells Jingle all the way.</i>
<i>How come we're always
passing the ball...</i>
When we could easily
run the next play?
How come we do it?
Don't under...
<i>Mine eyes have seen the
glory of the coming...</i>
Please leave our house.
Good idea.
Jeez, what're you doing in here?
Pink? What're you doing?
My bowling ball!
It looks prettier that way.
What is wrong with you?
You're not a tooth fairy,
you're a psycho.
No, not my bass!
Man, that's the biggest bass I've
ever had that didn't need batteries.
Oh!
That's my Metro Miracle
bowling trophy.
Now you've gone too far.
This morning, Sydney Wilder
looked under her pillow and found
her tooth was still there.
And if that little
girl stops believing,
I'm taking away
your best memory.
Or even worse.
Have I made myself clear?
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Thank goodness that's over with.
Oh, come on.
Stinking tooth fairy.
What am I, Lady Gaga?
It's the snack horn, kids!
Who wants a juice box?
Here's an apple.
You look like an apple.
Brooke, you want a fruit punch?
No, I'm good. Thanks, Larry.
Did you bring all this?
You're darn right I did.
That's the magic I bring to the table.
I'm impressed.
- Well, you need one, you let me know.
- Yeah, I will.
- You want a burrito?
- Later.
All right. Cold juice boxes.
Fruity punches and apples.
Here's a fruity punch.
You want a juice box?
- Yes, please.
- There it is. You want a juice box?
I want a burrito.
Well, I was kind of saving the burritos for me.
How about a juice box?
I want a burrito.
- Burrito!
- All right.
Simmer down there, hot sauce.
Chill out.
Hey, Sydney, what you drawing?
Is that the tooth fairy?
'Cause something tells me the tooth fairy
might be giving you a visit tonight.
You don't believe me, ask Gabe.
Gabe will tell you.
Ain't that right, Gabe, buddy?
Go ahead, tell her
about the tooth fairy.
Sorry, I don't believe
in fairy tales any more.
Oh, come on, Gabe. Gabe, Gabe.
Tooth fairy, come on.
Seriously, dude,
we're not babies.
- Yeah.
- Well, all right.
For your information, you'll
see I'm telling the truth.
You wait and see.
You just wait and you'll see...
My burritos!
Five-second rule on the ground.
All right, maybe that one.
That one won't work.
You like moon pies so much,
here's a whole
truckload of them.
Yeah!
<i>Get ready
for some of the biggest,</i>
<i>baddest, loudest monster
truck action ever.</i>
This is good.
No, concentrate.
Gotta get that tooth.
Burritos. Dadgummit, I should've
never had six of them.
- Did you just hear something?
- Yeah, the...
Go check on Sydney. Go.
Oh.
What was it? What's the matter?
I don't think Sydney should
eat your meatloaf any more.
Dadgum right.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the stage, Mr. Larry Guthrie!
They said he couldn't do it.
There's no way he's gonna do it.
But he did. He got the tooth.
He got the tooth nobody thought
he could get, and there it is.
It's a beautiful
specimen, it is.
It's you. Hey, check it out.
I got a tooth.
Yes, you collected one tooth.
It took you two days and
all the magic I gave you.
- Yeah, but I...
- Follow me.
Put the tooth under the pillow.
You can at least say please.
That's pretty cool.
Just do that nine more times and
your sentence will be lifted.
Nine more...
Are you sure there's even nine
kids that still believe any more?
That's your problem, not mine.
This story is called “Sydney
and the Really Loud Piglet.“.
Hey, Gabe, you wanna listen
to some of the story?
No.
All right.
So Crusher snapped and
stammered ferociously.
Oh, he was a mean piglet.
The tooth fairy didn't budge.
She was there to get Sydney's
tooth, no matter what.
And the tooth fairy leaped over
the fence very gracefully,
right over the fence.
She went like this. She jumped.
And when she jumped
up in the air,
she took her hand and she throwed
out all the magic sleeping dust.
And it hit him in the head.
He was mad.
He was out like a ton of bricks.
Hit the floor.
Tooth fairy story again?
Lame.
Tell me about it.
Well, do you wanna
know what happened?
Yes.
Ask Sydney.
The tooth fairy took my tooth.
And when I woke up, there
was money under my pillow.
And it smelled like rotten eggs.
Well, for the record,
the tooth fairy said
it smelled like rotten
eggs when she got there.
Who wants the tooth fairy
to come visit their house?
Well, dadgum.
Let's get them teeth a-wiggling.
Hey, guys, I got an idea.
Follow me.
Where you going?
Hey, no, don't do that.
Put that down.
That's not right.
You guys, seriously?
Honestly, you're doing that?
Come on, now. For Pete's sake,
would you put those down?
Hey, why don't you guys set
up for some soccer over here?
I'm gonna go check on Mr. Larry.
Okay, ready.
Whoa, whoa, ladies.
What are you kids doing?
Trying to make some cash
money from the tooth fairy.
Right. Larry?
How was the nature walk?
Shouldn't you be out there
getting me a tooth, you slacker?
You know, I'm gonna
go get you a tooth,
but there's a little thing on TV right
now called a fishing tournament,
which I was enjoying immensely.
Larry, for once in your life,
can you stop being a 10-percenter
and try to be a 110-percenter?
What're you talking about?
I've already got the case card right here.
I know what I'm doing tonight.
Hey, you know what? You think I can
have some more amnesia powder?
I'm almost out of it.
Fine.
What is that?
These are “glow of the
firefly“ berries.
They make you light
up like a firefly.
Hence the name.
Can I have some of those,
'cause where I'm going tonight,
it gets really dark at night.
Yes, it
does get dark at night.
Your powers of perception
never cease to amaze me.
But very well, you may
have three firefly berries
and a refill of amnesia powder.
- All right.
- Anything else that you want from me?
Well, yeah, there is.
I been meaning to talk to you about it.
I need to get a new outfit.
Don't push your luck.
It's not comfortable, though.
The more comfortable I am,
the more teeth I get.
I see. How about this?
What am I, Captain Cavity?
They'll laugh me right
out of the house.
Or this?
Seriously?
Is this better?
Yeah, this is good.
I'm gonna come over that
table in about five seconds.
I think it's you.
Can't you just give me
something normal to wear?
If I give you overalls, will you stop
bothering me and go get me some teeth?
Tell you what, you
get me overalls,
I'll bring you a whole
wheelbarrow full of teeth.
But they're pink.
- Bye.
- Wait a sec...
Boy, you sure do love
pink, don't you?
What in the world?
450.
Boy, it's awful dark in there.
<i>Hmm.</i>
I don't know.
Well, here goes nothing.
Phew! That's nasty.
Well, guess that was a dud.
What in the world?
What is that? Oh, man.
Oh, boy, I hope that
ain't permanent.
Funny, real funny.
Some of that fairy
trickery, probably.
What the...
Why, I ought to...
There it is.
Unbelievable.
See you later, Ellie.
- Bye, Larry.
- See you.
What's up, Gabe? Hey, dude.
How's that tooth treating you?
Oh, wow.
Now remember, when it falls out, you
need to put that under your pillow.
Why, what's the point?
Oh, come on, I thought
you'd be over that by now.
Hey, look. You got a pretty
good talent for art, son,
so I went up and I
got you these books.
There's all kinds of pictures and it
tells you all about the artists in them.
If you read them, I guarantee you,
you'll be just as good as they are.
These are for me?
Yeah, they're for you.
Just make sure you take them back to the
library when you're done with them.
- Thanks.
- Let me see that tooth again.
Oh, man, that's gross.
You need to get that tooth taken out.
That's sick.
I'm gonna go feed the rabbits.
Hey, Gabe.
- Dad.
- Hi, pal. You ready to go?
What do you think?
Oh... Uh...
Well, looks... You know I don't
know anything about art, Gabe.
Hey, let's go home and play some
football, huh? What d'you say?
All right.
Hey there, little rabbit.
Hey there, little bunny.
I just locked up.
You have all your stuff?
Yes, I've
got everything.
I mean, yeah, I
got everything. How you doing?
I'm okay. I just need some
help coming up with ideas,
how to get this place in
better financial shape.
Well, I'll tell you what.
Why don't we talk about it later
and we'll find out if
it's a date or not?
- It's not. And I can't.
I'm busy.
What could be more
important than
talking about fundraising with me
and eating a bucket of chicken?
Our wedding shower.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi, sweetie.
Say, Larry, since
you're free tonight,
why don't you come to
our wedding shower?
You know, Bo, I'd like nothing
more than to go to your shower,
but we're gonna head
down to Gatorland
and sneak in dressed
like a couple of steaks.
- Good.
- Actually, your mother didn't
seem very interested in
inviting any of my friends.
Wait a minute, none of your
friends are gonna be there?
- No.
- All right then,
I think I'll come down there.
- Yeah.
- Wonderful, yeah.
- Okay.
- And, Larry, wear something nice, okay?
- Yeah.
- With sleeves, if you can.
Ladies, I've got to
tell you something.
Have you seen Sue
Ellen's facelift?
I think she should ask her
surgeon for a refund.
Where's the entertainment?
I'm bored.
- Nana, quiet.
- Ah!
Brooke, honey, there's
someone I want you to meet.
Sure, sure.
Who are all these people?
- Potential campaign donors. Big smiles.
- Okay.
Hello.
- How are you?
- Hi.
Hi, I would like to introduce you
to my beautiful fiancée, Brooke.
If you all will excuse me.
- Just one moment, dear?
- Sure.
Yeah, sure.
Wow.
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, what's up?
Hey, a shirt with sleeves, and a tie.
Impressive.
Hey, yeah, look at that.
That's special order, too.
You went all-out, didn't you?
Yeah, here I got that.
Wrapped it myself.
Yeah, thanks.
Tell you what, this is a pretty
nice little shower right here.
Yeah, a bit nicer than
the chicken wings
and Mountain Dew you're
used to, huh, Larry?
What's wrong with Mountain Dew?
I like Mountain Dew.
See, that's why I wanted
you to come tonight.
I wanted you to see that Brooke
has graduated from her old life.
You know, she's moved on to
the finer things in life.
Hey.
Well, you ain't married yet.
I'll be right back.
How you doing?
Pardon me. Excuse me.
How are you? Excuse me.
I had the meatloaf. I'm sorry.
- Hey.
- Hey, where'd Larry go?
I don't know.
He probably went to the kitchen.
Nyx, I know I haven't been
a very good tooth fairy,
but I promise if you'll get me
out of this situation right now,
I will be the best tooth
fairy you've ever seen.
Seriously, Nyx? Now?
Oh, man, this is
not a good time.
There's no way that I am
wearing this outfit...
Whoa!
Oops.
This ain't good.
How's everybody doing tonight?
Hey, wait.
I thought you were here to support me,
not make a joke of my bridal shower.
I'm not making a...
Look, I am here to support you.
You are here in
support hose, Larry!
I am. Oh!
You ain't gonna
believe me, but...
I'm a...
Dancer!
Listen up, everybody.
I hired this gentleman
to dance for us.
After all, this is a
bachelorette party, isn't it?
Now everybody come on,
let's kick this party into gear.
I think I probably
ought to get going.
- I don't think...
- Come on, dance.
Go on, dance for us!
<i>Jungle boogie Jungle boogie.</i>
<i>Oh. my...</i>
<i>Jungle boogie Jungle boogie.</i>
<i>Jungle boogie Jungle boogie.</i>
<i>Jungle boogie Jungle boogie.</i>
Take it off!
Come on, Brooke.
- Oh, no.
- You know you want to.
- No. No, no, no, Larry...
- Come on, surrender to the pink.
No. Larry, no!
<i>Jungle boogie Jungle boogie.</i>
<i>Jungle boogie Jungle boogie.</i>
<i>Jungle boogie Jungle boogie.</i>
<i>Get down Get down.</i>
<i>Get down Get down.</i>
<i>Get down Get down</i>
- Shaw's over, everyone.
It's time for this clown
to go back to the circus.
Good night!
- Bye, Larry. Thanks for coming.
“Ellie Harris, 442.“.
Upstairs? Oh, man.
What am I, The Rock?
Can't get up there.
All right, well, that's
why I got wings.
Let's see what these
babies can do.
One, two, three.
What the heck good are wings
if we can't fly with them?
Well...
I just guess I'll use my
God-given athletic ability.
Hello?
Hey, yeah. Hey, Grandma.
Hog hunting?
I'd love to do it, but I'm
a little busy right now.
Larry?
You're the tooth fairy?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Yeah, I'm the tooth...
Who would ever've
thought that I'd be...
Amnesia powder.
This is powdered sugar.
Oh, for Pete's sake. What...
Oh!
It's the wrong bag.
I know it's in here somewhere.
What in the world did I do with it?
Oh.
There it is.
Larry, can I ask you a question?
Sure, darling. What is it?
Will you make my sister go away?
Will I make your sister...
What're you talking about?
My baby sister.
Mom and Dad spend all
their attention on her.
They don't care
about me any more.
Will you use magic
to make her go away?
Hey, I don't wanna hear
you talk like that.
Your mom and dad still
care about you.
It's just that your little sister's little.
You just wait and see.
You and her, you're
gonna be best friends.
It's gonna be fun.
But right now, she can't even talk.
You know what that means?
You can blame a lot of stuff on her.
Trust me.
I'm the tooth fairy.
Okay, thanks, Larry.
You got it, sport.
Oh, hey, remember,
you never saw the tooth fairy.
We're all set.
Fire it up, Ernie.
- Hey!
- That's it.
Check it out. That's awesome.
Hey, Brooke, check it out.
Look at the hand, moves and everything.
We done all that today.
It looks amazing.
- Don't you like it?
- Yeah.
What's wrong?
Bills, Larry.
I can barely keep this place afloat and
the kids need so many new materials.
I don't know how
I'm gonna do it.
Well, all you gotta do is slap
that thing on eBay I just made,
and make about $50,000.
I wish.
Ms. Miller! Ms. Miller!
Look what I made.
Gabe, that's amazing.
You drew that?
Get out of here. Look at that.
Boy, that ought to be
in a dadgum art museum.
You're a regular artiste.
Wait a second.
Think I just figured out a
way to help this place out.
I like that one.
Me, too.
I think I'm gonna buy it.
Hey, that's nice.
Got any money?
That's awesome.
Gabe.
How you doing, buddy?
Good to see you.
You must be Gabe's dad.
- Frank McGee.
- Frank, I'm Larry.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Did you put my painting up?
Did I put your painting up?
Check out what I done.
Look at this.
Dude, you're the hit
of the whole thing.
Look at all these,
they all sold.
Every one of them gone
in less than 10 minutes.
Really?
Yeah, they sold.
And guess which one I bought.
That one.
That's right, and I'm gonna give
it to her when I see her, too.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go find some of your buddies?
Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.
- He's something else.
- Yes.
I really appreciate what
you're doing for my son.
Oh, he's a great kid.
How do you do it?
I mean, how do you talk
to him about things
like painting and art?
How do you get him
to talk to you?
Shoot, I don't know
nothing about art.
I just kind of encourage him a
little bit, show him that I care.
You know what it means when you're
worried about being a good father?
No.
It means you're a good father.
Thank you.
I better catch up with Gabe.
You got it.
- Nice meeting you.
- Hey, you, too. Good to see you.
- Larry, look at this.
- Hey, Brooke.
- Get out of here.
- Unbelievable.
Not only are we gonna be
able to pay our bills,
but we're actually gonna be
able to buy all-new supplies.
Oh, man, that is awesome.
- I don't know...
- Who's the man? What'd I tell you?
You're the man. Larry,
I gotta admit, I had
my doubts about you.
- But you really...
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, hi.
- I'm sorry I'm late,
but you know those big campaign
donors, they like to talk.
Yeah, so, tell me, how many of these
paintings you need me to buy?
None.
- None?
- We sold every single one.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
That's super.
- I know.
Yeah, let me hold that for you.
- Thank you.
- So which one did you buy?
Well...
Wow, that is...
ls awful.
- No.
- I mean, even for a kid, that's bad.
What's it supposed to be?
What you mean what's
that supposed to be?
What are you, blind?
That's a tooth fairy
battling aloud piglet.
I mean, it ain't
that bad, really.
It's abstract.
Yeah, what she said.
Abstract.
Yeah. Abstract, huh?
"HEY. honey.
- Ready to go?"
Yeah, let's go. I missed you.
Beauregard, you got no
regard for good art.
- Morning!
- Hey.
Well, you're here
bright and early.
We don't open for another hour.
Well, I couldn't
sleep last night.
I got to thinking about this little
building here and it needs work done.
So, I come up to get it fixed.
Look how sturdy I got it now.
Look at that.
Yeah, this from the guy
who once faked a coma
to get out of my
nephew's piano recital?
Well, that was the old Larry.
This is the new, improved, mature Larry.
If I didn't know better, I'd
think this new, mature Larry
was trying to impress me.
How's the new,
mature Larry doing?
Excuse me, new, mature Larry I
have a text from my fiancé.
Boom.
Everything all right?
Yeah, it's fine.
Bo's campaign meeting just got
rescheduled for this afternoon
and we were supposed to go taste
wedding cakes then and that's...
Hold it. Did you just say cake?
Well, it's not a
traditional wedding cake, but...
Look at this. Chocolate.
Orange butter cream frosting.
Kind of balances out. I like it.
A bowling legend
and a cake expert.
- He's quite a catch.
- No, we're not actually engaged. He's just...
- No, she's right.
I am a tremendous catch.
Brooke, you gotta try this.
Oh, my gosh, it's incredible.
You always did like
orange butter cream.
I can't believe you remembered that.
I like that.
I remember anything
that's food-related.
True.
Sorry, I'm late.
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.
Larry is helping me
taste wedding cakes
and we both love this one. Here.
- A chocolate wedding cake?
- Yeah.
You know, how about
something more traditional?
Like this one right here.
- Look.
- Well...
This is divine.
This is wonderful.
Brooke ain't gonna eat that.
She's allergic to strawberries.
Yes, of course.
Darling, can we do this later?
Channel 6 wants to
do a segment on me
and I could really use
your beautiful face.
Oh, well, it's just, I was
planning on buying new supplies.
Hey, I can do it.
Let me do it.
No, no, no, Larry,
you have been great.
More helpful than I could
have ever imagined, you know?
It's just that this is our chance to
give these kids a real rec center.
Yeah, but, Brooke, you're busy,
and I don't mind doing it.
- This is all the money from our fundraiser.
- I can do it.
All right.
Okay, the list is in there.
I am the new, mature Larry.
It will get done.
- See you.
- All right. Bye-bye.
Hey, before I go, though, I
think I'm gonna go down there
and show them uppity folks
how to play some croquet.
- Have fun!
- Knock yourself out.
It's real easy, ladies,
it's all in the form. Fore!
See you!
Get 'er done.
Classic temp mistake.
Do you always have to do that?
You're taking your eye off
the ball, Mr. Guthrie.
What are you talking about?
“Brooke, I love
you ever so much.
“Run away with me.
We'll be ever so happy.“.
- I don't talk like that.
- You're right.
You're way less charming.
You are more like,
“Yeah, babe, don't worry, babe.
"I can totally handle getting
those supplies, babe."
"I can get 'er done.“."
Oh, yeah?
Well, this is what you sound like.
“My name's Nyx,
“and I think I'm the
cutest little fairy...“
My underwear is
creeping up on me.
Whoa! Run along! Just a wedgie.
Ain't no big deal.
Yeah, that's real funny, Nyx.
Yeah, it is.
Stay focused, Mr. Guthrie,
because if you don't get
me some more teeth,
I'll have no choice but to take
away your greatest memory.
Take it easy, I remember.
What is he up to?
He's dancing around like a clown.
Because you have a
case in two minutes.
Just giving you a heads-up,
lest you embarrass
yourself any further.
Focus, focus.
This guy's completely nuts.
Okay, Larry, it's
time to remind Brooke
that you're always
gonna be a loser.
Here we go.
Larry, you're making
this way too easy on me.
Oh, yeah.
If I don't win Tooth Fairy
of the Year for this,
you'll know I got...
Robbed!
Hey, guys, here he is!
Come here, come here, come here!
- There he is! Come here, guys!
- Come on in!
- Come here, he's here!
- Come on in.
Larry! Larry! Larry!
- All right, guys.
- Did you get us a Wii?
- A new telescope?
- More art supplies?
A new puppy?
Where are the supplies?
Everything okay?
I lost the supplies.
- You what?
- I lost the supplies.
I don't know, it's bizarre.
They was in my car.
I went in to get something
real quick in the store,
and I come out, they're gone.
Somebody done stole them!
You're really excited about
your toys that Larry brought?
Yeah!
Can't wait to see them, can you?
- No!
- I know, neither can I.
Just unbelievable.
This was our chance to give
these kids a real rec center
and you blow it on one
of your pit stops?
What was it this time, Larry?
It was important.
You know, Larry, since you
have come back into my life,
I have had to clean up one major
mess of yours after another.
All right, Brooke, listen.
I'm gonna tell you, okay?
You're not gonna believe me,
but I'm gonna tell you.
I'm just gonna be honest.
All right?
I'm a tooth fairy.
I mean, not the Tooth Fairy.
I'm a tooth fairy.
It's really weird.
They got it regionalized now.
Who'd have thought they'd
have regionalized that?
But that's howl lost the stuff.
I go in to get this tooth from this kid...
A joke. You're gonna make a joke
- at a time like this.
- I ain't making a...
You really can't take
anything seriously, can you?
I ain't making a joke.
I go in to get this tooth...
God, I can't believe I actually
thought you had changed.
It is so clear you are
never gonna grow up.
Brooke, I ain't kidding...
Oh, boy.
The kids are starting to worry.
Did something happen to
the supplies, Larry?
Oh, Larry, come on, man.
What are we gonna tell the kids?
Well, why don't we
just tell them that...
Nothing.
I can't let these kids suffer
because of someone else's idiocy.
You know, I'm gonna personally cover
the expenses to all new supplies.
In fact, I'm gonna go
buy them right now.
Let me do something.
Let me make up for what I done.
Haven't you done enough?
So, I know you're a little
slow on the uptake,
but when you sprout wings and
a pair of pink coveralls,
- that means you're a tooth fairy.
You do have some teeth
to collect tonight.
I quit.
Grow up. So you've had a
couple of bad breaks.
Bad breaks, seriously?
Let me tell you something
about bad breaks.
If it wasn't for me having to
collect all them teeth for you,
none of this would've
happened to me.
Now, Brooke's mad at me.
She hates my guts.
She's gonna marry
Beauregard Billings.
I mean, guess what
I get out of it.
The rest of my life to
try to forget about her.
Thanks a lot.
You ruined my life.
I ruined your life?
Take a second and remember what
your life was before we met.
Because the way I remember it, you were
a big fat washout going nowhere fast.
Well, there, see?
Something hasn't changed.
Look, two days ago, I would've
encouraged you to quit.
But I was wrong.
You're actually not
horrible at this.
So just collect six
more teeth by Sunday
and you save your
greatest memory.
You know what?
Take it. I could careless.
Go ahead and just take it.
Metro County Miracle. Who cares?
To think I actually started
to believe in you.
Have a
nice life, Mr. Guthrie.
Wait.
I don't believe it.
Larry opened the garage early again?
That's crazy.
Did you stay up again all night?
Man, I appreciate your new work
ethic, but this is too much.
Yeah, man, you're
going overboard.
Well, I feel like this is
what I need to do now.
For what it's worth, I think
she's marrying the wrong guy.
Thanks.
<i>Hey, this is Tom
Abrams calling for Larry Guthrie.</i>
<i>I'm on the Central
Florida Bowling Team,</i>
<i>and me and some of the guys were
trying to recreate your crazy roll.</i>
<i>And we were hoping maybe you could come
on by and show us how you did it.</i>
<i>Give me a call, 555-8621.
Thanks again.</i>
What do you say, Larry?
Wanna show these young'uns
a thing or two?
About what?
About the Metro
County Miracle, man.
Come on, go and drop some
knowledge on those kids.
Knowledge.
You want them to have knowledge,
tell them to go buy
some nacho cheese.
'Cause that's what I tripped
on when I made that shot.
I mean, pure luck.
Metro County Miracle.
Wait a minute.
I still remember that.
That's not my best memory.
Hey, hold on, I
gotta do something.
Where you going?
- How's it going? What's going on?
- Hey, Larry.
Hey, can we have a word?
I love you, but I'm in a hurry.
We'll do it next time.
Please, it's really important.
Uh...
So what's on y'all's minds?
I lost that tooth.
Oh.
And I remember what
you said before.
But then you told
all those stories.
Now, I don't know
what to believe.
So, please, just
tell me the truth.
If I put my tooth
under my pillow,
will the tooth fairy
come, or not?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
I was a tooth fairy, remember?
What do you want?
I want my job back.
What's the point?
You only have two days
to collect six teeth.
I mean, even if you
collect one tonight,
there aren't five cases
scheduled for tomorrow.
You can't possibly meet your quota.
It's hopeless.
Nyx, listen.
But if there's a chance
to have Gabe believe in
the tooth fairy again,
I'm gonna take that chance.
And it has nothing to do
with my greatest memory.
Come on, Nyx, it's the
right thing to do.
Please?
- Very well.
- Thank you.
I can't believe I actually
asked to be back in these.
Hey, you know what?
Now that I know the
Metro County Miracle's
not my greatest memory,
you think maybe
you could kind of
tell me what it was?
Tell you what,
you get me Gabe's tooth
and your best memory will appear
on the back of the case card
in your pouch.
I'll be in and out of there so fast,
they won't even know I was there.
Kind of like college.
Okay, Gabe, let's
go get your tooth.
I knew it! I knew it!
I thought we were friends.
- Gabe!
- He's the tooth fairy.
What's going on here?
Wow.
I can't believe these are real.
Are you all done
poking at me now?
For Pete's sake, you act like you ain't
never seen a tooth fairy before.
- They're making you collect teeth?
- Yeah, they are.
And my sentence ends tomorrow at
midnight, and I'm five teeth short.
Well, what happens if you
don't get all the teeth?
Then I lose my best memory.
Forever.
Your best memory? What is it?
I don't know.
You know what? Let's find out.
It's probably something silly
about the first time I ate
a Slim Jim or something.
Or bacon. I love bacon.
I guarantee it has something
to do with bacon.
Oh, man, I gotta
get this one back.
Just collect five more teeth.
I can't.
There's no more cases tomorrow.
- There could be.
- What do you mean?
You got me to believe in
the tooth fairy again.
So, just do that
five more times.
Good idea.
Check it out.
<i>Life is good when you're around.</i>
<i>Nothing can bring me down.</i>
<i>I can't believe
what I have found.</i>
We're ready.
Oh, man!
Thanks, guys, for everything.
Good luck, Larry.
I hate to do this, but
it's tooth fairy rules.
Remember, you never
saw the tooth fairy.
“Invitation from
the tooth fairy.“
“You have stopped
believing in me.“
"I hereby give you one last chance
to make up for your mistake.“"
“Tonight and only tonight...“
"I will collect any tooth you
put under your pillow.“."
Hey, did you get one
of these invitations?
Luckily, my mom saved
this old baby tooth.
I'm gonna go for it.
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
I got one last baby tooth, so...
What do I gotta lose?
- Ow!
Now, I don't know
how you did it,
but somehow you convinced five kids
to believe in the tooth fairy again.
Now, no temp or tooth fairy has ever
collected five teeth in one night.
Well, I might be the first one.
This was my secret weapon back
when I was a tooth fairy.
Speed of the hummingbird.
We're not technically supposed to give
it to temps because it's so rare,
but it sure would be a shame
if someone left this box open.
So, why, do they dry out or something
if you leave the box open?
Are you messing with me?
Yeah, little bit.
This is awesome, and I
really appreciate it.
We're almost like a team now,
like Starsky and Hutch or...
What do you want, a
hug or something?
You know what?
A hug, actually, would be kind of...
Jean, is Brooke here?
My sister's busy, and she
doesn't wanna see you.
Jean... Hey, please?
Come on, all I wanna do is talk to
her, just for a second. Please?
<i>I'll see.</i>
- You know, Larry is here.
- All right.
Whoa.
Brooke.
You look beautiful. Look at you.
Thanks.
- This isn't really a great time, Larry.
- I know. I know it's not.
But I just had to come by
and tell you something.
Can I talk to you
just for a second?
You remember that time that
you and I went fishing?
This was our second date.
And we were walking back,
and you took my hand and
put it in your hand.
Well, I got to thinking
about that the other day,
and that was, by far, the greatest
all-time memory of my life.
The single best memory.
And at the time, I just
couldn't figure out
why somebody so sweet
and kind and smart
could like me like that.
Larry...
Look, I know it sounds corny,
Brooke, I really do.
And if you don't wanna be with me,
if you wanna be with somebody else,
I get it.
You gave me tons of chances.
But you deserve to be with somebody
whose greatest memory is about you.
Well, I guess what I'm
trying to say here is...
I'm trying to object
to the wedding,
in case you ain't figured
out what I'm trying to do.
Yeah, I got it.
See? Beautiful and smart.
Well, all right.
Well, I said my piece.
Boy, I sure appreciate
you doing this.
I mean, I didn't have
anywhere else to turn.
But I promise to get
you home by midnight.
Hey, and if you do a good job, you
can have all the moon pies you want.
- How's that?
Well, I'm getting hungry.
You wanna
stop and get a BLT?
Oh, sorry.
You wanna stop and get an LT?
Artistry's
moisture-intense mask.
It's like having your face drink
from the Fountain of Youth, ladies.
Your face is gonna feel as if
it's plumping from within.
And just being
beautiful and radiant,
and vibrant and glowing.
Do you feel that, ladies?
All this can be yours.
And it's only $20.65.
Ooh!
All right, well, I do have
another surprise for you.
Have you ever heard that expression,
“You can put lipstick on a pig?“.
Well, with Artistry's rouge,
you can literally put
lipstick on a pig
and that pig will turn heads.
I'm not kidding.
Come on, Crusher! Stacey!
See you later, little buddy.
I appreciate the help. And wish me luck.
By the way, enjoy the moon pies!
They're delicious.
Sometimes we just have to make
a few sacrifices in life, huh?
I mean, of course, I
miss the Ferrari.
But if driving a pickup truck.
and
talking like this gets me elected,
well, that's just
gander 'n grits, huh?
- Bo?
- Yeah.
Could I talk to
you for a second?
Yeah. Excuse me, fellas.
Honey, hey, hey,
I can't talk right now.
Now, listen. These guys can really
help my chances of getting elected.
I know, it's just...
I need to ask you something.
What is your greatest memory?
- What?
- No, please, it's important.
- What is your single greatest memory?
- I don't know.
Throwing the game-winning touchdown
against Eastland to win State.
I'll tell you, people are
still talking about it.
These guys are talking about it.
That throw was right
down the middle.
That was something else, yeah.
So, honey, why was
that so important?
All right, Reilly. Where you at?
206. 206. Got you!
I am running out of time.
I gotta get four more teeth.
Ha! Speed of a hummingbird.
Boy, this better work.
Man, I feel
like I'm on Fear Factor.
Wait for it. Wait for it.
All right.
Looks like I got a
need for some speed.
Those smell amazing.
Curbs, schmarbs.
Weird.
Dadgum, five teeth.
I'm ahead of schedule. I'm good.
What's going on?
No, it's wearing off.
I've gotta get
back to the house!
Just gonna make it.
Oh, man. What is he doing here?
It's about time you showed up!
Not now. As you can tell, I'm
in the middle of something.
- I'm doing some fairying.
- Hey, you ruined my wedding.
And then you try
to big league me?
- I ruined your wedding?
- Yeah, idiot.
Brooke called off the
wedding because of you.
What? How'd I do that?
She wants to be with someone
whose best memory is of her.
And apparently that
someone is you!
You cost me the election.
Now it's time for payback...
She wants to be with me.
- She loves me. She loves me!
Ooh.
Mv bad!
Larry, I won't forget about
this, you son of a...
Now you will.
Oh, man. Time to save that memory.
Whoa! Brake! Brakes!
Cutting it a little close
there, aren't you?
Well.
Just keeping it interesting.
Well, mission accomplished,
in every sense.
And now that you've
met your quota,
I hereby restore your
greatest memory.
Thanks.
You ever need a temporary tooth fairy at
some point in time, give me a holler.
You know, I might just
take you up on that.
I'm gonna miss you, kid.
Oh, sorry, I mean old lady.
I guess it's time
to redecorate now.
No, not again.
Jackpot!
Thank you, Nyx.
<i>Brown has it,
drops back, fakes to Wilson.</i>
<i>Hits Terry over the middle.
That's for a quick gain of four yards.</i>
- Oh, oh, oh. 40, 30, 20,10...
- Yeah, come on! Come on!
Here's some dip for you boys,
and I'll get you some
chili in a second, okay?
Honey, let me get
that chili for you.
You don't need to be walking.
Look at you. Look at that, boys.
There's the next football
star, right there.
Hey, you still having the
cravings for moon pies?
Actually, I have this crazy
hankering for sardines right now.
Sardines? Sardines?
Sardines?
Let me run and get you some.
Honey, you don't have
to go right now.
No, relax.
It'll just take a second.
Keep watching.
I'll be right back.
Tell me what happens.
Look, I know I offered to help
you if you ever needed me,
but five minutes before halftime?
You gotta be joking.
The regional tooth fairy called in
sick, so I need someone to fill in.
The regional tooth fairy called in sick.
He never does any work.
Can it wait
till after the game?
Evidently that means no.
Tell you what.
You get this tooth, and I won't mess with
you for the rest of football season.
Yeah, I'll believe that
when I see pigs fly.
Funny you should say that.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, I didn't
expect to see that.
I thought you could use a little help.
Actually, all the help you could get.
Well, Crusher, you hear that?
Looks like you and me's partners.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go get me that tooth.
Hey, Crusher, we're like a superhero
team now flying around up here.
"We can call ourselves
“Fat Man and Hoggin'."
- All right, never mind.
