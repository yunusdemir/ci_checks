Kuala Lumpur
Many, many years ago...
Sorry
There are special instructions
from lntelligence
...that everybody should undergo
a security screening
Please, this is an emergency
She is Dr. Susan's patient
Alright
- Mr. Alphonse
- Yes?
Come
Congratulations!
Twin babies, boys
Thank you!
Ah! Congrats!
l'll go and buy some sweets
Sorry
l'm sorry
- What's happening?
- l don't know
Doctor
You go downstairs quickly, go
l will come with Mary
Go
Come here for a minute
What is it?
What?
l think one of the babies
has been exchanged
Alphonse!
COBRA
Today
Aiyo!
Hey, there goes my dhoti
Who is that vagabond?
Sh! Quiet! Don't you
recognize that speed?
That's cobra's vehicle
Cobra?
Who is he?
Not he, them
There are 2 of them
Kottayam Brothers, 'Ko-br'
What! Come again?
The 'Ko' from Kottayam
and 'Br' from brothers
...they became 'co-bra'
But how can brothers have a bra
That's for sisters, isn't it?
This is not that 'bra'
The loop under 'b' to
pronounce 'br' in malayalam
Oh! That bra
We call it the loin cloth!!
Rascals! Going around without
dhoti and loin cloth!
Look, Lawrence 'chetta'
The ferry is coming in
'Chetta' give me tea
Diwakara, whose is that
swanky car in the ferry?
- Belongs to the cobras
- Who?
The cobras
That's what l was told
They are from Kottayam
They've not yet
decided where to go
Either to Coimbatore
or to Kozhikode
They stay only in those places
which begin with 'Ko'
- Why?
- To match their name cobra
Hmmm...look at them
speeding towards a 'Ko'
Come to me, buddy
l too have a 'Ko' with me
Oh God! l think
they heard you
What? From so far away?
Being snakes, their sense
of hearing is powerful
Are these the cobras
you mentioned?
They look more like
worthless paper snakes
- ls coffee available?
- Yes
- Then serve us strong tea
- Okay
- Curry?
- Yes
Then first you scrape
away the curry(soot)
Wash well and
then get us tea
By the way, l hope you
have recognized us
-Are you the cobra...?
- lt's not cobra, Gobra
Our names begin
with 'Go' and 'Bra'
This is Gopalan
and l am Bralan
Bralan? What sort
of a name is that?
The actual name is Balan
Just for a change, Bralan
Remember? The song,
'vethyasthanam Balan'...?
We are the original cobras
Securities and P.R.O
These cobras do not like
to blow their own trumpets
So they pay us a salary
And get us to talk
about their deeds
Oh just like Panan the poet
sang ballads about the valor of
...legendary warriors
of Puthuran veedu
Panan used to walk
around and sing
We fly around in the alc car and sing
That is why they've given us
this car worth nearly a million rupees
Paid up road tax
and insurance also
lf you guys have a car like this
what would the cobras have?
No chance!
They never travel in alc cars
They throw up
No! Humility!
Ultimate humility
That is 'cobras'
ls this some poetic story narration
for you to beat the cymbal?
Oh! lt wasjust
a sudden enthusiasm
Ah! There's no need for
such enthusiasm, okay?
Friends!
Oh goodness! My throat too
seems to be afflicted
Don't bother about that
We are enjoying
the narration, isn't it?
- Gobran, continue with your story
- Come on, tell
Go on...
lt's very interesting
True, l have always known...
...there was an actor
sleeping within me
Why do you say that?
Many times there's a snore
from within my abdomen
- That's only flatulence!
- Bralan!
Your comments
are crossing limits
Sir, please continue
Okay
Now look there
Hello! Here
This is where you must look
ln poetic story narrations, look there
actually means to look here
This is the most
beautiful city of Delhi
This is where we see
the faces of our cobra
...forthe very 1st time
But cobras stay only in places
beginning with 'Ko'
Where is 'ko' in Delhi?
Who says there is no 'ko' in Delhi?
Delhi has its own 'ko'
That's the one
in the heart of the city
Cradled in natural beauty,
'Connate place'
lt is Connaught place
Hey Buji! lt's just a matter
of lengthening a vowel, isn't it?
Excuse that mistake
Go on, you continue
Yes, Connaught place
And l am taking you to
this Connaught place
Come, let's go on a tour
Aiyo! l am not coming
l must go to school
- Go away, kid
- You get lost
You continue, dude
Connaught Place
Those days they were
the Connaught Brothers
The ones who knew the secret
tricks and trade of the city
Cobra
This is King Cobra
(Rajavembala)
We can call him Raja
This is the Black cobra
(Karimoorkan)
We can call this
dark fellow Kari
- Brother...blood!
- What?
Blood!
Stop! Stop!
Hey! He's the winner
Winner!
Blood in turn for
my brother's blood
Murder for murder!
Death-frenzy!
Thank you
Oh! l'm so tired
Hey! Get me
a soda with fizz
Are these cobras
really brothers?
That's what they claim, twins
But since we are all blessed
with some normal intelligence
...we know it is highly unlikely
Would a milk chocolate and dark chocolate
be made in the same mould?
- What the hell?!
- Soda
- Give it here
- Scat!
Are these cobras married?
lt was one of their most
intense desires to get married
- Once upon a time...
- Hey, don't start the story yet
- Hey soda?
- Yes?
Do you know
how to use a cymbal?
Of course!
These cobras did not have any conditions
about how their future brides should be
They never insisted on not
being gifted a heavy dowry
They never insisted the girl
shouldn't be very beautiful
They weren't particular the girls
should have buck teeth
But they insisted
only on 1 condition
- Only 1 condition!
- What was that?
The girls should be siblings
Why did they want that?
To give more power,
weight and punch
...to the name cobra
What?
- You didn't understand, right?
- No
lf they married siblings
what would their relationship be?
What will it be?
- Cobres
- Chey!
Not cobres
Co-brothers!
- Darn good cymbal!
- Thank you
Yes, now cobra
has a deeper meaning
That was how much
they loved that name
See! lt's the truth
Did you hearthe lizard twitter?
That was me
Oh it was a dog
that twittered
Dirty fellow!
Did these cobras finally
get their sibling brides?
They did!
ln fact, many times
As the proposals reached
to almost being finalized...
...we all know, what these
Malayalis around them do
They spread rumors
about the cobras
That they were trouble makers,
wrestlers, good-for-nothing etc., etc...
So all alliances broke off
Finally one came through
Well matched and with
all conditions fulfilled
2 sisters
A week before they tied
the knot in the church...
...to avoid any kind of hitches
they even registered their marriages
The day finally arrived
safe with all precautions
The day cobras wedded
The day cobras
became co-brothers
That beautiful day dawned
They became
Kothamangalam brothers
Kothamangalam
St Nicholas Church
Bro, we don't have any relations
from our side of the family
Bro, why do we need relatives?
You are my relative
and l am yours
- Poison is never needed in large measures
- So you think just 2 of us suffice?
You can start walking, sir
Come
Bro, do we have only
this flower shower?
Shouldn't we have arranged
for Punjabi melam?
- Band with drums, etc
- Oh! You mean Panjara melam?
Ah yes! Only then
will it look good on T.V
Okay, we'll see
what can be done
Hey you! Come here
Did you coverthis
in slow motion?
- No
- Oh! What a pity
- Do you really want all that, sir?
- Of course we do, dude
Only then will it be
like college life
You do what l say
Record it once again
Come
Now take it and see
that it's in slow motion
And look, in slow motion
it should be slow like this...
...then speed up
like this alternately
That's the fashion these days
l'll create all those later on
You just walk now
Okay, now take
Look they've arrived
Brother, your Rosy looks good
All dressed and decked up
But where ls your girl?
Where is your bride, Gracie?
Hey!
- Where is my brother's bride, Gracie?
- That's what l've come to tell you about
The 2 brides started out
from their homes together
- Who?
- The brides
This bride with her parents in one car
The other, in a 2nd car with herfriends
And nothing, except that only
1 car has reached here
We have no clue
where the other bride went
Bralan has gone in search
- What the heck is this?
- Bro, don't get upset
Sister probably went
for some tuition
Why, is she facing a math exam
to go for tuition?
- Just wait she'll be here soon
- What's there to wait?
l have waited so long
Bro, we are getting older
Yes, time has gone away!
- Sir?
- What is it?
- lt's a matter of urgency
- What is it, dude?
Please come with me
lt's pretty urgent
What?
Tell us what happened?
That girl was in love
with someone it seems
- You vagabond, nonsense!
- Wait, let me ask
What's all this, dude?
She's not in love with me
So why did you hit me?
There must be someone else
They have eloped
Who told you this news?
No one told me
l simply assumed it could be so
You assume nonsense
like this, is it? You dog!
Calm down
There's something
in what he says
l too felt this
l kept quiet to avoid
the blows, that's all
Now that the beating session is over
this is obviously what has happened
Brother!
Sir?
What is this?
- Hey brother, don't be like this
- Everything is gone
- Where the heck are you going?
- l am going to sit right here
Now where will l sit?
lt's nothing brother
- We'll get another girl
- When and where?
We will get
We will
- When in heavens will it happen!?
- When...if you ask me...?
We'll definitely get 1
Don't be upset
Bro, our age is increasing
Even if it does,
how much can it increase?
That's true
Sir! Please smile a bit
What kind of a smile is this?
- Sir, why don't you smile a bit?
- Get lost! You pig
What the heck is this?
You just go away
l'll explain everything
Brother?
Eh?
Please say something and...
Look, there is no use
expecting that girl any more
Everybody says at least
let 1 of the weddings be conducted
We have to be quick
Father has to leave for a funeral
- Not necessary
- Then the corpse will decay
l did not mean that, you corpse!
Listen, there's an announcement
This wedding is cancelled
There is no need to
perform 1 wedding alone
We had decided
we'd get married together
Now that 1 is broken off
we don't want the other also
Sir, this is going to affect
the future of that young girl
No, the future and past of anyone
is not my concern
My brother is most important to me
Everything else comes after that
Please don't jump and
take such a decision
Whether we jump or notjump
you be quiet
lf this wedding is called off
it means it is cancelled!
This is my brother's decision
That's all
What do you say, bro?
Bro? Don't we mean 'that's all'?
Then come, lets go
Ah! Look the other
bride has come!
Where were you?
Please forgive us
She went to see an old teacher
to get her blessings
Teacher suddenly turned seriously ill
We admitted her in a hospital and came
- So sweet!
- She scared us all!
- Now let's not waste time
- Father has to leave for the funeral
l should have waited
for awhile at least
You mean, the corpse?
Of course it can wait
No, l made to face so many
accusations and decisions
Oh, that's okay
Anybody else would say the same
- Yes
- You come now
Hello
Did the teacher die?
Oh l see she didn't, sorry!
Teachers died
when l was young, too
Today you, tomorrow you...
- Father, son and the holy ghost...
- Come my dear, lets go
l don't want this
wedding to take place
Will this turn into a fiasco?
What are you saying, my dear?.
l said l don't want to
l don't agree
to this marriage
He says his brother
is everything to him
He said my future
didn't matter to him
l don't want a blasted life
with such a man
Sorry, you don't worry
Let me talk to her
Thoma'cha
No
She has a valid point
What he said
was a little too much
Brother, friends...are all good enough
But the relationship
between a husband and wife
...is so precious and strong
Since so much has happened
let us stall this wedding
Talk to the girl
Get her acceptance
Afterthat we'll go ahead with it
Forthe time being
let this wedding take place
What's this, bro?
Well...since Father says
to go ahead with this...
No
We are not conducting
1 wedding alone
- What do you say?
- But...
There are no buts
Father, the weddings
stand cancelled
You go take care
of the funeral
Otherwise this will also
start stinking like this
Come, bro
- Brother!
- Br...br...brothere
My age...?
COBRA VlHARAC
Alsatian Dogs
Beware!
Bro, come let's eat
Go and try
Look here, Kari sir
What's the point
in being upset like this?
This is not the last girl
on earth, is she?
lt may be a fact
...that you are more than a little dark
slightly in poor shape with all that booze
That doesn't mean, you'll never
find some girl who's willing
l'll kill you!
You pig!
l may say, l have
no color and glamour
But if someone else says it
l'll stab and take his intestines out
Vagabond!
Oh, now l am satisfied
- Mmm?
- l decided to stop
- Kari sir
- Eh?
Raja sir
You come and eat
lt's of no use brooding
Kari sir has neither
looks nor brains
You dare talk rubbish
about my brother?.!
l'll kick and
mash you to pulp!
Get up and
get lost, you...!
- What happened?
- l too stopped
- Both of you can leave
- Come, lets go
Bro, come and eat
l am not hungry
But l am hungry
Then you go eat
No one need wait for me
Let me be alone
Yes, its true
lt was wrong
but it happened
l had a dream that we'll get
married on the same day
And walk into this house
with our brides together
lf that dream was a mistake
you'll just have to forgive me, bro
- Look here?
- lt's not that
l will go talk to them
They will agree
lf not l will force them to agree
And if they still don't
l'll fall at their feet
Hey! What are you saying?
l will conduct it for sure
Even if l have to fall
at any donkey's feet
Otherwise what is the use of
calling myself your brother?.
Look, l have called only you 'bro'
Don't make me swear at you
What the hell are you saying?
Falling at someone's feet?
Beg forgiveness?
For what?
Ask them to get lost
My brother is most
important to me
Just because l blabber...
But don't you want to marry?
For what?
One at least?
l've got better work to do
Aren't you hungry?
- We are also hungry
- Then go lay the table
Come
Even though they were cobras
...at times they had the mentality
of harmless water-snakes
lf a water snake bites
we have to miss dinner (proverb)
Why do say such
unrelated things here?
lt was just a connecting
train of thought
Now where are those children?
What children?
Children come only
when a couple gets married
He's not meaning cobras' kids
He's enquiring about
the cobras themselves
Oh them!
After that incident
they just nipped it away
l meant the thought of marriage!
Not only that, after that disgrace
they ended their stay in that town
Hereafter, it's Coimbatore
Coimbatore brothers
We have to find a new house there
and a new business to set up
The 1st step towards that is
this journey we are undertaking
Ask them not to worry
Tell them they will get
2 girls, beautiful and gorgeous
Ah! This is an omen that the girls
will be truly stunning like lightning
lf there's lightning,
you can bet
...there'll be wind and
turbulence right behind!
John Samuel and his children
Judge grandpa, if you
have an opinion, say it
You've been drooling for quite some time
over the photos of those girls
l am not drooling, lsaac
Spinning...l'm spinning a web
What do you guys want now?
As the executor of Samuel hospital,
which has come up for auction...
...inviting bid for lease, l should
make sure you guys get it
For this, you want to know
...who your opponents
who've registered are, isn't it?
Yes
l will tell you
But only if l get this...
There isn't anyone
who's a threat opposing you
Only 1 person has registered
John Samuel
Who?
Him?
But, he's totally broke
and down in the dumps
Shouldn't he have money
to bid for the auction?
That's why l said
Superficially, there are
no contenders
But don't take it lightly
They can arrange for the money
seconds before the auction
There's plenty of time
What does he have
with him to sell?
Only that house
No one will buy that place
ln case someone comes
they won't buy it
We have manipulated such
that no one will buy it
But the planets are aligned
completely in favor of John Samuel
Grandpa, you need not
prophesy astrologically
Just let us know
the legal aspects
Who am l to talk legal matters?
These are just out of routine habit
Why am l a small
unimportant lawyer...
...called judge grandpa
by all, including you?
John Samuel will get money
That too his girls
will be the reason
Money is coming in
from the North...loads!
Be careful
Jesus
Take care of us
What happened to those people
intending to buy the house?
There is some
game going on, sir
They just say they are coming...
Go and see who it is
Oh...it's you?
Please sit
lt's true that we had
a slight altercation
...regarding the hospital auction
We made some
unnecessary comments
Please forget all that
We don't know if you are
taking part in this auction
lf so why compete?
Why don't we join hands in this?
How is it possible, dude?
Can a fox and a monkey
share a business deal?
Sorry
l meant myself
when l said monkey
l am a little stubborn
Pig headed, that's me
Okay let's not share
the business or deal
Why not life?
We've come to tell you that too
We would like to marry your girls
This alliance is a big strength
Both for you as well as for us
No, l am not for it
You can do as you please
But leave me alone
And my girls too
Sir...
Please
Goodnight
Sir, are you taking
part in the auction?
How can l?
Not that l don't want to
But it won't work out
Don't we need money for that?
lt will come
Money will come
Brother, stop please
Oh, where is the break?
What is it, bro?
Why not some tea?
2 strong tea
One, a bit light
Don't make that too light
Just a little less strong
Yeah, yeah
1 strong tea that's light
And 1 light tea that's strong
How far is it to
Coimbatore from here?
By car or by bus?
By jeep
lf it's by jeep about 50 km
Oh!
And by car?.
lt'll be more
Around 60 km
Oh good! We came
by jeep, right, bro?
Right!
Don't go
Please wait
Hey! Don't go
Stop the bus
Bro, where are you going?
Hey stop!
Hey! Stop the vehicle
Stop, l say
Stop the vehicle, l say
What is it?
Get out of my way, vagabond
Yes dude, that's it
What?
What's it, buddy?
No...no...
Wrong person
l am not who
you thought l was
ls he nuts?
Chey!
Sorry!
Making fools of us
Get going, right!
What was the issue, bro?
l mistook him for someone else
Haven't you given up
even after so many years?
Don't you have
anything better to do?
Oh be quiet, bro!
- How much?
- Rs 10
Where are you going now?
- To pay for the tea
- No, l'll pay for it
No, it is alright, l'll pay
l insisted on drinking tea
So l'll pay for it
Well...l ordered the tea
So l'll pay for it
- Hey don't make this an issue
- You don't make this an issue
lt's a question of my insult
l'm sure you
meant self-respect?
Who are you to say that?
You don't have to interfere in
issues between us brothers, okay?
What's it, bro?
You want to pay, right?
You are so stubborn
Go ahead and pay
Are you upset?
No
Take
- Only Rs 10?
- That's what you said
That was forthe tea
Who's going to pay
for wrecking this shop?
How much will that cost?
That will be 10...
l mean Rs 3500
That brother will pay
What?
Why Me?
- Well! You started the issue
- But you blew it up
l won't pay
- Won't you?
- No
- Won't you?
- No, l won't
No?
Okay, okay
But forthe next problem
you'll have to pay
- Sure?
- Sure!
Oh well! All these
are ego hassles
- Wasn't what l said correct?
- Undoubtedly! lt's the absolute truth!
One, two, three, four
Quite good
Splendid agricultural work
- What does that mean?
- Vaastuhaara
- What?
- Carpentry, my dear bro
We can blindly give
4 crore, isn't it bro?
lf we give blindly, we'll go
wrong in calculations, bro
That's not what l meant, bro
Can we give 4 crore for this?
- lt's a loss even if we pay 5 crore
- What? A Loss?
...to the owner
Bro, how would it look
in a bright red coat of paint?
- lt will be too simple
- ls it?
Suppose we paint
the windows a bright yellow?
That's a good idea
They have aristocratic lineage
Oh, that doesn't matter
They are giving it off
out of desperation
Desperation and difficulties
should be a must in the world
When we landed up
with riches and cars
...every other vagabond
too has prized possessions
- That is not fair, bro
- Yes, global recession
What?
Samathalathanduldhavastha!
(global recession)
John sir, they have come
Ah! Come in
Who is that?
That is John Samuel, sir
House ownership
Meaning?
The captain of
this sinking ship
Oh! Sinking ship
What's the difference between
a ship and a sinking ship?
They first build a ship
Then they float it in water
lf it goes under
it is a sinking ship
lf it floats
it is a floating ship
Correct
l asked to know
if you knew
- Oh God!
- You are so well informed
l was asked to conduct a show
Ashwamedham for Kairali TV
l did not go
l have better things to do
- Really?
- Really!
For example think
of your name!
- ls it an lndian name?
- Yes
- Male
- Yes
-Alive
- Yes
The movie which brought Kerala
to international levels
lf you dive into the history
of Malayalam cinema...
The first talkie
lf anyone asks us
we will say your name
Yes
That is Balan
Correct!
Truly, you are a genius
Dining
Bro, how is it?
Very much...not bad
This is the room
where for the 1st time
...Sir had breakfast with his wife
Oh l see, it is used
Dude, show them
the other rooms
This is the guest bedroom
This is the room where...
Stop! Stop!
Didn't this sir's wife do anything finally
instead of all first times?
Yes, she did
Look at that fan
That is where she hung
and died for the last time
Oh dead end!
Where is the toilet?
Sherin committed suicide
She had mental
hallucinations
- Oh, l see
- Meaning?
A kind of madness in the mind
Many stories went around
That l'd killed her
and hung her there
That there were ghosts here
l am not hiding anything
Please think over it carefully
- These ghosts...?
- No
Okay, it's quite good
The house even
if its old is good
...the land is also okay
The house, land, ghosts
and everything else
Tell me honestly,
what should l pay?
About the price...
what shall l say?
Okay, we will fix it
Totally we'll fix it for 2
2 crores, Kaun Banega
crorepathi (TV show)
- l won't say price is less
- Didn't l tell you?
But my need is 3 crores
Also 6 months for my children
to complete their course
- For that period...
- Then you needn't stop with that
Till they complete their course,
arthritic problem you might face
...the medical expenses it might incur
and the expenses of...
...the entire work force of this place
we shall bear, what about it?
This is just like
bro's earlier comment
- What was that word?
- Recession!
Yes, that is it!
Wait!
Let's do something
- Let's fix it for 2.5
- Why, bro?
Let it be, poor guy
Think it over and decide
Let uncle decide
Are you packing?
l told you to call us
only if it was a favorable deal
Wasted efforts!
His ridiculous price
And to top it,
a basketful of liabilities
Leave it sir, he's educating
his 2 children to become doctors
Let him, we have no objection
But why should we suffer for it?
Suppose we are
afflicted by piles...
...will these moron doctors
treat us free of cost?
Hmmm...assistant?
They may not but
those girls definitely will
Girls? Who are they?
l did not mean
some vague girls
l meant seeing them
your eyes will pop out
See, your eyes
popped out
- Who are they?
- Yes, who indeed?
- Who are they, dude?
- Who is it?
You idiot!
Tell me who they are
Annie and Shirley
- Who are they?
- Who are they?
- Who are they, dude?
- Yes, who are they?
Tell us
Annie and Shirley
Who are they...is
what we are asking
Mr John Samuel's girls
They are ladies!
Studying medicine in Bangalore
They are Mr John Samuel's daughters
What do you think?
Valuable assets, aren't they?
But he's not selling them
lt's only the house that's on sale
Of course the deal is on the house
But it is to educate these poor girls
That poor man is selling
that poor looking house
Since it's only after
that poor man sells
...that poor house, he can
educate those poor girls
And finally get them married off
Then why can't you
buy the poor man's house?
So that he educates those poor girls
And then get those poor girls
...to marry you poorfellows?
Come again?
Look, they are 2 of them
grown up together
With similar education
and resemblance too
lt is God who has guided you
to this place for your marriage
...on the same day
at the same venue
'That will end the cows itch
and appease the crows hunger'
What do you say?
But for that...
Which one?
You can choose
whomever you want
No arguments
Both are good, aren't they?
But shouldn't MrJohn agree?
He will agree
ln a sense
they are also like you
You mean they drink?
No, not that
They are also finding it difficult
to get good marriage proposals
Mother was insane and she hung herself
This's the reason fortheir single status
Poor girls
Grieving father
Not only, he's quite
fed up with 2 rowdies
...harassing him to get
the girls married to them
Forget the father
Shouldn't the girls like us?
How can they not like you
Sir, your case does not
have any problem
But this sir...
What is lacking in me,
you vagabond?
Nothing lacking
Just a black moustache,
black hair, black...
Let me see it
What is wrong with you?
Bro, what do say?
Nothing doing!
He's trying to sell his house
He won't have any money with him
Why should he have money?
We have more
than enough, don't we?
lt's not that
Are they too short?
Why do they need to be tall?
Both of us have enough height
But l feel they are
a bit too young
Oh! That's not a problem
They may be just about
10 years younger
After 5 years it will reduce
to 5 years, isn't it?
- That's not a problem
- That's true
After 10 years
we will be same age
- Yes
- Then, it's okay
So after 20 years will these kids
be 10 years older than them?
Oh! To hell with it!
Bro, then shall we fix it?
Yes, let's fix it right?
Agreed
Accepted
Here's the cheque
No condition
- Your price and
-All your conditions
But, my children...?
Sure, the price
includes them also
What?
lt's okay with us
You can ask your
children and decide
But don't delay it
Fix the price
lt's not that
l have not told them
that l am selling this house
Why? ls the house
in their names?
No, the house and
land is in my name
But if they come to know
that l am selling it fortheir sake
...they will be very upset
They might even
discontinue their course
...and come back here
They have another 6 months to
complete their course
Bro, do you understand
what this implies?
Registration will take place
only after 6 months
lsn't that correct?
We will proceed as decided...
...but let it be kept
a secret for 6 months
And bear the inconvenience
Oh! To bear with them...
Understood
After paying you the money
the house registration is done...
...and once the house
is in their names
...they have to live with you
for 6 months, right?
But how will they do that?
And if they cannot
l definitely cannot
lf you are in their place
will you be able to?
lf you are able to
then say so
We understand the hurt
you are going through mentally
We also have
the medicine to heal that
Continue, sir
You want a particular sum of money
for which you are selling the house
But the children should not know it
lsn't that correct?
We will give you the money
Registration cannot be
kept a secret
The news may
somehow leak out
lf your children come to know
they will be upset
And if they are upset
we will be upset
We have trust in you
So we won't register now
But how...
lt's nothing
No one need know
about anything!
But till then we will
live here with you
What?
On rent
Eh?
The top floor of the house
is vacant, isn't it?
You are all alone
We'll keep you company
in your old age
And you'll get Rs 2000 as rent
You can tell this to everyone
What do you say?
- But won't it be inconvenient to you?
- No, of course not
We have played many roles in life
This is just another one
lt's all for a good cause
lsn't this what we call college life?
Thank you
l don't know how
to show my gratitude
No thanks
God has brought you
to my doorstep
- l love you
- l too
Bro, if you are done, come out
ls this some kind of a love scene?
Bro, how can you sulk like this?
My dear bro, is it possible to decide
everything with everyone, every time?
Bro, don't say a word
You have played
a dirty game here
With what surety did you
give him everything?
lt was a thought that
God threw at me in that minute
Didn't it work successfully?
Of course it did
Bro, your smartness worked
Now he thinks you are God
He says God brought you to him
When he says you
it means both of us
But he hugged only you
Hey don't say such things
lf he hugged me
it's as good as hugging you, right?
- ls that so?
- Yes, of course
But why didn't l see it
when we drank last night?
When he was pouring out drinks
you said equal to only the 2 of you
- ls this like drinking?
- Don't tell me anything more
Everything will turn out beautifully
l am convinced
Look, if you are still doubtful
l will go get it back
Shall l?
Shall l go get it?
No
Not if you are surely convinced
But are you really sure?
Yes, surely, in 2 more days
when our things come
...we can shift
to that house
We tell Mr John
frankly what we think
He will jump with joy
Run and hug
his children and say...
...here are the two who
helped him in a crisis in life
And lots of things
about our generous hearts
About us 2 handsomest of men
What?
Handsomest men?
Didn't you like it?
Okay
They are minds full of love
becomes beautiful
They will accept
Then Mr John totally surprised
will come to meet us
- Will he come?
- He will
- Surely?
- Very sure
Coming soon
There should have been
a song here, bro
Bro, let's stop
this booze habit
Will we not become bad natured?
- Then shall we lessen it?
- Okay
We have to stop
many of our bad habits
lndiscriminate beating, punching...
And then we should start farming
What farming?
What aboutjaathi (caste)?
A big estate full ofjaathi (nut-meg)
But they say jaathi (caste}
should be only one
Then something else
What do you say?
TRUE
We have to go in for
1 or 2 good farming (husbandry)
- Bro, will that John sir cheat us?
- Of course not
- Will those girls end up not liking us?
- Noooo...
- Are you sure?
- Sure
Okay then, good night
Jesus!
God! Now l am sleepless
With unnecessary doubts and questions
Bro, seeing you've lost sleep
l am at peace and feeling very sleepy
Look you've to get up
early for exercise
Try to get some sleep
ls it morning already?
Bro, 1st church bell rang
Come let's go and exercise
- Bro, you do my share also
- Then tomorrow you have to do mine
Jesus
Make my muscles bulge, please
This is for me
This is for bro
Which vagabond has come
so early in the morning?
Haven't you slept yet?
Must be celebrating your victory right?
l don't understand
Aren't you John Samuel's sponsors?
Okay, so who are you now?
l am lsaac and he is Albert
We are known as rowdies
Oh l see
Then rowdies just go away
l need to sleep
You can sleep here
But don't try to sleep there
in John's house
Well we heard about it
2 girls reside there
They may be ours, one day
Just get out
Are you threatening me?
Who is it, bro?
lt's them, bro
Those guys out to get
Mr John's daughters
Remember what
that guy told us?
Those terrible rowdies!
lf you say nonsense...
What's all this?
They claim they'll reshape us
Get out...you!
Let him go
- Get lost
- Go sleep
What's it?
Wait stop
What happened?
Did your eyes
pop out seeing bro?
Or did you think l was alone?
l can very well deal with you alone
Come, buddy...
Sorry...that is...
What's your name?
Brother's name?
Rajinikanth!
Didn't you notice his style?
Get going, dude!
Drunk and blind also
Come, bro
What is it, brother?
What's the issue?
No, it's nothing
What happened, sir?
ls it under repair?
No, the vehicle is
in fine condition
Only 1 problem
lt is not starting
What's all this
in the vehicle?
Just a few dresses
and basic necessities
lt looks quite a big load
We had 4 times this
We just gave it
away to the poor
Donation
Come, come in
Why are you
standing there?
Come here
Hereafter l shouldn't
be inviting you in
You should be
doing it to me
l have finished the formalities
of registration of the house
Here
Why did you do this, sir?
We told you
it could be done later
Things should
never be postponed
ln the last 10 years,
l am happiest today
My dad and grandfather
used to run the hospital
Samuel's hospital
When it faced problems
...the Govt undertook
its administration
Now every 5 years
the executor auctions its lease
l had great ambitions
to take it on lease
And run it in a good way
But l have not been
able to till today
Every time Albert and lsaac
out bid me and took lease
Will you have a small?
- Just a small
- No
No, no!
That hospital is just a facade
for their nefarious activities
A secure cover
Today it's in my hands
And you guys are
responsible for it
l got it back with
the money you gave
Thank you
What are you saying, sir?
We are not strangers
for you to thank us
lt's been so long
since l drank like this
My daughters have advised me
not to overdo it
Doctors will say such things
lsn't this part of college life?
lsn't that correct, bro?
No! Papa you have
to consider your health
Papa! lt's good
being called that way
But l am not that old
Especially metabolic age, just 35
Look l used to be a gymnast
And also a free style boxer
These are the trophies
l got during my heydays
Really?
Why the snigger?
lt's nothing to be ashamed of
lt's a big art, dude
That's not the issue, papa
We also belong to that line
What? Boxing?
Really?
Sir, haven't you
heard of cobra?
ln Delhi the word
cobra sends shivers
- Not cobra, cobras!
- Sorry, cobras
They have
accumulated trophies
...for boxing as well as
hot punches
Punches?
Be quiet, l say
Getting punched
is not bad actually
Only on receiving 2
you get pleasure in giving 2
Oh so come to think of it
...you've become father-in-law
and sons-in-law
So cheers
This is our hospital
Samuel's hospital
Wonderful!
Eh?
Very frightening
to see it
Yeah, yeah
A doctor and 2 nurses
who come and go
...just for name sake
That's how it used to be
Just to fool people
Plenty of dust here
Then why did they run it?
Come, l'll explain
This used to be our
physical training centre
My dad was the main instructor
l too trained here
Later after lsaac
and group took over
...this became a hive
for immoral activities
Booze, women,
gambling, betting
And many other dirty activities
l feel terribly sad
My desire is to
repair the harm done
Come
Go on, ask him
Papa, can l ask you something?
Go ahead
- Shall we run that training centre?
- What?
Stop the car
Come on!
What did you say?
We came here
with the intention
...of starting some business
This is something
we are well versed
We'll do it in a good way
We are capable too
Shall we have a small each?
Oh my goodness!
l'm so excited!
When l am happy
l have to down a drink
Only then it is
a celebration!
Cheers
This is the 5th
No more cheers
You may not able
to sustain anymore
Get lost, buddy
lt is with happiness
Do you know l have
gained 2 children now?
Children who know my mind
You are my good fortune
You are my luck
You are my dear most, dearest...
What's the word?
Dirty fellow!
That's a swear word
What is the word?
- Sons-in-law
- Correct
No!
Beyond that
Far beyond all that
Sweetie, please pour out
1 more peg for me
Papa, please consider
your health also, okay?
What health and what life!
Didn't l educate
my children to this level?
Now, l have to hand them over
to 2 good bride-grooms
That's all l now desire
Papa, what do you mean
by good bridegrooms?
- They should be healthy
- Okay
- Good hearted
- Okay
Handsome
Oh no!
2 fantastic boys
Oh God that's impossible!
Hey dude!
- Sir, beauty is not a disease
- lt's a curse
Get lost
Go, go
We are going, okay?
Papa, what is
your opinion about us?
Very good drunkards, right?
Papa, don't view us
as perpetual drunks
That's alright, dude
Drinking is not wrong
Especially when good people
like us get together
l have a very serious
issue to tell you
Very serious
lf you don't like what l said
you should say so frankly
What is it, papa?
lt concerns my children
How can l tell you this?
- Tell us somehow
- Yes
You guys are very good
and bachelors too
- And anyway you...
-Anyway...what?
Oh forget it
l will tell you later
Papa, please tell
l will...but...
Please
l mean...
Please, papa...please
Oh no, not now
l will tell you later
Here this should help you
get over your bashfulness
- Now tell
- What about my health?
You are healthy, more than
what's necessary
Now drink it and tell
What l was about to say was
the two of you...
- No, l am not saying it now
- Now gulp this down and tell
Jesus!
Brother?
Oh help me please!
- Papa
- Papa
Are you okay?
ls there some problem?
You are okay, aren't you?
Papa?
What were you about to
tell us a short while ago?
- Suppose l go lie down?
- No, before that
Why don't l go lie down?
Who will lie down
at this time of the day?
- Before you lie down
- Oh! Before that l have to pee
Not that papa
You were about to
tell us something
What was that?
Do you also want to pee?
Go ahead and pee
- Oh please tell Papa
- Who?
- Tell us, Papa
- Where?
- Tell, Papa
- Come on tell Papa, dude
What?
Papa, dude?
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing
Two young men
to wed them are here
What does he mean?
We can't get him
Can't you get him?
Poor P.R.O.s
Brother!
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing
Two young men
to wed them are here
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!
Up there in heaven
Yonder up there in heaven
The Grand old man up there
has a little book
ln that little book
is the past and future
ln one of its pages
is divine tidings
Now l have an inner call
to share its contents
The names our Lord
declared for each other
Now lies at the tip
of my tongue
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing
Two young men
to wed them are here
Sir...wake up
Not counting the many men
who exist here
...truthfully how many
among them are suited best
l hesitate to answer
There are two in this world
who are meant to be
With hearts beating a tattoo,
agreeing to the union they stand
Just within the arc of my sight
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing
Two young men
to wed them are here
Oh! What fun!
- What's happened to him?
- Papa?
Get lost, you pork
Bro, did you hear
what papa said now
- Get lost, you pork!
- Keep quiet, you pig!
Papa mentioned about
our marriage, didn't he?
May be, but it was
not clear enough
Papa
Why don't you go sleep?
Tomorrow when he wakes up
and is out of his stupor
...we can find out
what he wanted to say
- Get lost, you dog!
- Corpse!
Sleep?
How can he sleep like this
when we are burning with anxiety?
Papa
- l have a great idea
- What is that?
There is a panacea to wake
people sleeping fully drunk
What is that?
Take a glass, pour a peg into it
Then pour 1 more peg of brandy
Just give it to him
lmmediately his head will clear
lnstead can we not
just give him 2 pegs?
Then it will be a dry drink
Sorry, you are correct
Shall we give it to him, sir?
l don't care what you do
l have to know the news today
We shall definitely know
if it's a yes or a no
Take the tools, Bala
- Tools?
- Bring the brandy
Oh okay brandy, l will
be right back
Papa
Papa, open your mouth
Careful!
l wish we had a tube
lt'd have been so useful
- Where to go for a tube now?
- Hey old man! Open your mouth
Don't spill
even a drop
Brother
l'll give you
a good spanking, okay?
Open his mouth
All of you move aside
Annie and Shirley, isn't it?
Who are you?
Who the heck are you guys?
l said who are you?
Look, we are...
Brother
When we were passing
by this way, we saw papa...
- l mean we are his friends
- Friends?
What were you
doing to him?
When he over-ate during dinner
we thought we'd give him some juice
- Papa?
- Juice?
Yes, applejuice
Look at its color
You thought it was brandy, right?
Fooled you!
Shirley, papa is drunk
- ls this juice?
-Apple juice
Get out
Get out, l say
Out, l said!
Or should l call the police?
Wait
Let me explain things
We are tenants here
What?
Tenants here?
Yes, here on the 1st floor
And each of us
pay a rent of Rs 1000
When Mr John said his
daughters were in Bangalore
...and all alone here,
we felt very sad
Considering he's an old man
we shifted in here
...to keep him company
Agreed
But is this what
tenants usually do?
When a person
is already unconscious
...do you give him more
and try to kill him?
Was he unconscious?
We never knew that at all!
lsn't that so, bro?
Sorry
Get out
Get out
What's this?
l am going
Don't beat me
Shirley, what are you doing?
We are tenants
When l say get out
it means out!
Shirley, don't
Don't close the door
They shut the door also
Bro, all the wood has arrived
Shall we start work today?
Wait, don't start
We ourselves are
quite worked up here
Let things get
resolved here
Mason, go and drink a strong
cup of tea and come
There's no use
lying like this
Now decide
what should be done
Get lost
Yesterday was a blunder
Hereafter there won't
be any problems
- Why? Did you go there?
- No, not that
l was just thinking it over
Yesterday there was some mistake
lts only now that l remembered
there won't be a problem again
Tell us, what it is,
you idiot!
Remember we poured brandy into brandy
and gave it to him?
l have to curse my memory
lt's actually not like that
We must pour
curd into brandy
lt struck me only now
We'll never have
a problem again
Aiyo!
l'll kill you today
Aiyo!
Hey wait! Wait!
Tell me, what is the problem?
There's nothing new
Yesterday's problems are
continuing, that's all
Sir!
Don't go, wait
l realized the girls had come
only when l woke up this morning
So l came here
before they woke up
l figured there
was a problem
Actually what
happened last night?
Without doubt
a complete mess!
When you blabbered after
drinking yourself senseless...
...Cobras thought you were planning
to get them married to your girls
But by the time you
got around telling
...you just conked off
To get you to say it clearly
we tried some panacea...
What?
l mean, we fed
you a little brandy
And your daughters walked in
That became a major issue
Frankly, do you
remember...
...even a word of what you
said last night? Any clue?
True! l did say all that in
a state of unconsciousness
Actually l wanted to tell them
all that when l was sober
Look, l approve of you completely
But that's not enough
They should like you
For that you should be able
to try to get into their hearts
And that's where
your smartness lies!
What a marvelous dad!
Where in heaven will you get
a father-in-law like this, guys?
Forget how they'll
get to their hearts
1st decide how you will
get into that house
Hmmm...it is a problem
But no, actually it is not
For the incident that
happened last night
...l have to create
a counter story
And get them to believe me
Do you know, l am not only ex-boxer
l am ex-writer, too
l used to write stories and send
to Bala-lokam magazine
l have even got
consolation prizes
Now, l will create a story
to tell my girls
...which will convince them
and l am very sure of this
You just wait and
see my dear chaps!
- Will he make it worse now?
- Of course
No Papa! You don't have to
cook up some new tales
After all we know
you very well, papa
True Papa, when we came in
you were already unconscious...
...and they were forcing you
to drink more booze
Yes, but why?
Have you bothered
to find out why?
Did you?
You haven't
lf l am alive today
it's all due to them
Do you realize that?
Do you know?
What is it, papa
What happened?
l'll tell you
Yesterday, my college
classmate had come here
College?
When did you go
to college, Papa?
l meant the friend
who'd studied in a college
- What about it?
- What is his name?
Plachimoottil Sashi
What about that?
Continue, Papa
And then...
He is a compulsive
traveler, this Sashi
During one of his travels
when he gave tobacco to a tribal
...he got a gift in return
- Papa?
- Yes?
This katumootil Shashi
lt is neither katumootil or aatukootil
lt is Plachimoottil Sashi
Oh well, if you say
Plachi then so be it
ls he also a tribal man?
Okay enough
l'm not saying anything
Shirley, be quiet
Papa, you continue
l've lost the mood
Okay, l'm not talking any more
Do you know what the gift was?
A whole bottle of distilled liquor
When he came here
he gave it to me and went back
- Was it, back to the forest?
- Oh...
Okay, okay...go on
Last evening lost in
thoughts about you
...as l was looking at this photo
somehow l felt the need to drink
There on the table
was the bottle of alcohol...
...Plachimootil Shashi had given
beckoning to me
Being a gift from a friend
and being lonely without you
...l drank just one mouthful
And after that...
...l felt darkness
creeping into my eyes
Electric waves in my head
l fell down
My children Annie, Shirley
Forgive me, l am dead
They camejust on time
like angels sent by God
Sir
Oh God!
l wonder if its blood cancer
Good Lord of Kottayam!
lt's the phone ringing
- Hello! ls it the doctor?
- No
- No?
- l am Plachimootil Sashi
The drink which l gave
Mr John contains poison
l came to know of it only now
Ask him not to drink it
- Will you do the needful?
-Aiyo!
Oh God! Please don't let
anything happen to our Mr John
Who was it?
Bro, that Plachimootil
Shashi called
He says the liquor
he gave was poisonous
Oh my God!
Now who will look after
Shirley and Annie?
- There's a way
- What way?
Do you have cash with you?
Yes, about 3 to 4 crores
But all in the bank
And we cannot withdraw today
Today is a holiday
- Oh it is today, isn't it?
- Yes it is
Okay, there's another way out
Look after him
Nothing should happen to him
Give him last-aid
(first-aid) properly
Oh, artificial air
Oh God! This looks
like it's death by a bullet
That too, to a vital organ
lt's a natural death
- Look, give him this
- Here's the glass
- What ls this?
- Don't you see? Brandy
Now pour it out
Oh so he's sick,
deprived of booze is it?
Just feed him this
lf you drink poisoned liquor
the best antidote is brandy
l read this in the papers
while on my way back from Vypin
Should it be given
before food or after food?
lt was when they were struggling
to save my life that you came in
Who are you guys?
This is what actually
happened last night
Best story!
Why? You don't
believe me, do you?
Shirley, be quiet
Do you feel
any discomfort now?
- Yes...
- Oh my!
My dear foolish sister,
did you believe this stupid story?
- Don't say anything anymore
- Yes, my dear
lf l cut open and show my heart
she'll only say it's a red shoe-flower
l am totally upset
l want to lie down
Papa, please don't over act
And bring illnesses which don't exist
l believe you, enough?
But l am sure
of one more thing
l think these cobras
are not so poisonous
Otherwise your imagination
...wouldn't run wild
like this to save them
- lsn't it?
- Oh go away!
- So were you lying?
-A little bit
No, don't!
Oh! Don't sulk
You are my sweetie pie
So, my dear...shall l ask them
to come back here?
- Please?
- Thank you
Sir, you haven't
given me a reply
What reply?
We are not
going anywhere
We are not their play things
to throw us out and call us in
...as when it pleases them
- lsn't it so brother?
- Of course
Bro, concentrate
Look, this is a sort of
sneaky punch, okay?
Forget all that
Be quiet, you dog
My tooth just came off
l didn't mean that
l was talking about
what those girls said
Husbands and wives
will naturally behave like this
Husbands and wives?
When did that happen?
Not yet, but when it does
things like this might happen
Yes, correct
Just think
this was a rehearsal
Since they cried
and begged forgiveness
Forgiveness?
Who did?
Not exactly, but it will happen
Otherwise will MrJohn send us
to bring you there so confidently?
Well, why don't we go, bro?
- No, we should not rush like that
- We'll lose our weight, right?
Let's have 2 pegs and then go
What do you say?
But didn't we decide
to stop booze, bro?
Why?
For whom?
Ah, why are you
standing there?
- Come in
- Bro?
Don't move
Be like a statue
Let them beg
forgiveness at our feet
Hey! Come in
Where are they?
Don't make noise
They've slept
You guys, come in
Will it turn unpleasant?
Just don't make noise
Come
- Did you eat anything?
- No
lt's alright
There's water in the room
Drink and go to sleep
- Don't make a sound
- Stop there!
Bro
- Jesus!
-Are you drunk?
Are we?
- No
- No
lt's quite obvious
You resort to
hooliganism, right?
Don't step in here again
afterfights and brawls
lf l hear of any such thing, at once
l'll chuck you out, l warn you
Go
What is this?
Ajail?
No drinks, no smoke
l am becoming mad
lt will all be okay
Here drink this
When the 2 of you get married
sister will calm down all by herself
What?
Marriage?
Go climb a wall!
l don't want her,
Bhadrakali (fiery goddess)
She matches you perfectly
Go and marry her
What the hell
are you saying?
That girl is for you
l already consider her my sister
You will drink water (be in trouble)
Bro, l mean, go ahead drink water
Not only that, she is
the best girl for you to wed
To scold you, to control you
she is the best person
Oh is she? Let her come to me
with all that
She does not know
my real nature
l will throw her out
like a door mat
What is it?
Nothing, has Papa
gone to sleep?
What was all that about
throwing someone out?
- Was it me?
- No
l was just saying we should
have a doormat outside
- The dust is full of room you see
- What?
- Bro, it's room full of...
- What? Shut up
The room is full of dust
Okay have it your way!
Have you guys had anything?
- Yes just a small one
- Not that
- l asked if you've had dinner?
- Yes, a small one
Tell me the truth,
yes or no?
- Chinese food...
- No
Hey bro!
lt's okay
Come downstairs
What did you do now?
Shameful
What's there to be shameful
l'm so hungry l'm going blind
-Aren't you coming?
- Not me
- Don't you want to eat?
- No
l am going
Bro, l can smell chicken
The curry is yummy
The rice is very good
But you haven't eaten yet
Looks can tell, isn't it?
Yes, of course
lt's quite obvious
what you mean
Enough, dude!
lf so, then you can
leave the table, sir
Hey, go away
He thinks
he's being funny
Are you twins?
No, we are Christians
Truly
No, my dear chap
She asked if you were
born at the same time
Yes, of course
Then why is one
of you so dark?
- No, it's nothing...
- Mom delivered me on time
But he was in
the womb for longer
And browned a bit
more lying there
That's a good joke
Oh you are a great
joker, aren't you?
When you know
me better you'll see
...whoever talks to me
dies of laughter
Many who wanted to die
have come to meet him
- That was superb!
- You deserve it
Never speak about another's
short comings and be smart
But who said anything
about short comings
We said he was just
darkerthan normal, right?
Look this is just ajoke, okay?
The 2 of you don't look
like brothers at all
Especially twins
Like we belong
to 2 fathers, right?
No, l did not mean that
Bro, aren't you finishing?
No, l am full
Are you also stopping?
Yes, enough
Doesn't matter,
you continue
Oh you are lying here, is it?
Where is he?
He's gone to sleep
He's very upset, isn't he?
No, that's alright
He's used to
hearing such things
We were born in a hospital
in Kuala Lumpur
Mom and dad died in an attack
and blast in the hospital
Later uncle and
aunt brought us
...to our native home, Kottayam
Aunt and uncle felt one of us
was exchanged in that incident
Many people said twins
need not be identical
But they found it
difficult to accept it
Bro went through many
rejections and insults
He was looked upon
like a burden
...and alienated
from everyone
Put your hand
on their shoulders
Bro, come
Take one of us together
That one is
already approved
Hey! Leave us
Let go my hand
Sir, you wanted twins
forthe play
Look, they are twins
Teacher! Look at them
They claim they are twins
Oh what identical looks!
They are perfect twins!
Boys, were you really born
to the same father?
Leave me alone
Oh! What a greatjoke!
He could nevertolerate anyone
insulting or hurting me
He has always believed that
he isn't really my biological brother
He believed he was
a responsibility thrust on me
Bro, where are you going
leaving me alone?
l am going
l will go find your real brother
and bring him to you
No, you are my brother
Only you
Come, let's go back
- No, l'm not going back there
- Then l am coming with you
l will be with you, bro
wherever you go
His decision was very firm
He says if ever
he finds my real twin
...he will leave me forever
without being a burden anymore
But l cannot live without him
Not even for a minute
Sorry
What for?
l was just unnecessarily...
She's finding it
difficult to face you
That's why she sent me
She did not say
all that to hurt you
Now when brother explained...
lt's alright
l am destined to
hear such things
l am an orphan
But there are many to love him
Relatives and other dear ones
He left all that
to come with me
l am very sure
that he has a brother
l will find him
God will show him
Bro has to suffer so many
shameful situations everywhere
Aren't you lucky to get
such a loving brother?
Why don't you think
everything has happened forthe best?
The pain of being
separated at birth
lt's a pain all by itself
Well, that's why it's said
separated at birth
TRUE
Do you know
when l delivered...
What
You delivered?
No, l meant my mother
When l was born
Blood could be seen
Why? Did you have
ulcers on yourface?
No, l was so fair,
chubby and beautiful
The nurse who cleaned me up
accepted a bribe
...and gave me away
to a rich man
ln return his blackened
and scrawny baby
...was given back to my mother
That black, thin fellow
is me, a vagabond!
The real me, am somewhere
...in a rich man's house
all fair and chubby
l don't understand anything
So you sitting here?
This me who's sitting here
is not actually me
l am somewhere
in an unknown place
Handsome and
rich, living happily
Don't drink like this, buddy
Your liver will wilt away
Let it wilt,
what does it matter to me?
lt's not my liver after all
lt's that thin reedy
black fellow's liver
Let him die
Let that cheater die
l am living in some
millionaire's house
All fair and handsome
With a beautiful wife
Probably drinking
milk and Bournvita
Don't cry, buddy
Hello, Kari sir
What's your intention?
No use!
Hello, Raja sir
Please say something
You've been
cycling so long
Where are you off to
in such a tearing hurry?
Stop for a minute
Stop it!
What do you want?
Nothing
lt was fun saying that!
ln a temper
Very hot
l will go
Sir, what is the issue now?
Hasn't it all been resolved?
Let's go to the house
And explain everything
What will you explain?
No! That will not work out
We've become jokers
Among all of them
Enough
Let's put an end to it
So are we not
going there?
Why? To meet whom?
Bro, all this is not meant for us
Family, children and such things
Not only that
We aren't suitably matched also
They are well educated
Enough, let's give it up
And go away from here
Here...
Where are you off to?
School or college?
What?
l asked because l heard
you say you lacked education
Okay, let's leave that aside
That's your problem
But when tenants vacate
there are some formalities
At least the rent for the period
you stayed has to be paid
We've come to collect that rent
But that...
Each of you have
to pay it separately
Why?
No money, is it?
No...Yes...there is
Come, let's go
take it
Stop! Stop!
When the house owner
is alive here
...what rights do you have
to demand and accept rent?
Well, now that you've taken it
give this back to this owner
And you give it back
to this owner
What are you gaping for?
House owners
Come on, accept it
l confessed
everything to them
The fact that you bought the house
the secret desires in your heart
They too are totally happy with it
Sing, sing...
Together, together...
Sing, sing...
sing a song
Together, together...
together they unite
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree
Oh nomadic breeze
Oh don't you see
the blushing cheeks
...of the little dragon fly
Oh don't you hear
a heart beating like drums
Beneath the canopy of raindrops
for these 2 beautiful little women
...filled with desires appeared
duo-partners from out of the blue
2 different bodies
sharing one mind
Two pairs of eyes
now double fold
Sing, sing...
sing a song
Together, together...
together they unite
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree
Oh nomadic breeze
Don't worry at all
You can pay my bill also
Glances have clashed...
Lo! Glances have collided
There's a smattering of honeyed
tunes humming on their lips
Oh look! Laughter has blossomed
They have exchanged
thoughts without words
On the veranda of dreams...
as they met...they twittered
...like birds reveling in
mischievous whispers
Sing, sing...
sing a song
Together, together...
together they unite
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree
Oh nomadic breeze
Oh! There shines...a golden light
As the day comes nearer
for them to share their desire
As time told a story...oh! Hear
as this time told a story...
All the rooms in this house
echoed in happiness
When tomorrow a new dawn
blushes in the skies
May their platter of dreams
be filled with flowers
Sing, sing...
sing a song
Together, together...
together they unite
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree
Oh nomadic breeze
Sing, sing...
sing a song
Together, together...
together they unite
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree
Oh nomadic breeze
Are you still standing here?
Go look at the fire works
Now?
Dude, l am talking
about the crackers
Oh God!
The Minister is here
Attached to this hospital
a physical fitness centre
...will start functioning
from next Sunday
l wish to inform you
this happy news, today
The persons who have undertaken
to conduct it are doing so...
...with good intentions
and with respectability
l wish to introduce those
respectable individuals to you
Please
On this auspicious day
l wish to share...
...a purely personal
news with all of you
They are also
my future sons-in-law
l invite High courtjudge
Honorable Mr Paneerselvam
...to speak a few words
seeking his best wishes
Please, wait a second
You can wait
a while forthe speech
What's it?
This physical centre
functioned earlier also
But everyone knows
what exactly was going on here
But in future such things
won't happen if MrJohn runs it
We don't know from where
these 2 guys have come
We have to enquire
about them very well
My friend, l have made all enquiries
l am sure they will run it beautifully
What's the surety?
What did you enquire?
You have announced that you were getting
your daughters married to them too
What do you know about them?
Yes, dude
l enquired about them
Okay, do you know
this is their 2nd wedding?
Beware, you don't
make derogatory comments
Yes, it is derogatory indeed
To marry in one land,
collect all you can from there
...and go to a new place
and repeat the holy act
This is surely derogatory
lf you talk nonsense
about our boss...
Get lost! You!!
Look these are certificates from
Kothamangalam sub registrar office
Proof of their
register marriage
On November 2nd
Now tell me, my dear sir
...how good was
your enquiry about them?
My dear children,
what is all this?
This is a trap
A trap
Yes, it's a trap
One that should
get you life imprisonment
Judge and police are all here
Let them decide
No!! l will not believe this
These are things
which anyone can fabricate
He is capable not only of this
but things worse than this
Okay, all this is false
So leave it
Dude, bring them here
Hello, now tell me
ls this also another fraud?
What happened, cobras?
Cat got yourtongue?
Sir, put them behind bars
Do you have anything to say?
Nothing
What can they say?
We'd like to explain, sir
lt's true we married them
in the registrar office
When later that wedding
was called off at the church
...shame facedly
we ended everything
...and came here
But we did not know
it had not ended
...that they were
still waiting for us
lt was a mistake
due to our ignorance
We have hurt many people
You have to forgive us
and bear with us
Hey, don't try
to slink away like that
Tell us what to do
regarding them?
What else?
They have to marry them
They should marry them
here in public
Brother
Ask them
Now whatever we do
will be wrong
You are intelligent and educated
Tell us what should we do?
Who should we accept?
Whoever you accept
it will be right
But accepting them
will be a bigger 'right'
You should accept them
Hey! Enough of all this
Enough of all this drama
That long haired fellow
promised us lots of money...
...to just come and
stand here, so we came
He has not told us
about this garland sequence
Neither will all that happen
To tell you the truth
they are our wives
We do not want to be a part
of breaking up a relationship
Come
Have you any shame?
You creeps!
Stabbing from behind
and betraying, you are 2 corpses!
Real men stand
face to face and fight
They don't do
wretched things like you
Go and die somewhere
Pigs!
Stop it
Stop it, l say!
We'll fight face to face
Come we'll fight face to face
lf you are truly spunky, come
Let's face each other
What happened? Have your
so-called men got scared?
We are ready
Ask them also to come
We'll show you
who are real men
-Are you prepared?
- Of course, we are
But if you are beaten...
...we should never see you
on this land again
You should go away
Far away from this place
Agreed?
Agreed
And if we win?
Don't grin
lf we win you'll have to
give up this hospital...
...and assets to us
which you have leased
We'll give it up
not for leased amount
Forfree
Free
Then tell us where and when
we meet this challenge
- Papa
- Keep quiet, my son
Sunday at the new
Physical Centre
l am saying this
for all of you to know
This shall be the inaugural function
of the Physical Centre
Exactly at 5:00 P.M
- Okay?
- Okay
Okay, dude
Good! Very good!
Excellent!
What did he excel in?
Who did he think he was?
To challenge like knights of old
l am not for all this
To bear blows and
die in front of people
This challenge
shouldn't take place
We should end it
We should finish
both of them before that
Judge grandpa has to tell us
how to do it
Whatever you try
lt's equal to the hangman's noose
around your own necks
Both this secret war
and secret arms, is now dangerous
l told you long back
Go back into their pasts
You'll get your
weapon from there
We did that
and found those two girls
What happened after that?
You wentjust
4 months backward
But l will go back
in decades
From the time
they were born
...to the place they were born
What l got was a weapon
which will tear them at their roots
You mentioned the other day
...that 1 of them looked very much
like Naidu of Kuala Lumpur
You left that trail
l started from where you left off
A weapon to divide into 2
those who are 1
An invincible weapon
1 who does not hesitate
to do anything for money
Shivadas Naidu
- Mr Jayavardan
- Yes?
l am a great fan of yours
lf you don't mind
can l have a picture with you?
Sure, why not?
Just a second
Great
Thank you so much
l have a funny idea
Can l measure
my palm against yours?
Just once
Please?
Mine is a bit bigger
Best of luck for the final
- Come on, beat him up
- Papa!
- Be quiet
- He's cheating
Hello
Who is it?
1 minute
- Here, phone for you
- For me?
Who is it?
Hello, who is it?
Who?
- Who's it, bro?
- l don't know
- Hello
- Hello
- Who is it?
- Hello, Mr Raja?
- Yes
- l am Shivadas Naidu
- Who?
- Shivadas Naidu
Who? l don't place you
Very far away
but a very near relation
Relation, meaning brother
Your twin brother, Shivadas Naidu
What are you saying?
Where are you speaking from?
Forthe time being
Coimbatore
l want to meet you
Where should l come?
No, don't come here
l will come and see you
Hotel Blue Diamond
Room number 207
- Where's room number 207?
- Upstairs, right and last room
Brother, do you have
a match stick with you?
Are you deaf?
Welcome Mr Raja
Come in
Don't hesitate
We've not tricked you
We didn't call you?
lt was Shivadas himself
But not from here
From Kuala Lumpur
Look at the number
in your phone
How can you believe
in your enemies, isn't it?
Look he's online
Talk to him
Cheers, brother!
No! Tell me
why l was asked to come
l'll be right back
This is great!
When you finally find
your long lost brother
...now you don't want him
Why is it like that, lsaac?
ls it because you may have to
share your inherited assets?
No, that could not be
a possibility
You'd already denounced
wealth and relatives
...with some stranger
who you claim is your brother
lf your real brother turned up...
...are you scared
that you'll lose this brother?
Yes, that's it
That is your fear
But Albert...
...that Shivadas
doesn't seem to have...
...any love or sentiments
to this fellow
He is more interested
in this guy's dead father's wealth
What will he do now?
l have long since
given up all that
l don't want anything
Let him have everything
Good
Good deed, indeed!
But still there's a problem
These 2 brothers have to
undergo DNA test...
...and prove that
they are brothers
We shall do it somehow
- lsn't it?
- Yes
lf that brother who's with you
comes to know
...will he have a problem?
Come on
Say something
l figure this is a threat
What do you want?
You are quite smart
lntelligent
Forget it
What do we want, eh?
Nothing
They want the hospital building
Forthat either you withdraw
from this contest...
...or be defeated voluntarily
lf both are not acceptable?
He will come
Shivadas Naidu
Then you and
your supposed brother...
...can decide what you want
lf you accept defeat
he won't come out in the open
He'll return
without anyone knowing
We will settle his accounts
whatever his demands are
Now decide whether
you want to beat them and live on
Or not lose the brother
who's been with you all along
You can go
Brother
Why here?
Don't you always say
l might have another brother?.
Do you really believe
there's one?
No
But l am always scared
Whenever l say that
you insist there couldn't be one
When l hear that
there is peace for me
l keep repeating it only to
hear you console me
Sorry, bro
l won't ever say it again
Promise
Well, it appears
there is someone like this
Yes bro, l talked to him
He was the one
who phoned me
No, someone is pulling
a fast one on you
No bro, it's the truth
l went to meet him
the other day
But he's being used to bait us
by lsaac and others
Bro, so l am a nobody?
You are my only brother
l have only you
No, l am nobody
l am no one to you
- No one
- Brother!
No one
No one, l don't want to live
Bro, stop
Listen to me
Bro...th...er!
Brother!
What has happened
to this fellow?
He didn't sleep well last night
He was tossing and turning
the whole night
Withdrawal symptoms
after stopping booze
- So you are still continuing, eh?
- Just a small
Hey
As a coach l forbid you
- Papa?
- Eh?
How strong are
lsaac and Albert?
- Nothing to be scared of
- No?
But...
But what Papa?
Hello!
Why is this cobra shivering?
What?
Don't give the slip, okay?
Have you heard of Jatlas
who scared the whole of Jalandhar
They were this size, both of them
Bro, flattened both of them
Do you know that?
- Oh, only brother
- Me too
For these fellows
l need only my left hand
My left hand
is already tingling
But why is
your left hand tingling?
What?
Papa we are leaving
What was there
to laugh about?
Papa, all of you together
bamboozled me
Why did you give your left hand
so much importance?
That's because the left hand...
Oh here he is!
Dude, you should have
punctuality and practice
Will you squander away
my hospital and money invested?
- Lets avoid this match Papa
- What?
Neither should we win
the hospital in that manner
Have you lost your mind?
What the heck are you saying?
Yes bro, lets avoid
this contest and triumph
We had stopped it all, right?
What about the challenge
they threw at us
The competition too was fixed?
That was neither me nor you
Papa just said it
in an emotional moment
We'll forget it
Forget it?
What are you saying?
l have put into it
all my earnings of my entire life
This is to compensate forthat
The documents of ownership
of this house you made out to us
We don't want all these
Let it be in your name, papa
Brother
Tell me
Why this change of mind?
Didn't l tell you?
l feel this is right now
You should stand by me
That will be difficult
Bro, we were born
and brought up together
Till today l have listened
only to what you said
But today forthe 1st time
you have to do as l wish
For my sake
For our sake
lt will be difficult
You should not fail
Not in front of anyone
Not even before me
But here l need to win
Not to you
But for my girl
whom l love a lot
l have to compete
in this contest
Even if l die fighting
l'd be a winner to her like a man
l have been with the 2 of you
Only for a few months
But l know for sure
you are good hearted
This decision too has
some hidden good intention
You have to tell me what it is
Come on, tell me, my son
l know for sure
bro will end up doing that
He will not be able to bearthat
Your decision is the right one
And you have no choice
lf l was in your place
l would do the same
l respect that decision wholly
But l will not be able
to withdraw from this
The mistake is on my part
l yelled out
that challenge unthinkingly
But l have to hang on
to that mistake
You would do the same
if you were in my place
lf l back out of this
it's as good as dying
A most disgraceful death
He will not be alone in the arena
l'll also be with him
l know we'll never win
But l will fight till l die
Oh God! Look it's time to start
Son, in a momentary impulse
l announced l'd punch and box
Will he come?
He will come
lt's time
He will come
l am very sure
- Papa, don't be scared
- Who me? Scared?
My hands and feet are shivering
And l am freezing with fear
There goes the gong!
Good evening
Ladies and gentlemen
The main event tonight
features a championship match
The winner of this match

My son, he has still not come

Shivadas
Brother!
1 ...2...3...4...5...6...
Aaaah!
That's it, over!
Ladies and gentlemen
The champions!
Brothers need not necessarily
be only those born to one mother
You are true brothers
l do not want
to come between you
But both of you will always
be there in my heart!
Play around with
these venomous fellows
Sure you'll soon reach
the burial ground
Not fake playthings they be, excuse me
They may be 2 different bodies
But of same minds always
Cut them into two bits
and the bits would soon unite
To dig out the bowels
of the one who chopped them
To bury them alive
along with ample proof
The cobra that's blackened
in coal, huge and venomous
To enchant, ensnare and
tame this snake into captivity
lnto the basket, don't...
oh snake charmer go away
Strength of family ties
to them are non existent
Their only strength
is within and between them
That strength is
of mammoth proportion
Even a cobra fears another
which is more venomous
A cobra he is, not to be
taunted by an eagle
They are here, who shake
the very foundations of a place
They belong neither to a particular
country, town, place or a home
They may be rascals but never
will this brave pair smoke a beedi
lf they love
they'll lick them to death
lf you hurt them
they'll strike you dead
Once you are bitten
don't even try to cure
For it will be a wasted
effort oh medicine man!
No eagle will hover over a cobra
Neither can you trap,
not even by a hair's breadth
lf a water snake can
make you forego dinner
...the cobra is there to
stop your breath forever
A cobra has no thoughts
of past nor future
To retaliate to the stamp
he got on his back
He needs only
half a minute
He's never an earthworm
He'll snap and snap again
He'll draw a line
Oh yes! He'll underline
He will underline
the life of his prey
with a slight smile
Please tell a new proverb
about the cobra
Oh, one who quotes
proverbs in broad day light
Oh Munshi...
