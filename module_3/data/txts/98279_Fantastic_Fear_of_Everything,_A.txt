- Hello.
- Hello.
This is Crispian Mills, the director
and conspirator on <i>Fantastic</i> Fear.
And this is Simon Pegg...
<i>...the actor and co-conspirator
on Fantastic Fear of Everything.</i>
And this is Universal's
hundredth anniversary logo which--
- Didn't you have to fight to get this?
- Yeah, this is their megalomaniac logo...
...which dwarfs the world.
- It screams how big I am.
- This is--
Yeah. This is Indomina,
inspired by Lorna Mann.
- That's a lovely origami egg there...
- Yeah.
...to symbolise fun and rebirth.
- And Pinewood.
- What's this one?
Lovely, good old Pinewood.
- Very solid logo. A big white tablet.
- Solid. Green too.
Supposed to be a spotlight.
Is it? I like the way it's green too,
to infer pine as well.
<i>Once upon a time...</i>
...not so long ago...
Well, here we are, in London town.
The idea behind the whole
of this title sequence...
...was that it looked kind of like
the matte paintings...
...that you would see
in one of those old '60s films.
Something like the beginning
of Mary Poppins...
...where you know
it's not supposed to be real.
It's a representation,
like, kind of like a nice painting.
What we do is I do a matte painting
that actually has animation in it...
...which, as you can see
from the clouds and the water...
...and the poor guy
hanging from the bridge...
...we did. But the idea was that it had a--
It was very still, very sort of static.
And with a few of these moving elements.
But I love it. I think it's a wonderful setup.
I love it because it sets the tone of the film.
And, you know, the kind of--
The strangeness of it.
It's exactly what it needed.
Oh, that's a big old hello.
- My agent working hard.
- Get him out the way.
Nudged out.
- Should have had a sound effect there.
- Brilliant. Beautiful.
- Big eye, big heart.
- Exactly.
- What they say about me.
- This is the--
Now, that eyebrow hair is out of control.
I wanna deal with that. Deal with that today.
Clare, if you're listening...
...can you put me in an appointment
at the eyebrow surgeon?
- Alternative, if you're watching the DVD, do it as well.
- Yeah.
It's one of those things
where you start off...
...with a big full-screen homage.
Actually, according to Pedro Almod√©var...
...there's a difference
between homage and theft.
And if, you know,
if stealing an idea really works...
...for a film, then it's Worth doing.
Yeah, if you're making a comment
about a previous thing...
...if you're drawing attention
to the cultural collective memory...
...then it's a homage.
Or saying something about the original thing.
If you just steal the idea, thinking
that no one will notice, that's theft.
That's nicking.
I'm big on homage. I do a lot of homages...
...in mine and Edgar's stuff and--
It's because we're saying something
about things that have gone before.
Here's the-- This is the eyeball theme.
It's beginning here, to creep in.
Now, what would you say that was
a reference to, the eyeball, if at all?
Is it a <i>Peeping</i> Tom? Is it a--?
<i>Yeah, it's Peeping Tom...</i>
...and Repulsion, obviously,
which starts with the eye, and Psycho.
This scene was a lot of fun to put together...
...because it really didn't come to life...
...until, obviously, we put the voiceover on...
...which we recorded before we started shooting.
We did it twice. We sort of
did it again afterwards when we--
When you had the edit in place.
So this was great stuff
that came together actually...
...when we started shooting. We had the little bit
in the script about he mimes the stabbing.
But you put together this little bit.
- I held the knife--
- On the spot.
- A stabbed styling.
- Which was great.
Right, there's so much detail here.
If you want to pause your video, there's that guy--
- Video?
- Yeah.
I still call it video recorder.
This commentary is being done
in the year 1983.
That's my good friend, Don Pecker.
Who plays the Santa later on.
Yeah. He's a go--
He's a top busker in Taunton.
People noticed that when I was doing press.
They were pleased that they had,
and I was very pleased...
...that they had noticed
that the Santa was the Hendon Ogre.
Red telephone. Classic danger.
<i>If the telephone rang at half past</i> 4...
I love the way the banana
makes its first appearance here.
Yeah.
That's not symbolic in any way.
<i>How could anybody have known at the time...</i>
<i>...how important that telephone call was to become ?"</i>
What--? Now, the film, initially on the page--
The writing process is something
that changes throughout the whole--
- Hold on. Here he is, his first appearance.
- There's Alan.
Coming in.
The thing about Perkins here is that--
He appears in the distance as a small character...
...then building up through the film,
he becomes more and more--
- He gets closer and closer.
- Present and scenes last longer...
...until he's basically dominating the whole--
- Tony Perkins. Anthony Perkins. Get it?
- Absolutely.
The film started in a different way on the page.
We started with a flashback to Jack's childhood...
...which you decided in the edit
would be better served elsewhere.
That little scene with the boy in the launderette
in the middle of the film actually sta--
It used to start the script...
...but we really needed to introduce things slowly...
...and get people to settle in with one reality at a time.
So it all settles down and allows people
to have a bit of fun with Jack...
...and his ridiculous apartment
he lives in and that world is so rich.
It was actually a bit too much information to take in.
That was a fun odd week. it--
Just us, me and you guys in that flat.
It was the week after we'd shot the stuff in the launderette.
- Yeah.
- So we'd said pretty much bye to--
There he is, Kiran!
<i>- Star of Willow.
- Star of Willow.</i>
And--
One of the hardest working
short actors in short show business.
<i>- Yeah, and he's in The Hobbit too.
- He's in The Hobbit, yeah.</i>
He was-- I think he was Elijah Wood's double.
Not double, but his short double.
A sweet guy and a great chain smoker...
...and has a fantastic pair of cowboy boots.
L'Etoile. My picture's up on the wall there now.
- Is it?
- Yeah.
Elena's L'Etoile, this a legendary
restaurant in the West End.
It has all these portraits of actors
and producers and writers...
...who have frequented it and eaten snails there.
Mickey Feast. Mickey Feast.
Mickey Feast, one of the original
actors, used to hang out in the flat...
...that Withnailwas based on.
It was Mickey Feast, Viv MacKerrell, Bruce Robinson...
...Leigh Lawson. All used to hang out in Camden.
If you go to the deleted scenes, you'll find a bit...
...when I go into the restaurant
and have that exchange with Mickey.
Yeah, the full unedited scene which is great...
...is there now. You can see that with Mickey...
...and also the back end of this scene...
...which we can't sacrifice in the name of pace.
<i>--Of organised crime.</i>
I like that little turn to the page.
It's worth noting that I didn't trim my nasal hair or nails...
...or anything for the duration of this film...
...hence the forest.
Great pratfall. Here she comes.
- The magic spider.
- Oh, and then, we have one of the--
We've got the magic spider, Hellraiser herself.
- Very fitting.
- And one of your former bandmates?
And Hammond maestro, Henry Broadbent, there he is.
- That's Henry.
- One of the greatest moustaches in music.
Now, there was a line there that I always really liked...
...which you decided to lose
and I was totally in agreement in the end...
...but it was something about John Hurt.
What was it? "Who's down there, John Hurt?"
Yeah, exactly. "Oh, I saw somebody under the table."
"Who was it, John Hurt?"
I just thought that was so--
I had a friend who was good friends with John Hurt.
I said, "Will he mind?" He said:
"He's got absolutely no sense
of humour about his alcoholism."
- Really?
- Or his drinking or his alcoholic past.
He's a fantastic guy, but, hey.
I just thought it was such a kind of--
I loved how your points of reference
often were so kind of...
...almost like from your sort of...
...family connections were kind of
in your blood at times.
Just these little points of reference
like from an old man.
You're only what, 24, 25?
This muffin is...
I'm enjoying this immensely.
The muffin and your performance.
I was saying actually that one of the
great commentaries is Carpenter...
...and Russell on The Thing, drinking, smoking.
We're here drinking coffee and eating muffins.
Times have changed.
Do you know what you're having?
There's Feast.
Yes, he really played the dapper maitre d'.
How many days did we spend in L'Etoile?
We had two days. It's worth mentioning
this film was shot in 28 days.
And it was probably the most stressful
thing I've ever done in my life...
...because we didn't shoot it
like one of those lo-fi movies...
...where everything's hand-held.
- Not at all, no.
-It was very... A little more structured.
The first appearance of Dr. Friedkin.
Adam Freeman and foreign office-
Paul Freeman. Alan Freeman, not ours.
- And I think they're the same person.
- I love Paul Freeman.
Paul Freeman has, speaking of eyes...
...the most magical eyes
of any actor I've ever worked with.
It's very appropriate.
I love that line later in the film where you say:
"I was dreaming about an eyeball."
He turns, gives you a magical look:
"What sort of eyeball?"
There was a joke. We'll talk about it later...
...that we never did in the end because
it would have actually abused...
...the gift that is Paul Freeman's eyes.
Yeah. I've found-- I've trawled through hundreds...
Yes, getting a scene, you know, sat around a table...
...for nine minutes to work was quite ambitious.
There's quite a few things that we did
that everyone said, "Don't, don't, don't.
Don't try it. You're mad."
Like the reveal in the launderette with the face...
...and having a 10-minute scene in the
launderette at the beginning of the movie.
- Yeah.
- I mean in a restaurant.
And there's the Boulting Brothers
over Clare's shoulder.
- Oh, yeah?
- Now they've disappeared.
And now, this girl here...
<i>...just over Clare's shoulder was she in Hellraiser?</i>
I don't know, is she? Oh, is she the--? I don't know.
I think I can see lovely Michele Dotrice up there.
- There he is.
- Yes.
I'm doing nothing to dispel the myth
that I have ginger hair, am I? Really.
Well, we graded it slightly to be more forgiving...
...but she-- We went for the strawberry blond.
- Really?
- But depends on the light, it does go a little bit--
I look like a Weasley.
I look like the lost Weasley.
You do. Well, it's a shame they finished the series.
Maybe if they go back, we could--
I thought I should have
played Professor Lupin.
This death thing could take a while.
I love that. Lou Foley, who did the costume design...
...just made some fantastic choices.
I loved some of Jack's costumes.
Like an action figure. He had his going-out kit...
- Yeah.
-...with his long scarf and his cardi...
...and his pants and sweater.
And he also had his towel and his duffel, you know.
There were so many cool changes in this movie.
- There you go.
- She must've smoked 40 filterless fags.
Per day, yeah. So that was 80 altogether.
- She relished it as well.
- For the team. Yeah.
Little Johnny Rabbit is dead.
So is Timmy, so is the fucking hedgehog.
They're lying in the road...
I think our insurance people came in
to check up on us that day...
-...to see you losing it.
- Really, when I said "prickly"?
"Prickly cunt and that fucking
hedgehog lying in the road."
They let us get on with it after they saw it.
I look like faintly Roman there, it's like sort of cherub.
The reference in the script here
was she's kissing him goodbye...
...like a mother on the train platform.
- Yeah.
- You look like you had...
...this sort of Oedipal relationship. This is very good.
- These lovely--
- Nice hard cut.
That was a suggestion by Mick Audsley...
<i>...the editor of My Beautiful Launderette.</i>
- Oh, yes.
- He came in and said:
"You could crash the gears a bit more
in your edit, you know.
Bring the kind of state of Jack's
mind out more in the editing."
So we took some hard turns there.
I think one thing I'm really proud of about
this movie is that I think it looks beautiful.
Look at that. That's so nicely--
That's an old Chaudoir at work. Simon Chaudoir.
And also, you know, our wonderful
production design team...
...and your framing. You know...
...it was just every shot
is like a painting. It's great.
- I'm blowing your trumpet.
- Absolutely.
Chris Hopewell was really particular about this flat...
...and how it was basically...
...it had been this glorious Georgian building at one time.
Maybe even an embassy.
And it had been converted very badly,
very cheaply by the council...
-...why you've got banisters against a wall.
- Yeah, yeah.
And, you know, it could have been
quite a nice little Bohemian pad...
...but after Jack's wife had left...
...it has become basically a sort of stinking prison.
Also that he's like a child.
- I love that he's holding his toilet roll.
- Yeah, yeah.
He's like a lost child in there. it's like it's too big for him.
He's like a little boy trapped in a house.
Now, it's worth saying I actually did have a slash here.
- And I'm doing all my own--
- That's all your own stunts.
I figured, you know, it would be good
for my prostate and for the film as well.
Stop.
The hooded claw.
We talked about this before
we shot it in the makeup chair.
How are we gonna do this scene?
And it was all about cranking up
the panic to such an extent...
...that you're sort of verging on Shelley Duvall.
- Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
- And it really did.
We really made each other laugh just talking about it.
That's totally who I'm channelling
as I come into the room...
...is Shelly Duvall
on the cover of The Shining video.
I remember as a kid that kind of...
- Yeah, I stayed--
-‚Äúterrified despair on her face.
Yeah. I think it was ejaculating fear.
I like the way the eye-- I did do
a little banana in the corridor there...
...and I appear to change size.
I get smaller as I go down the corridor.
Yeah, we got like a 12-- 11 mm lens here.
Your mouth is just stretching open
and the pants look enormous.
What's this track?
This is The Pretty Things
from the first rock opera...
...and they're credited by Pete Townshend.
It's called "I See You" from the album S.F. Sorrow.
And thematically, it nails the film.
I think you strained your mouth doing that.
That was a lovely practical effect, that.
The eyeball, wasn't it?
It was put it in his mouth
and he wiggled it with his tongue.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Exactly. And I think it worked better,
if it had all been done with computers...
...it wouldn't have had the same claustrophobia.
I think there's a lot to be said for practical effects.
Yeah.
I think the whole thing of Jack's sort of...
...is we talked a lot with Chris Hopewell...
...about, you know,
the years leading up to making this.
Of his sort of--
His shabby chic and these bits of clothing...
...he's inherited from uncles and grandfathers.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know.
Yeah, that gown. it's--
We went through a few, didn't we?
Remember that day, I tried on a bunch...
...and that felt like the most fitting.
It felt the most loose.
There's the kids.
- Yeah.
- These guys are great.
They were great. They're very professional.
That girl was a big fan of Run Fatboy.
Yes, she was.
No, I can hear you perfectly well
from up here.
So I'm calling out of the window in--
You're crawling out the window in--
Near Hackney. And they're--
The kids are in Hackney and then
behind me, is in Shepperton, right?
Yeah. Absolutely. Seamless.
Actually, that dressing gown cost us a lot of money.
- Did it?
- Because we had to--
It was constantly getting ripped.
We had to keep stopping filming.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- People go off and start sewing it.
That's true. The time it took to sew up
that dressing gown-- Because it was--
It was threadbare and faintly sort of not soiled.
- But, you know--
- There was only one. There was no--
Usually you have doubles
of everything. Absolutely everything.
I had at least a hundred pairs of pants.
We had to change on an hourly basis,
due to seepage, leakage.
- Just heavy wear.
- Heavy, heavy soiling.
And basic friction.
That dog was a cutie.
Oh, here we have--
This is classic sort of indie filmmaking.
We were all shoved in this tiny little corridor in Islington.
And it was pissing down outside.
Yeah, this is the actual flat that you--
- You see outside.
- The kids are outside. Yeah, this is...
They were outside. There's his little fingers, look.
- I think I was doing the rings.
- Were you?
- You were talking to me
- You were going:
Yeah, exactly.
You were getting more and more annoyed with me.
In the end, it's quite fitting to say,
"Fuck off. Let me do some acting!"
That's one of my favourite lines there.
"I'm opening my flap."
God in heaven, will you just fuck off
and give me some peace?
There-- Things like slot and flap,
they're really fun to say.
I got to say them a lot in this film.
"Shove your slot in."
That kind of dialog, Phil, is very Bruce, isn't it?
That kind of odd specificities.
Hello?
Here she is.
This is about some surprise you get
when you make a film and you get laughs...
...you had no intention of getting
is when the reveal of Clare here.
Oh, Clare, doing her 0898 agent.
- Everybody--
-"You can chat and make friends."
Now, this is-- This apartment is actually--
We shot in the author,
Robert Temple's apartment...
-...in Red Lion Square.
- Yeah.
That is the apartment where Rossetti
and Burne-Jones lived together...
...and acquired syphilis.
- Get off!
- That's it. That's it.
That's the room where they painted
and exchanged...
-...addresses with prostitutes
- STDs.
But very fitting that it should be
Clair De Grunwald's apartment.
How did you come across that?
Well, because I knew the writer, Robert Temple.
And I spoke to him and said:
-"This is a great little room."
-"Can I use your Ô¨Çat?"
And the deal was, "As long as you don't show anything."
- Long as you don't show the syphilis.
- Yeah. We brought in.
What were those scripts that she had there?
Are they the classic...
...with the penned titles on the side.
I wonder if any of those have been made since--
- Yeah.
- Probably not.
We did have a bit of split screen here
for the conversation...
...but decided in the end it was--
You needed to get the fear by a closeup of Jack.
Yeah.
Clair's got her spider broach on there.
Clair is the spider in Jack's mind.
There. I love this little look you give here.
"There's no interest."
Oh, no.
Self-confidence sort of prolapsing here.
There's a lot of symbolism in the movie,
which is quite dense and complex.
And I hope-- I always hope
people kind of pick up on it...
...because it's, you know, just stuff
with eyes and with...
...you know, the idea of the cycle...
-...the various animals and fairy tales.
- Fairy tales.
I think, you know, we could go through
and do a pass and pick them out...
...but then, like you say,
you get the definitive commentary...
...and you've ruined it
for everyone else, for people who--
Now, this is a great little monolog
taken straight from the book.
I think it was the best use of voiceover
and live production sound...
...that we got. It was a great balance.
Yeah, we did-- Jerome played it over the thing.
And I-- Every time he says
"Humphries," I mouth it.
It's a nice little marriage.
And I talked to Michael Price. We were
putting the music together for this.
The whole idea was, you know,
absolutely go over the top...
...as far as don't be afraid to go
towards the melodrama.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So when he's, you know, Harvey...
...the great terrible import of that name--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wonder what Harvey Weinstein would think of this.
I'm sure he'll be delighted.
This is the first of Chris Hopewell's animations.
<i>--All night in the basement of
39 Hilldrop Crescent, N5, separating</i>
Here is the theatre that we built
and animated in Bristol.
Beautifully designed by Henry St. Leger...
...and animated by Claire Mitchell. Beautifully done.
The idea with this was to have
a very sort of 2D animation...
...very similar
to old Victorian theatres that you get...
...but animated in the style of Paddington.
He had animated cutouts.
If you're watching this for the second or even third time...
...it's worth looking around the flat.
There's loads of odd things.
Not just on the murder wall but on--
- There are loads of portraits of Jack--
- Yeah. Done by his wife.
Done by his wife that are kind of not very good.
And of them both, actually.
Catherine, his ex-wife, her spectre looms large in the flat.
- There you go.
- This is smart.
But you can't take your eyes off the pants.
- You can't take your eyes off my pipe.
- That's why we--
That's why we had to go
to black there because...
To get-- To draw focus away from the pants.
This actress is incredible.
She is very famous in Britain
for being in Dad's <i>Army.</i>
Of course. I love her makeup.
It looks her entire face is drawn on.
She came to the production, the office...
...and the makeup girl, Nadia Stacey, said:
"Look, she's done her own makeup.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna tell her?"
"Well, let me go and have a look."
And she turned the chair around...
...and presented this sort of clown.
And I said, "Don't touch a thing.
She's absolutely perfect."
You couldn't plan that.
You did a lot of smoking.
I do a lot of smoking, but they were all herbal.
I mean, Clare smoked pure tobacco, real thing.
Okay, okay. Be rational, be rational.
Speaking of Nadia and the makeup team...
...I should shout out to Laura Blount,
who put my wig on every day.
...and did this-- Probably one of the best
if not the best wig I've ever worn in a film.
I remember sitting with you when we
first went on and we were having a chat.
I couldn't see the join actually
just sitting across the table.
It was nothing to do with lights.
It just worked brilliantly.
It's a great piece.
It's slightly based on Peter Firth in <i>Equus.</i>
--Humphries is in fact Hawley Harvey Crippen's grandson
No more questions, Your Honour.
A little cheat there. I actually
stepped up on a box to get to the--
You know, I almost dropped
a B there. B for bollock.
And if you'll wind back and pause that,
you might even see one of my plums.
- There's a box of stuff. A box of instruments.
- There's a box of murdering weapons...
...which he's been collecting
and cataloguing for his research.
And once you see exactly
what he's surrounded himself with...
...you realise why he's gone off the edge.
--Expect the unexpected, mate.
I love the way that glue--
That sort of great glutinous ropes of...
The sound for this film
was all of that kind of production...
...special effects sound was all done
by this fantastic guy called Samir...
...who worked on Harry Potter...
...and came up with all of those
parseltongue and stuff like that.
"Just go for psychedelic horror movie
and just push it as hard as you can."
He did. Even with the glue.
This film has a number of links with <i>Harry</i> Potter.
Not least our wonderful producer,
Geraldine, but also-
I met Geraldine through <i>Harry</i> Potter
because I found a lost digital camera...
-...which belonged to the continuity girl.
- To Voldemort.
To Vold--
Pictures of Bellatrix Lestrange
in her underwear.
I'll tell you the story.
I walked out my mum's house.
Found a digital camera on the ground.
I picked it up, looked--
I said, "Right, if I look at the pictures,
I'm gonna see who it belongs to."
- And you might see some boobs.
- Yeah. Exactly. There weren't any boobs.
What there was is pictures of children
with bruises and scars.
It was rather disturbing. And I said,
"Oh, my God. What have I found?"
Then it was people in the woods in dark robes.
"Oh, my God, this is obviously a cult."
- Yeah.
- A sex cult for children.
And I was just about to call them up
and enquire about membership.
And it was-- And then I saw a picture
of Gary Oldman.
- My God, Gary Oldman s here
- Gary Oldman is in a sex cult.
Yeah. Then I found Ralph Fiennes.
No surprises there.
- And then I saw the Weasleys.
- No, not him as well.
Slowly, slowly it dawned on me. I called up the office.
<i>The whole cast of Harry Potter is in a sex cult for kids.</i>
- Amazing.
- Oh, God, if this gets out.
We should wind back and delete this stuff.
Eventually, our production office...
...was so happy that I found it
and hadn't notified the authorities...
-...they invited me to bring it in.
- To join the sex cult.
- That's how I met Geraldine.
- Wow, she's in it too?
She seems like such a nice lady.
I love this washing up.
I think we out-Withnail'ed here.
This kitchen was an absolute disaster.
I mean, beautiful in its design...
-...but a lot of it was practical rot.
- It was.
The fridge smelt like-- Jesus.
This was Method production design.
Chris Hopewell made sure everything
was real and was allowed to rot...
...and marinate for a couple of weeks
before we went on set.
We're doing a scene, I had to look in the fridge...
...which didn't make into the final cut.
I remember opening it was being...
Standing very near a mouldy something exploding.
Yeah. It was a bit like your reaction to the oven.
Yeah, and also-- It was.
There's Catherine's portrait, which he's done of her.
Catherine.
--Cigarettes. Certainly all food.
And so this is the first reveal of the shower.
- We do need a shower scene with a knife like that.
- A reverse shower scene. A reverse Psycho scene.
Thought it was quite neat that the knife attack's
from the inside of the curtain.
And then, there were a couple of little kind of...
...little tricks that we played on the audience.
The first one being that Jack has that knife
in his hand for the entire...
From the gluing the window right up
to this point and never lets it go.
This is the first time he realises that it's stuck.
He's so tense and wound up
that he's gripping it the whole time...
-...like he's clenching his teeth.
- Yeah.
- Well, that's the conceit and...
- That's my ass.
My foot goes in like a ballet dancer there.
It's like the first position.
And the other one is after-post burn...
...when we had to only shoot me from the one side.
- Oh, my God.
- Which was really hard.
That was the second day on my first film.
That was a bit of cling film full of blood in my hand.
Cut my fucking hand off?
This was a very intense take
altogether in a shower. We had--
I mean, I think Alfred Hitchcock
had 10 days to shoot his shower scene.
- Really? Four hours, yeah.
- And we had four hours.
I think the shot of my ass going into the scene--
That's my-- They're my feet.
That's right. I knew they're not my toes.
This shot of my ass,
because it's so sexually charged...
...was the moment the <i>Evening</i> Standard
critic threw his toys out.
There it is. From the inside out.
The classic rings.
Snap, snap, snap. There they are.
Did you go back and get that shot?
They didn't come off so sequentially.
Yeah. We had to redo it. You had to grab it.
There's so much at the end of the day, grabbing shots
with people running around, screaming.
I love this cut here.
Here he is sort of coming into the saloon.
- So Zen.
- Yeah.
This was one of my favourites.
This is probably my favourite scene in the movie.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can hide a knife in there.
So this duffel coat, this is the first time we see it...
...it's the reference to Peeping Tom.
Yes.
Which was a film that,
for all intents and purposes, ended...
-...Michael Powell's career in Britain.
- Yeah.
And is now considered his masterpiece.
Yeah. It's ridiculous. It just got
a 50th anniversary Blu-ray release.
Yeah, which was graded by Vince Narduzzo...
...with Martin Scorsese who graded our film.
- There you go. See?
- Vince, not Martin.
Obviously Scorsese wasn't available.
But it's-- Yeah, and I think what wound people up...
...apart from the pornographic undertones...
<i>...of Peeping Tom...</i>
...it was like having this sympathy for the killer.
They couldn't understand him as a human being.
I guess it's the same thing with Perkins...
...is trying to see him as a victim.
Yeah, yeah. Rather than just
some sort of manifestation of evil...
...which is easy.
This was a day-- This was a fun day.
I remember doing this.
The crew, like, just watching in horror.
- Yeah, with socks in their mouths.
- Yeah.
Well, I just had to go for it. I had to try
and do it as well as I could...
...because if you're trying
to undermine it with comedy, it's--
It won't be as funny, so...
No, you've just got to go for it
and be a white guy.
I had to throw myself under the wheels of gangster rap.
It makes it all the worse to watch. It's really...
I just-- I am one millimetre from laughing at that point.
<i>Smoking my Pipe!</i>
This is your little touch, which was great.
It's a mix tape for Catherine. I absolutely love that.
- That he's doing his--
- Like we all did.
Yeah.
I remember you me sent me, like,
almost a reading list of stuff.
But I mean, I want to re-borrow
a load of stuff, like NWA.
-'80s gangster rap.
- Yeah.
Also, some Cube I didn't have and...
Well, the exciting thing about music then,
it was a bit like punk...
...in that it was-- That music was happening...
...outside of the music business,
outside of the media, it was--
And it really was shocking. Really, genuinely shocking.
- That was exciting...
- Yeah.
...and it doesn't really happen so much anymore.
But, yeah.
That was the tragedy of his washing.
And the brief I gave to Michael Price
for this was, you know...
...fishing bodies.
Fishing bodies out of the Twin Towers.
- Did you?
- Yeah. He said, "Okay. I'll go for it." It's heroic.
Now, here we go.
At a children's party, oddly happening at night.
- Yeah. Well, it's winter.
- Of course.
Yeah. It was-- The kids were out, right?
My birthday was in January.
Somebody said that, like...
...I can't remember who it was.
Oh, yeah, but you're right.
It could be like 5:00 at night.
Now, here's the joke that we were gonna have with Paul.
And it was that we'd see him dressed
as a pirate with an eye patch...
...and then at the end of the film...
...he'd still have the eye patch, but not the hat.
So the idea was that he had an eye patch anyway.
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
Exactly. But, obviously, Paul--
- Paul acts so beautifully with his eyes.
- I know. It would be a shame to halve it.
I can't quite get across enough
how lovely Paul's eyes are.
I would get lost in them...
<i>.as</i> he <i>regaled me with stories
from Raiders of the Lost Ark-</i>
I'd lose concentration, listening to his Belloq stories...
-...because his eyes were so lovely.
- Yes, he's enchanting.
Actually, he played it so cool in the rehearsals as well...
...I thought, you know, he said--
The thing about Paul is that he's a fine actor.
Like a proper, just professional. I love--
He's so effortless. He does very little,
but it's all on-screen, you know.
He's brilliant.
Absolutely. When he sat down in front of the camera...
...he absolutely nailed it.
It's quite difficult dialog as well,
with that sort of psychological talk...
...and those kind of words about,
you know, your defence mechanisms...
...and the internal motivations, and blah, blah, blah.
I love the one he does with the vol-au-vent
at the end. It's a great long "anal hoarding."
There's only one way to say "anal hoarding,"
with a mouth full of pastry.
Exactly.
Like the way my bunny rabbit is straddling
the gun there like Cher just above my head.
--It cannot have been traumatic enough
to create such a phobia.
Another day in a very small room, that was.
- Yeah.
- There's a little <i>Timmy</i> the Tortoise...
...one of Jack's great successes over his shoulder.
Now, the books were put together by
the same people that did Potter, right?
- Exactly. They did the potions book...
- Yeah.
...and the Marauder's Map...
<i>...and the Wildwood.</i>
So here, this-- Coming up here
is a little flashback where...
...that used to start the movie...
...which we decided against in the end.
<i>--Of our mind. To your childhood...</i>
Friedkin is really more of a sort of wizard character here.
He's off, travelling at speed through the synapses.
- And Bernard Cribbins.
- Bernard Cribbins.
<i>The voice of The Wombles.</i>
- The voice of many childhoods.
- Yes.
Many a childhood.
That's so creepy.
- Yes.
- That's little Zaak, who played Young Jack.
Both our Young Perkins
and Young Jack were fantastic, I think.
Another Lou Foley triumph there.
My p.j.'s, which were specially made, I believe.
Did you have a happy childhood?
Yeah, we had to select-- The bunny
rabbit design had to be just right.
Now, I understand, as a small fun fact...
...that a Jedward video had been filmed at this house
not two weeks before.
So it really is an "all life is there" kind of situation.
It's just we hadn't got any money
on this film and we needed some way--
Couldn't afford another set.
We had to find somewhere
just outside Shepperton where--
So we could, you know, keep all the camera trucks...
-...and the makeup back at Shepperton.
- Nearby.
We would commute a few minutes
outside of Shepperton to this lovely house.
And the other proviso was that
a Jedward video had been shot there.
The criteria was very precise, but we found it.
Yeah, and I remember I took...
...Paul Freeman and Alan Drake to meet...
-...an eminent psychotherapist called Liza Elle.
- Yes, I remember. Yeah.
And they went and had a good chat.
And Liza's from Israel.
And so Paul studied her very carefully,
and was basically stealing her accent...
...observing her. But the way that she
would play around with the language...
...and break into anecdote, he got--
There's a nice little touch here with the--
Oh, I think he's gonna say "bananas."
I hope that comes across.
We used to laugh at this enormously, didn't we?
We've got, you know, like an Indian
sadhu there on the mantelpiece.
And those are the Indian mysticism
we had as our back-story...
...that as an eminent psychologist, Dr. Friedkin
had investigated the occult...
...and mysticism and transformation, Carl Jung...
...and spent a lot of time in India...
-...finding himself, losing his sense of humour entirely.
- Yeah.
He-- Chris Hewitt from <i>Empire,</i>
who was intrigued by all that stuff.
He was-- He-- I think he wanted
to ask you about it actually...
...because it's very prominent in this scene, obviously.
I guess the whole idea was that, you
know, a really good psychologist...
...in a way, is a bit like a shaman,
you know...
...because he's seeing somebody--
- He's seeing the deeper self.
- The inside, yeah.
And he's a little bit of a wizard.
He's standing between the worlds of life and death.
And the original name for this character...
-...was actually Dr. Freeman.
- That's right, yeah.
I thought Friedkin might be
a bit spookier, so I changed it.
- Paul Freeman came in.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- The same birthday as me.
- Really?
Yeah, and he's January the 18th, and he's--
- Paul Freeman or William Friedkin?
- Paul Freeman.
To experience your own death.
Do you remember Chunky, our camera
operator was so uncomfortable...
...doing that clunky zoom,
because it went against his instincts?
He said, "I know. It's so messy
I said, "But that's Italian."
- That's the point.
- Yeah, that's how they do it.
But I thought that was cool that he was--
- He was programmed to perform well...
- Yeah.
...and couldn't unlearn what he had learned, you know.
--Infantile fantasies.
- Dad?
But, basically, he has totally opened up Jack now...
...and given him a sort of seven years
of psychotherapy in four minutes...
-...which is impressive.
- Yeah.
- And they're still on the phone as well.
- Yeah. Yeah.
It's all happening internally.
And here we're back at Shepperton
on a big sound stage.
Yeah, he's stoked into--
Obviously, this is his childhood.
He's in the Weird Wood in that book.
The primary defence mechanisms you relied on
to get you through childhood no longer support...
I love this. Look at that dusty old Ô¨Çock
floating around in the background.
Again, this was all shot up at Shepperton.
But the amazing guys...
...Ben Foley, the guys at Big Bang
in Bristol, they built these...
...lovely sort of scenes behind,
which are all hand-painted trees.
They didn't build them. They built them in--
Built them on a computer kind of thing.
And then, it kind of--
The feel of it was along the lines of
something that Terry Gilliam might do.
Something that had a real stagey feel.
Something that looks like scenery.
Dr. Friedkin, I think it's time I faced my banana.
- Yes, this is the tool-up.
- A classic tool-up.
Parody, sort of Commando,
Schwarzenegger, Hot Fuzz...
-...and, you know, kind of laundry.
- I'm not in any of those.
This was a lot of fun, this whole sequence.
I love the Way in the trailer, that the shot of Brian...
...it wasn't Harold, nearly getting
run over was cut into that.
- That was a very smart edit.
- Yeah.
Motherfucker.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
I had a Walkman on, the iPod in my pocket...
...and I was listening to
"Wrong Nigga To Fuck With."
In every shot that you see me walking here...
...it's playing full volume in my ears, so I was--
I genuinely had the music in my head.
Yeah, absolutely, it was--
Like, this track was in the script from the beginning.
And we very nearly didn't get it. It was a real...
We had to deal with Ice Cube's crew.
- Really?
- And-‚Äî
He's nice, though. It's the people around him.
They're very mean. Ice is a lovely guy.
Ice is cool, but, you know,
but all those AK's pointing at you...
...negotiations can be pretty tense.
Now, this is little Vietnam in Hackney. We were, like--
We were doing it for real here.
That's a genuine gangster giving us evils...
...because we hadn't paid him protection money.
That was Eyebrows Johnson.
Here's another guy with that
bandaged hand and a thumb missing.
Another possible victim...
- And here's-- This is--
-...of the Vietnamese Mafia.
There's Pecker.
Now, those dogs there were--
- Real.
- Real.
No, they were like sensors.
You walked past, eyes glowed red, they barked.
They were like robot sentries.
Yes, this is a Vietnamese cash and carry...
...with incredible alarm systems.
Oh, I just got a real craving for pho.
Can you get pho around here? It's a nice soup.
- Oh, my God. I had some lovely pho in Prague.
- Really? Talk about that.
- In Little Hanoi in Prague.
- Go for it.
I watched the director's commentary for Das Boot.
- And I fell--
- I love you for that.
I fell asleep, woke up and they
were talking about being in Bangkok.
- Really?
- Which isn't in the film. So go ahead...
...talk about pho in Prague.
It's a very lovely soup I had.
<i>Keep it together, keep it.</i>
Now, where's this now?
- Supposed to be London Fields.
- We're in Wapping, are we?
But we're actually out near Brick Lane.
<i>We were filming in the shadow of the
News of the World building formerly.</i>
- As it was all kicking off.
- It was all kicking off.
Dark like Willy Wonka's
chocolate factory.
Absolutely. Helicopters now
would leave at sort of midnight.
Yeah, there was like one light on...
...which I think was Rebekah Brooks' office.
You could just see torches.
It was like Watergate.
Here we go now. We're out of the flat.
Spent a long time in the flat with Jack on his own.
These-- I mean, the idea, you know,
it was quite a bold decision to make...
...but we, you know, wanted to have
three very sort of theatrical acts...
...where you got three locations, and you spend a long--
You know, you spend, like, sort of
half an hour to 40 minutes in each one.
So this second act entirely in the launderette...
...was a little bit risky, but we went for it.
Of course now,
we're not revealing the side of his face.
No, we haven't seen Jack's right side.
No, left side. What was it?
One of the sides, we've not seen it
since the oven exploded...
...which is a long, long time if you think about it.
It was a pretty...
-...hefty ask.
- Yeah.
So now and again, you can just see the traces of red.
Yeah. Here's the guys.
Here we go. The ladies.
I love the fact she's got those sunglasses on.
That's in the book, actually.
He goes into the launderette, she's put sunglasses on...
-...so she doesn't have to make eye contact.
- Right.
<i>Looks like my lucky day.</i>
There's Tuyet.
It was her first feature.
Tuyet made me laugh so much. She was great fun.
<i>The atmosphere's easing a little. I'm blending in.</i>
Jacqui Chan there.
Same name as the famous kung fu martial artist.
Never see them at the same place at the same time.
There you go. So that's Jane Stanness there...
...Sheena, the punk rocker...
...and Caligula, Tamzin Griffin. Brilliant.
Jane is actually a comedy partner of Julia Davis...
...long-time collaborators they were.
Yeah, I met her when I was...
- Did you meet her in Bath?
-...In Bath.
A west country connection with this film.
A lot of people come from that part of England.
All the animation was done in Bristol, right?
I'm from Gloucester.
The relief in the music there from Pricey is lovely.
So again, you know, here we go.
We haven't seen the other side of his face.
So this was the second or third day
on the film, which was just like:
How many more problems
do you wanna give yourself...
...apart from the obvious? Where to put the camera?
You can't show the other side of your face.
In a room that we are in every part of, as well.
The camera moves around the entire launderette
so I have to stay away from that side.
But once you know, you realise-- This is a--
This is the frontal lobe shot.
She was-- She's actually a big star, Golda John, in--
- A big star in Nigeria. Nollywood.
- Is she?
- Is that true?
- Yeah.
- I love Golda.
- And she was great.
This was a great-- When we did--
When we had rehearsals, before we started shooting...
...it was fun when we had everybody.
Because the film actually opens up
into quite an ensemble cast.
You've got the launderette crew,
and the police...
...and the film crew to go with the police.
Yeah, we did a day with just the girls
in the launderette...
...and then next day, the police turned up,
like they'd come to bust the session.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They were all sort of full of energy.
It was like, "Who are you guys?"
Brilliant. She dropped all her T's.
What am I gonna do?
It's not gonna get washed, is it?
I love her bling.
We said we've gotta give her
a bit of bling to wear around her neck.
Found this fantastic jewellery that says "love."
And her phone, which is this awfully...
...bejazzled, gaudy thing.
This was in Hemel Hempstead, this interior launderette.
Good throw, Tuyet.
And that-- It was blacked out outside.
This was all during the day, what you see out there...
...is a black curtain making it look like nighttime.
One of the tricky things on the film
was to find a launderette...
...we could film in that was cinematic, had lots of space.
Most launderettes are quite small these days.
Yeah, and had a door at the back and...
Exactly. So, you know, it was amazing we found this.
We were so happy.
It was quite a nice-looking launderette...
...and we went in with Chris Hopewell
said "What are we gonna do?"
He said, "The people in the launderette
were thrilled we're gonna film there."
Chris went in with his art gang...
...and they just made it look really, you know, run-down.
And the owners, you know, weren't happy.
- Really?
- Well, it looked really nice before.
He really did great work.
This was a difficult little scene to shoot...
-...not having free reign of position.
- Also--
And it ended up being quite claustrophobic and tense.
Yeah. And Jacqui was like 4'1" and Tuyet was 6'8".
Chris Hopewell--
I love the way Jane plays Sheena as Welsh.
- Yeah.
- It's like she's militant Welsh.
Chris Hopewell made that jacket
himself for the film.--...
...with a sander.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Now, there's a full-on view of my face
which you can't actually see.
There are little tricks that you--
We Wanted people to think, "Have we seen his face?"
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You do see my face because you--
There's all the flashbacks with Friedkin.
And times where you move round
and then the camera changes position.
Yeah, it's a clever trick actually that you played.
And I think that when the audience look back on it...
...it's hard to remember--
It's a good one because you think,
"I really haven't seen it."
- I kept trying to tell Jane--
- Show her legs?
- Yeah-- No, to keep moping.
- Right.
She was being quite ladylike.
I said to her, "Come on.
Show us your knickers."
Here she comes.
This is her Bollywood entrance.
Amara.
Lovely Amara.
Yeah, we wanted her to come in and stop the traffic.
This is what I believe they call a
"Tomorrow Never Knows" sound-alike.
Yeah. Yeah, basically.
And we said-- We shot this scene
and had a lot of fun. She was--
Amara was laughing and Simon Chaudoir said:
"Well, you know, if it doesn't go well...
...we can always get a job doing
shampoo commercials in Bombay."
Oh, it's a-- You know, for Amara
as well, the line in the script is:
"The most beautiful woman in London
walks into the launderette."
And so she had to really kind of pull off--
- But A--
- Camp it.
She is unspeakably beautiful...
...but she doesn't sort of wear it
like she knows it, Amara.
You know, so I'm sure she was laughing...
...as she was doing that.
When I first met Amara, she was--
No, it was at a premiere.
But she can look very demure
with little specs and kind of student-y...
...and you wouldn't notice her walk by
and then she can do that.
"Jesus!"
Yeah, I was really happy with this little scene here.
- It was great fun.
- A nice little reflection.
Yeah, just the symmetry of those machines...
...and the "out of order"
over your shoulder and...
Getting this reveal to pay off
was risky as Well, but...
Yeah.
There was a line about a rum farm
that we just felt was a little bit, like--
Yeah, too-- It was in the first--
It was in the book and it was very funny.
It made Jack a little less sympathetic, didn't it?
It kind of made him sound a bit of an arse.
I love the line, "Swede's scrotum."
My head looks like a Swede's scrotum.
<i>No Wonder they've been Watching. They're justified.</i>
- I think it looks like out of Mad Max.
- Yeah- I know- Right.
What to do?
This is lots of fun here.
This is the first stuff we shot, wasn't it?
- This was like the second or third day.
- Yeah, this was--
This is-- I can't express enough
how fast we were shooting...
...and, you know, I guess if you're shooting on location...
...and you got hand-held cameras
and, you know, you just go, go, go.
- Yeah.
- When positioning the camera...
...and trying to really block it out and light it well...
-...you just become a nervous wreck.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Particularly when you're--
I mean, in a room like this which is stark...
Oh, this is great.
- Now, I did--
- You threw these.
I threw these pants. I was very proud of it.
We tried it and I had to take over. It wasn't happening.
It looks like Jane's had an idea about pants.
One of these shots
did hit Tamzin Griffin in the face.
Really?
And that's why she's sort of
firmly closing her eyes as it--
ls there a blooper reel? I'd love to see
Tamzin with pants on her face.
That's something like 2000 frames a second.
That--? We did the same thing
with the shot of me getting Tasered?
Yeah.
- The room was lit.
- It's called a photon, I think.
- Is it?
- Torpedo.
- I know all about this.
- Camera.
Love the way she's holding it up with pencils.
- Yes.
- Probably 2Bs.
Exactly. She doesn't wanna--
Yeah, I mean, she comes in
with an art folder so she--
I think the idea was she was at
Cambervvell Art College.
Cambervvell for obvious reasons.
It's embroidered inside on a little tab.
I love that he'd have his name
sewed into his pants.
Lent them to somebody, long time ago.
Not sure how they got into my wash...
Yeah, he's very good.
No. No, thank you.
He's really trying to be nice but he is
at his absolute wits' end at this point.
- Here we go.
- I love this.
- A classic knife-drawing sound effect.
- Absolutely. Yeah.
It's not what it looks like.
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
- I love--
- The first bit of hand-held in the film.
- Is it?
- Yeah.
- Jack constantly uses--
- It's turned to Carry On...
-...in the laundry now.
- Yes.
That was a good kick.
I love that Jack uses the fact that he's a writer as--
He uses it as an excuse, but actually
it just seems to incriminate him more.
It makes it worse to say that he's a writer.
So this is where Jane breaks out the Welsh.
L-- We missed that line, "He's got a blade."
Jane is Welsh. She's from Aberystwyth.
- That's right.
- And she's writing something...
-...in Welsh at the moment.
- In Welsh?
Comedy in Welsh.
I was very keen to have my shoe off at this point.
I thought it-- Just the kind of-- The vulnerability and...
The fact you're not wearing any socks.
Yeah, absolutely.
Look at that on the back, "Fuk."
That's Welsh for "fuck."
It's actually a punk band.
But it might as well have been Welsh for "fuck."
It's like they have words like "televisiog" is television.
"Fuk" with a K is "fuck" with a CK.
There must be another way out of here.
- And this is Jack realising--
- And this is--
We didn't play up the whole Christmas thing
We just had it on in the background-.
Yeah, it was supposed to be December.
Jack is so sort of out of touch with the world,
he has no idea that Christmas is going on.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It just happens to be happening.
I think we sort of left it like that.
I hope that this turns into a classic
Christmas movie, in a way.
Like Gremlins did.
Or films that aren't really about
Christmas but take place at Christmas.
<i>"Oh, it's Christmas. Let's watch
Fantastic Fear of Everything.</i>
Get ourselves in the mood."
There he is, Simon Kunz, who I've worked with...
<i>-...on Spaced, on Hippies.
- Brass Eye.</i>
<i>Brass Eye.</i>
And our team of extremely violent coppers.
And it's the blending of the ages as well.
You've got sort of traditional, sort of late '80s copper...
...with sort of nova-cops...
-...sort of Tasered and...
- Yes.
...machine gun wielding.
I can't see him. Dryers clear, sarge. Dryers clear.
Okay, there's Henry...
...who plays, of course, the bully-type character...
<i>...in The Inbetweeners.</i>
And Anna.
- Anna came in at the last minute...
- And Jay.
-...to play WPC Taser.
- Yeah, Anna was at the last minute.
She did that bit when she had to step
on my face and going, "You wanker."
"You pervert, that's what you like to do?
Frighten women, is it? Yeah?
Getting the pants out?"
You had her riffing, but the stuff that
came out of her mouth was frightening.
No mumbo.
- Be my guest.
- Tase him.
Grunt.
Look at this. I love that lovely little
smile on her face like she's loving it.
She's been tortured--
He's been tortured by women basically.
This whole film is about a guy--
It's like a reverse <i>Fifty</i> Shades of Grey,
isn't it? The whole thing.
That's a lovely shot.
And I love this version
of "See You In My Dreams" <i>as</i> well.
The original idea was to cut it
to "I'll Be Home for Christmas."
- That's right.
- Which proved to be so expensive...
...that ingenuity had to sort of take over...
...and we came up with this idea of this song.
Music clearance is a nightmare. It's such a pain. It just--
It hampers so much filmmaking sometimes...
...when you really want a track that will make a scene.
- Open a movie, make a scene.
- Yeah. Although, this-
I love this music. It's a beautiful version
and I'm glad it happened, but--
Henry Broadbent, the Hammond maestro...
...told me about this girl singing
in a tea house in Spitalfields...
...and I went to see her and she did
an incredible Edith Piaf impersonation.
- Yeah.
- And I just thought, let's try it.
So we recorded this version...
...and it really brought the scene to life.
Which is on the soundtrack of the film as well...
...which you can get in all good
record shops and on the Interweb.
Look at his little face.
I've had a couple of people
play the young me in the past...
...and I like-- I think this little fella is the best.
Zaak.
Zaak Conway.
Just to get his name across.
Yeah. A big shout out to Zaak.
A big shout out for Zaak Conway.
This is Chris'-- The old touch here.
This is lovely, the way that his face turns into mine.
Oh, God. Anything with kids now just breaks my heart.
Yeah, once you got a kid,
it all starts to get super-loaded.
- It does.
- And...
That transition is lovely.
And they're very similar sort of facial-
Yeah, it's the right sort of profile.
Okay, this was shot at 3:00 in the morning.
Now-- Yeah, that's the <i>News</i> of the World
building looming behind.
You can't quite see it there, but...
Now, this girl who--
- She was a natural nurse, wasn't she?
- Was she?
I was trying to get Morag to do it.
Morag Webster, who is the nurse...
...who has looked after my health since I was 28...
...and has done everything I've ever been in.
And I wanted her to do this part but she wouldn't do it.
This girl was great. Yeah, I know, she...
She was too busy beating me
at "Words with Friends."
We had a long...
We had a bit more of a rant here which we cutout.
Had to get on with the story.
A bit more of a rant about beat cops
and these reality cop shows.
The kind of the-- The idea of the reality cop show...
...was slightly sidelined in the end, wasn't it? It didn't--
It was a layer too far
as far as getting in the way of the story.
It might be on the deleted, will it?
There'll be a bit of deleted scene with these girls...
...because they've been chatting up PC Taser.
Oh, yeah, they were going back
for a threesome later on.
I look like I've gone all floppy here.
This was like one of the last things we shot, wasn't it?
There it is. That helicopter came in
especially for the shoot.
- Thank you, the police.
- Thank you.
- They were coming to arrest members of <i>News International.</i>
- All that goodwill with Hot Fuzz.
And they thought they'd help us
shoot a scene on the way.
It was very nice. They were just
picking up some of Murdoch's lot.
"Take you in for questioning."
Now, this is very smart. This is Simon, my stunt double.
The old switcheroo.
And that very neatly...
...switches into me.
And there it's me. That's a beautiful little join.
I love filmmaking for that, that you can--
Several people involved in one moment
and you don't see the join.
You'll never know
unless you listen to our commentary.
Yeah, and ruin it for everyone.
There's the Keystone Kops, they're off and--
The idea that you never know, you know, maybe I--
I watched this and I thought,
maybe Amara should be the killer.
You know? Maybe we should twist-- Tip it on its head.
Reshoot the movie, but no. We'll stick with the--
I think this is the first ever sort of psychotic...
-...community support police officer.
- You're probably right.
I love the way that Sangeet as well
is dressed in her red coat...
...like she's the ladybird. You know, all these things...
-...you know, they all mean something.
- And she's kind of alive.
Everyone else is dead in these muted colours.
Yeah, yeah, and she's like this shining beacon.
There's actually a bit of taste there.
A bit of taste for life.
I love my long scarf.
And we also missed the bit
when Henry calls me Paddington.
Which I just love. "What are we
gonna do with Paddington, sarge?"
This duffle coat's made by Gloverall...
...as worn by Klaus...
<i>...in Peeping Tom.</i>
This was Alan Drake's first day on the
film and a first day on a movie, in fact.
Alan Drake. There's the rest
of the commentary taken care of.
Let's talk about Alan Drake.
Alan Drake worked with my brother Jason...
...on some fringe work in theatre,
and he's absolutely brilliant.
I thought, this guy is very funny
and very real and very charismatic...
...why is he not working?
And I spoke to him afterwards...
...it's because he spent half the year
on sort of coach tours.
Yeah, well, he'd graduated from Central...
-...a prestigious drama--
- LAM DA-.
I know it was a very prestigious drama school...
...and decided being a sort of realist that he would--
- Never work.
- Do tour guiding as a sort of sideline...
...and it became his primary occupation
and, you know, he's--
And if you look to your left
you'll see the Grand Canyon.
He goes all over and one tour
is a Jack the Ripper tour...
...which he took myself, my wife
and my in-laws on one night...
...and he's fantastic at it and he does really well.
And he just kind of like was making money with that
so hadn't really done much acting, you know.
He wasn't available for six months of the year.
So nobody could contact him anyway.
I got an e-mail from him the other day...
...when he'd seen the film going, "Hey,
I'm back in town." "Oh, there you are."
This is a little bit of a nod to Manhunter.
Which very few people get.
It's a-- This is a brilliant version of it
by the incredible Bongo Band.
Have a nice day with your soap.
And I-- I mean, the idea is that Jack's really propelled...
...by his writer's curiosity
and a kind of intuition that his destiny--
He can't not investigate it.
I was quite sad that the--
That was a long cool shot that...
Going into the thing,
it was quite drawn-out, wasn't it?
Obviously, for timing, sometimes you--
These things have to go but there was--
The first take we did good.
Our focus pullover was bummed...
...that one bit went soft but you were like, "it's good."
Yeah. Yeah, no, this scene originally
Was about another minute longer but-
And it was gratuitous and I loved it...
...but we did have a few fights about
bringing the film under 100 minutes.
Because the three-hour cut,
you know, was a little bit--
Well, you know, I mean, we don't do it for them, do we?
- Yeah.
- We don't do it for the audience.
- I love those butchers' flaps. Brilliant.
- Yeah, it's grim.
<i>It's very Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>
But it's all happening in a launderette.
I think this is what worked for me...
...is this juxtaposing all of this horrific tragedy...
...with this ridiculous scenario.
The notion of a three-act structure is,
you know, obviously, a known thing...
...but this film has three definite sections.
And you have the flat,
the launderette and the basement.
And it's very talky and, you know, it's--
We're trying to get the balance between
doing something that's theatrical...
...but at the same time pulling lots of,
you know, nice, cinematic techniques...
...and having some, you know,
great sort of visual moments.
Again, this is Chris and his team
put together this fantastic basement.
And I love that, the space hopper just peeking out.
It's the first little bit of a clue that this
is not your normal laundry basement.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Somebody has been here.
Perkins' bedroom.
Can you imagine Perkins bouncing
around on a space hopper?
- I know. It's tragic.
- On his own.
He is a very sympathetic character.
There's something kind of tragic.
A couple of people said...
...he reminds me of Paddy Considine
in <i>A</i> Room for Romeo Brass...
...in that it's like this character
that's so kind of memorable...
...you think "Where's he come from?
I've never seen him before.‚Äú
He kind of-- I think Alan's great.
He's from a similar part of the world as well.
Yeah, that sort of accent he's got.
What is--? That sort of, you know-- Yes.
Oh, now, the first time Amara did this...
...she bit my bottom lip so hard...
...I couldn't scream because the sock was in my mouth.
And I was trying-- I was going...like this
and it tingled for two days.
- She literally bit my bottom lip.
- She thought she had hold of a sock.
She thought it was a sock and it was my
actual human lip. And it really hurt.
In certain parts of the world,
I'd have to pay for that kind of pain...
...from a woman that beautiful. But it wasn't pleasant.
They're both looking at the short side of the frame here.
- It's all very stretched out.
- Yeah. Yeah.
We've been abducted
by a psychopath whose intention...
See, there's a moment of elation here...
...for Jack because he's finally solved a crime.
- He knows he's right. It's not just paranoia.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- This really is happening.
- It's a validation of all his crap.
- It's like, "I'm right!"
- Simultaneously terrified and thrilled.
He kind of relaxes slightly, I think. You know?
It's almost like a relief to him
that his fears were founded, you know?
I mean, he does start to lose it.
Yeah. He's getting-- He's high, he's revelling in it.
This was three days? More?
In this basement tied up?
Yes, all the crew were grumbling
because it was really dusty.
They thought there was asbestos
in the air and there wasn't.
Me and Amara were tied like,
in a really uncomfortable position.
God. The crew didn't know, they were bored.
There was no moaning from you guys. Grumbling crew.
You don't get moaning from us.
This is a great entrance by him.
Great little scene coming up
with you and Alan and Amara.
I remember telling...
...Alan about how we were gonna play this...
...and the idea that, you know,
actually he's really thrilled...
-...to have some friends down to play in this room...
- Yeah, yeah.
...he's spent his whole life alone in.
Like he's got company.
I always had to think this was
Uncle Monty coming up the stairs.
But it's Alan coming down.
- What's going on down here, then?
- Oh, mate.
I love the mate-iness of it.
Even after they realise he's a serial
killer and I start calling him Tone.
- Yeah.
- I love that.
And the little-- The kind of--
The turning point in this act,
in their relationship with him...
...is once they know his name, they know who he is...
-...and then they have a chance.
- He becomes a human.
He allows himself to become a human.
I always wondered what it would be like
for an audience member...
...who didn't know what was gonna happen to--
How chilling this scene is, you know,
thinking that he is gonna kill them.
Must change the dynamic by quite a lot, you know.
You've got a character there
you don't know very well in Sangeet...
...who could seem, you know, expendable.
Absolutely.
"No, they won't kill Jack,
but they might kill her and it would--"
You know, the tension must, I would hope get quite high.
Look, he's thrilled. "Hey, look, let's play."
And also the idea is that Perkins
has been rehearsing these monologs...
-...to himself for months.
- Yeah, yeah.
And now he's got his moment, he's got the stage...
...and he's gonna start, you know, grandstanding.
Also, Jack's realisation...
...that the criminal stare he saw in the street was real.
Absolutely. Now, this moment here,
I remember in the questionnaires...
...in one of the test screenings,
the question was:
"At what point did you realise
Perkins was dangerous?"
And somebody put "When he
stroked the washing machine."
As Mahatma Gandhi said, "There's more to life..."
The colours in this scene are great.
When the light's off, everything's deep red...
...and there's that one green light flashing.
But the way that's registering on Alan's face...
...was done cleverly with a light you can't see.
Yes. Well, here we go.
Here's the great, the evil genius of Tony Perkins.
I love that he's got his little water bottle in his...
Actually, there was one scene where he had a--
When he pulls out the key, says "I've got the key"...
-...he pulled out a packet of Polos.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.
And we were gonna use it,
we couldn't get the Polos cleared.
- Bloody hell, Polo.
- Polo, really.
What's wrong with having this'?
Serial killers need fresh breath too.
Jeez, wake up.
- Takes all sorts.
- I love all this--
He's monologing here and he keeps messing up.
He bumps into something and he
gets his leg caught on some tubing.
- He did this very, very well.
- Yeah.
My mum came down to visit the set
in Shepperton on this day he did this...
...and she knew Peter Sellers really well...
...because he'd worked with my dad
lots and lots of times...
...and she said he had a little bit
of Peter Sellers about him.
Especially that moment, you know.
Crispian's mum is Hayley Mills, if you didn't know.
Our national treasure.
I love the colour-- The grade on that shot's nice...
...because it looks bleak and scary. But it didn't before.
You brought the blues up or something, right?
Yeah, we tweaked-- That's Vince Narduzzo.
Make it look like a flashback
without looking like a flashback.
Why are you doing this?
It's complicated.
And you can see Grandma right in the shot there.
You can see the back of her head.
That is, before the whole
neighbourhood went to Pot.
Pol POL
I wonder how many people know who
Pol Pot is among the younger generation.
My brother was teaching--
My brother's younger than me, in his early 30's.
He went to teach some kids in the East End.
He was teaching them drama and he--
- A lot of them hadn't heard of Gandhi.
- Really?
Hadn't heard of Martin Luther King,
hadn't heard of Hitler.
- He was just like, what--?
- Well, that is a tragedy.
- They've heard of Simon Cowell.
- Fuck.
- Which is nearly as bad.
- Although to say...
...a friend of mine in America, her son
went to a party dressed as Gandhi.
He chose to. And he was only, like, 8.
So there's hope for us all.
--When the light goes red, you're dead.
Absolute genius. Criminal mastermind there.
He was really happy with that line,
Perkins, in the mirror.
That will really fuck them up.
That's Jack's...
...lone shoe centre stage.
And those implements on the wall as well.
The rinse is ending.
I had a friend who's now moved to Rio...
...who was a sound engineer who worked in Hackney.
And he actually worked
in a sound recording studio...
...that backed onto a launderette
protected by the Vietnamese mafia.
- Really?
- Which is where the idea came from.
For real. And he was always
talking about rinse-out crew.
Saying "I went round to my
friend's house, rinsed out his fridge."
And so I just put that line in really for him.
The rinse is ending.
I was abandoned in a launderette as a child.
Yeah. And we were talking about the--
The laugh that becomes a cry. It's a tricky one.
- Yeah, what--?
- You nailed it well.
What was the film that we were talking about that--?
You sent me a clip of it.
- Oh, the best one is Richard Burton.
- Yeah, that's right.
<i>- Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
- Right.</i>
Which is-- Because I will,
"Don't do it like this but here--"
Yeah, this is an example of.
I remember reading about that.
Richard Burton was saying
he wanted to find his way to do it.
Because Larry Olivier had done
it his way, and he was like:
-"Don't wanna copy him."
- Yeah.
You gotta find your own groove, but it's a tricky one.
Look at that Vietnamese pop star.
- And here he is.
- Here he is. An actor prepares.
- Yeah.
- Well, the idea...
...is that Perkins is terrified.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, he's got performance anxiety.
We don't know this yet,
but this is his first kill, you know.
He's pumping himself up.
--On herself, not on you.
This is a nice little scene here.
- This little two-shot.
- It's a nice shot. Yeah.
And again, you know, we didn't realise--
Again, we had to shoot you
with half your face covered.
Yeah.
Because I had the big bandage on at this point.
And then in the midst of it all, a little bit
of romance which is super sweet.
It's a very intimate little scene.
I remember when she went-- She left the scene, it was--
We did this scene and then
we did all the stuff in the apartment.
- Went to the flat.
- We were missing Amara.
- Yeah. I did miss Amara.
- No girls on the set.
In the front of the camera.
Just you talking to yourself in your pants.
Well, I just spent, you know, three days
on the floor with a lovely lady.
- Tied up.
- Tied to a lovely lady...
...and then she was gone.
- It was--
- A big shout out to Joey Tempest...
...and the boys from Stockholm.
That they let us use this track.
Is it true that a thousand copies were
released of "The Final Cuntdown"?
Is that an urban myth?
A printing error.
Here he comes with his flashing glasses.
We-- I knew these glasses existed,
but we couldn't find them anywhere.
So Lou got a genius in Bristol to make those.
Yeah. My brother had some when--
We made a video called "Buggeroff the Bad."
It was about a Terminator-style android
called Buggeroff...
-...and he had those glasses.
- Right.
They don't make them anymore.
It was very fucking hard not to laugh at Alan...
- Yeah.
-...when he was doing this.
To stare at him blankly as he was rocking out was--
It was a big ask.
This is top-notch. This is classic...
He listened to it a lot.
At the after wrap party for this film...
...Alan Drake did a spectacular air guitar mime.
- Yes. It's on video, isn't it?
- To the whole--
- No, it-- That should go on the DVD.
- It's very rowdy, though.
It's-- People were hallucinating with excitement.
That was a big fun wrap party, that was.
It was nice, everybody there
had been involved in the film.
Sometimes there's people you don't know.
Everyone was dancing round in a circle. It was great.
It's important to know with this film as well,
a lot of people did two or three jobs.
You know, I was writing it, directing it,
writing the music, doing a lot of stuff.
Chris was production designing
and animating, et cetera, et cetera.
I've known Alan for years.
It was a very, very tight little group, so--
And, yeah, and also, something that I think
people never really get to see...
...when they watch a film is the process of making it.
People only see the product
when it comes to filmmaking.
Which is the result of what you've done.
It's not what you've done. And the kind of--
The process is such an important thing.
You have to enjoy the day-to-day creative process.
And on this job, we were so sort of challenged...
...and working so fast. It was one
of my favourite ever jobs, I think.
This was your bedroom?
"Touch it, touch it, touch it."
He reminds me of Paddy there.
Yeah. That was-- "Let me touch it, Tony."
This kid...
-...is brilliant.
- Oh, this is great.
He kept looking at the camera.
In the end, we let the camera roll,
told everyone to shut up.
Suddenly this magic happened.
He looked at the camera and that was it.
That was Perkins. Very frightening grandma.
- Yeah.
- She's brilliant.
She's actually French.
- Belgian French.
- Oh, look at that finger.
- Fantastic finger work.
- Amazing.
She's got the longest finger in Northern Europe.
And this boy, by this point, was generally wary...
...of maybe she was gonna push him down.
It was a very, very deep cellar as you can see.
<i>And I was allowed out...</i>
And again the lovely circularity
that Perkins had been there when Jack was there.
And the whole notion of the cycle,
the circle completing itself.
There's a neatness to the narrative in this film
which I think is very smart, Crispian.
-"Tone."
- Cast iron. Yes, "Tone."
The ebb and flow of this scene is interesting...
...because at this point,
they're kind of winning, you know?
- Yeah.
- They've undone his big opening act.
- Now he's on the back foot a little bit.
- Basically--
They get him against the ropes.
The only way out for him is to pull the knife.
Yeah, yeah.
Any mother, even a twisted...
And this actually-- This is authentic psychotherapy here.
Which is he's telling him,
"Look, we all cling on to these ideas that--"
- Yeah, yeah.
- Even a terrible mother is--
It's better to be attached to that than have no one.
- Be alone.
- Yeah.
I'm conducting the whole thing like an orchestra.
I'm like the Andr√© Previn of serial killers.
Andr√© Previn had fantastic hair.
I remember him as a kid doing those Panasonic adverts.
- Who? Andr√© Previn?
- Yeah.
That's my introduction to him.
I am an artist, aren't I? I'm like a sculptor...
The "sculpting in crime"
is a little reference to cinephiles...
...who've bought Tarkovsky's Sculpting <i>in Time</i> book.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that's the kind of reference I like.
Sounds like two Vietnamese gentlemen...
Here's me doing a racially dubious accent.
"Can I give you a handshake?
I give you handshake."
No regard for social responsibility there.
- Well--
- I apologise.
- The test was Tuyet found it funny.
- Tuyet did find it funny.
She was appropriately amused.
And this, now again, we--
The tide goes back towards--
In Alan's favour. I love this shaky cam as well.
-It's horrific.
- This is basically--
This is a very elaborate method.
- What you do is you bang the camera with your fist.
- Yeah. And it really works.
- The idea, the brief here--
- David the Bowie knife- I love that joke.
He's telling me to do it.
The brief here with the sound effects
was that, you know, we're basically--
We're in a Lancaster bomber about to crash:
Now, this-- That recurring noise...
...is as I learnt from you, the Shepard Tone, right?
A never-ending ascension.
Yeah, like a barbershop spiral is an optical illusion.
- Yeah.
- The Shepard Tone is the aural...
...with an A-U not an O-R equivalent...
...where two notes are going--
One note's going up, the other down.
As they cross over, it creates
this illusion that it's never-ending.
And this brilliant guy--
There's a scene here that--
There's a shot here that's pretty unnerving.
- That's not nice.
- No.
This turned out really-- This brilliant stunt girl.
She banged her head going in.
That's what I was worried about in that scene.
No way of breaking your fall.
Your head's gonna go first. Well done, you.
And thanks for making the scene look good.
- And sorry about the hospital bill.
- Sorry about your nose.
Absolutely.
And the classic sort of thing of him
not taking any responsibility.
- He's like, "I'm sorry it has to be this way."
- Yeah.
- This was frightful.
- That kick.
There's a muttering which gets lost...
...which is Perkins says,
"I've gotta tie up my loose ends."
- Oh, really?
- So kinky.
It's a story to end the cycle.
We were tied up with bits of tights.
And they really do cut into your hands.
It's actually-- Yeah, they were socks.
- Oh, yeah.
- And then they turned into cravats.
We thought maybe we should start wearing them...
...and start a little trend
down on Brick Lane. Might catch on.
The sock round the neck? Oh, yeah, everyone's doing it.
No, we came up with this on the day,
didn't we? The false flashback.
- Yeah, here we go.
- The drift.
And once upon a time...
Yes. Yes.
Now, there was a big headache.
How are we gonna transition from this set...
...into the fairytale?
And we explored...
...various ideas with lighting and all sorts.
Then Chris came up with this fantastic idea...
-...of the woods and the pipes.
- Yeah.
And we shot this little camera move,
and then in Bristol...
And here he comes.
Here comes Brian.
Look at him.
He does, he lives in the cave. This was all--
We built these magnificently huge sets.
These are kind of like 15, 20 feet across in a barn...
...just outside Bristol.
I used to cycle out there every day...
...and spend my day with these two characters.
Brian's the first character.
He's kind of modelled on Perkins, the community cop.
And he was animated by a guy called Joe and...
We decided to have two different
animators for the characters...
...so they had
different kind of feel to them, really.
But yeah, his environment
is kind of spooky and fairy tale-ish.
<i>Brian received an unexpected visitor.</i>
Creepy deep woods.
<i>--And I'll scratch your eyes out.</i>
It's great fun to do. Great fun. I thoroughly enjoyed this.
And here comes Harold,
who's modelled on Simon Pegg.
You can kind of see the resemblance,
I think, when you look at him.
He's a bit small, a bit gingery looking and that--
So we tried to model his hair.
It was-- The hair--
The puppets were made by a girl
called Ash who did a brilliant job.
And we modelled them on-- Like I said, the two actors.
Look at those stars in the background.
Aren't they twinkly?
But we-- Yeah, on the scenes that
we constructed, we brought loads of--
As you can see in the background.
It's like live moss and trees and...
You can even see, if you watch...
...insects and beetles kind of crawling around.
<i>--Chased him into the trees
over the dells...</i>
This is the bit where we change into the next scene.
That's not a real snail, by the way.
No animals were harmed
in the making of this, I might add.
Just lots of Plasticine.
Here we see that Harold's escaped.
And he's sneaked off down another way.
Brian is marauding the woods, crushing bugs.
Oh, here's some nice--
Nice mist effects, the-- A lady called Virpi.
She did these on glass and then we overlaid them.
And this was the only special effect that we really used.
Any overlay anyway, on this animated sequence.
The rest of it was all done in camera.
What I love about this little piece of animation...
...is the fact that we did really try
to channel Oliver Postgate...
...in the way the puppets were made,
the way they're animated.
It has a really sort of simple--
A really simple, naive feel to it.
You can see that the arms are made
out of wire covered in cotton.
And it's old sackcloth
to make the puppets, and bits of fur.
And it's nice that we see them boil and fizz a little bit.
It just gives it that really organic feel
that I think that Postgate had.
And that charm.
And that nostalgia is kind of necessary...
...for what this animated sequence does in the story.
It kind of builds a bond between
the two characters in the basement.
Lovely background sight there. Painted by Holly Jo.
And beautifully photographed by Jon Davey.
And of course marvellously DoP'd by James Lampard.
Brilliant work there.
Really kind of channelling the old sort of '70s animation.
Amazing. There we are, back down.
Yeah. Great transition.
I loved this little moment here.
- It's such a post-coital--
- Glow.
Glow that he has. Like--
But he's finally-- He's solved the mystery of his own life.
- Yeah.
- He can die now without fear.
Because he's been through it.
Perkins climbed down now from his ridiculous position.
And she's just very happy to see these two getting on.
And he's still got the knife as well, which is kind of--
The threat is there. He hasn't let go of the knife yet.
- But Jack's completely fine.
- Jack's fine.
Jack hasn't got the knife anymore.
It's been passed on to Perkins.
Jack's like totally without fear now. He's like--
It doesn't even matter if he gets stabbed now. He's fine.
He's been through death...
...he's come out the other side. What does it matter?
I love the fact that he actually ends up...
...being just a guy who cutoff someone's fingers.
Nothing sinister about it.
"Yeah, I did do that." Yeah.
- But it's still kind of weird.
- Yeah, yeah.
- He's wrong.
- He's still a...
- He needs some help.
- Yeah.
I found her in a bin outside Topshop.
- Shout out there for Topshop.
- Yeah.
I can see Sue Perkins poking around
in a bin outside Topshop.
- It's only appropriate.
- Sue Perkins?
Poking around in a bin? Oh, I see.
We're the same.
Look.
- Yeah.
- Just slight look at the knife.
And Alan absolutely hated that moustache.
- He hated it. Desperate to take it off. He kept saying...
- He didn't like it.
...he wasn't getting any because of it, sorts of things.
There was no-- I wouldn't hear it. I wouldn't hear it.
But the fact is, you know, I'm sure that
a lot of casting agents are gonna say:
"Make sure he brings a moustache."
Because it suits him.
Reminds me when we cast
Timothy Dalton in Hot <i>Fuzz.</i>
We insisted. We actually drew a moustache
on his 10-by-8s and said, "Look, it looks good."
Now, that is Gary Golding...
...who ran the Barnes video shop.
- DVD shop. Sorry.
- That's right.
I used to chat with him.
Really sort of hub of the community.
He said "Extra in your film."
"Give you better than that."
- He became the hedgehog himself.
- And he pulled it off.
That wig is-- There's Keshava.
That's your-- The fruit of your loins.
This actually was the last day.
I remember Bea, our second...
...when she saw me in that wig kept freaking out.
Because I'd spent the whole shoot looking like mad Jack.
Then on the last day, I was trimmed down.
They trimmed my wig, they trimmed my beard.
And I look kind of comparatively normal.
Although I think this wig
is less convincing than the other one.
- Yeah.
- You can sort of see the join a little bit.
Congratulations. Perfect synthesis
of Jungian and Freudian thought.
- There he is.
- This line here, he--
--whilst acknowledging the important role
that the false self played in surviving...
This was literally the final hours of the shoot.
We were running out of time and oxygen...
...getting this line about anal hoarding.
And the pressure was immense.
Actually, I think I had
a brain seizure on the last shot...
-...didn't know what to do.
- We did this cheat...
...when I whisper something to Sangeet.
It was like-- I said to Sangeet--
Actually I'm not gonna tell you what I say.
- Leaves it open.
- It's too obscene.
It solved the problem of how we got out of the room.
- There's Kerry Shale.
- Yeah.
Kerry Shale as Crippen's ancestor.
- A descendant.
- It's so--
His first outfit that he had was just like--
- It looked like he was G-A-Y.
- He was David Gest.
On a Friday night. Like he had nipple rings or something.
- We toned it down a bit.
- We had to tone it down.
- I think it says enough.
- That was...
...Lou just having a slight meltdown
at the end of the shoot.
Yeah. He--
But you can believe that he's got
a dungeon. That's for sure.
Him and Clare would absolutely piss
their pants laughing at this bit as well.
<i>And what about the little frightened hedgehog?</i>
There-- This is the shot where I actually-
I had a moment where I didn't know
where to put the camera.
Didn't know how we were gonna get it,
end of five weeks.
Well, we had to facilitate a move, didn't we? And...
- You said, "I'll just do that."
- I said, "I'll say this to Sangeet.
She'll listen to me. I'll back out.
We can keep the camera this side.
- And we can all go home."
- Yeah.
Absolutely.
- His horrible little wave.
- There he is.
Creepy fingered wave.
- And--
- We got a few people in that crowd.
Is Geraldine in there somewhere?
- She shook your hand.
- Oh, yes.
Another producer. Here we are at St. Paul's.
- And the--
- The last morning.
You notice on these buses, you'll see a few little clues.
And here, obviously the sign,
the London Life headline which we'd--
An idea we'd had earlier, to have
Jack's other suspicion confirmed.
Which is the maitre d' at L'Etoile was a murderer.
And the criminal stare was true.
Look at this-- Oh, there's-- Psycho's on the bus.
- Nice.
- And you got--
Harold the Hedgehog is also
on the bus. We see-- Now this is the--
I'm not gonna spoil it for anybody...
-...but obviously this--
- Now there's my assistant, Claire.
Claire Finbow. A big shout out.
She's the adult, obviously. I don't hire children.
I'm not part of a child sex cult like Crispian.
And there we go. There he is in his new incarnation.
- This is a great--
- Reformed, and--
Is this you playing here?
Yeah, this is me and Harry Broadbent and some...
Big G. Patten there. Our lovely producer.
- Orchestral shizzle.
- This is great.
And here's Gary. He closes the movie.
I don't know if everyone knows,
but Crispian is also a musician.
Yes, I've been known to twang.
- I thought there--
- This is actually our sound guy, Jerome.
- Did all of Gary's--
- Oh, really?
- Twat.
- Yeah.
I thought there was also a--
Johnny Fewings actually turned John Peel onto punk.
- Really'? Johnny Fewings.
- Yeah.
There he is. That was his claim
to fame. Apart from doing this movie.
There is an argument in cutting to black before-
As the van's screeching up. You just hear:
- Yeah, yeah.
- But I love the fact that he kind of--
He gives the wanker sign
and then they come back. Or they stop.
He's got the balls to tell them to sod off, but not--
That's as far as it goes. He's too smart.
Michael Price. Big shout out to Mike Price there.
This is also-- Lou Foley. Her first--
- Lovely Lou.
- Her first film.
Lou gave me a thing on the last day, Lou and Ben.
An invite to a party that they had years ago.
It was a picture from <i>Spaced</i>
they'd had their faces put onto.
And it was so sweet to know
that they'd done that a long time ago.
Yeah.
Well, I hope you've enjoyed
this DVD Blu-ray commentary.
Yeah, me too. I hope you've enjoyed it.
- And--
- I hope we haven't given too much away.
There's a lot more that we've held back a little bit.
There's more-- One thing about this movie...
...is it does bear up to repeated viewings.
And you'll see other stuff as you watch it again.
Oh, here we go, back into Uzilicious.
- Bring it on, yeah.
- I'll rap out the rest of the commentary.
Here we go:
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>Motherfucker.</i>
That's all I can say, really, is motherfucker. That helps.
- Yeah, what a good experience it was.
- Yeah. Absolutely.
So this is a kind of closure for us, really.
If there's a sequel, what would the sequel be?
"Keshava Mills."
Maybe it's the editor or someone at Shepperton...
...is spending too long in his booth
editing a horror movie.
I'd like to see Jack and Sangeet...
...just hanging out on a desert island together.
Wearing very little.
Tied to a palm tree.
I think, it's funny to think-- There's Claire Finbow, hey.
It's funny to think-- "Elizabeth Hurley?"
it's funny to think that a long, long-- I don't know how--
I wanna say four years ago...
...you came to me with a version of this script...
-...which was probably a short film.
- Yeah.
I read it and really liked it,
and then we started talking about it...
...and then it became--
Eventually became the film that you've just--
"John Pegg"? Is he related to me?
- Distant.
- You just watched.
And I love that evolution, you know?
This was a film that was made...
...without any supervision by the film business.
It was made by friends with a love for a script...
...just to wanna do something...
...that was completely out of the box and...
And I think it's very important that these
kind of films continue to get made...
...because, you know, the way that the film industry
is at the moment, it's very hard to get anything made.
And, you know, this kind of filmmaking
where you're just doing it by yourself...
...and getting shit out there is important, you know.
And also, you know, doing something
where you're not working in a genre...
-...and you're not working on a spin-off.
- Yeah.
Just trying to create something new.
And I think that this was for all those people...
...who enjoy and appreciate that sort of thing.
And "I'll See You In My Dreams." Let's play outwith that.
Oh, I love it. Look, there's the severed finger of--
I haven't actually seen these lovely little
graphics in the closing roll, actually.
"Cutler <i>&</i> Gross, Robert and Olivia Temple."
We're gonna play right out.
I think we should go right to the finals.
Here we go. There's Pinewood again.
And that's my baby, Fantastic Baby, Haridas...
...who was born three days before we started shooting.
- Oh, that's right.
- So he's exactly--
He's 1 next Wednesday.
- So he's exactly the same age as this film.
- God, is it really--?
- Yeah. This is nearly a year ago that we started shooting.
- And to black. Thank you.
