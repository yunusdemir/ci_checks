Hello?
"One resides in
a period of 48..."
Yeah.
Yeah, of course I remember you.
That's why I gave you my card.
Yeah, yeah. Ankle monitors don't
just fall off. You cut them off.
It's a big difference.
Because it's a violation.
- How you doing?
- I'm here.
Well, I can't advise
you to do that.
I hear banging.
- William Henry Jackson.
- Well, open it.
Right, open it
before they kick it in.
Hello?
No. No. Dear Jesus.
Hello?
Oh, God. Where'd they take him?
Roman! William's had a heart
attack outside his building.
He's at MLK.
- Is it serious?
- Of course it's serious.
He's at the emergency room.
Call the hospital,
and see what you can learn.
I'll tell you what to do.
I'll tell you exactly
what we're gonna do.
Get Kibby on the phone.
He can cover for him.
- Kibby retired.
- When?
Years ago. Now, listen, Roman,
William had a full day today.
- Okay.
- You have to cover for him.
- Okay.
- Tell the clients
and the prosecutors
and the judges what's going on.
- Okay.
- Get continuances.
- Okay.
- Just continuances.
Just continuances.
I typed up his day.
It's in there on my desk.
- All right.
- Dear Lord.
Okay.
Just continuances.
<i>All metal goes in the trays.</i>
- Phones, change.
- Step forward, please.
If you have a
belt, please remove it.
Keys.
Any loose change.
You must remove it
so it can be scanned.
Next person.
Put your arms out.
Just hold right there.
Listen, my iPod,
I got 8000 songs in here.
The last time
I put that in there
I lost the bass range on
Gil Scott-Heron's
"Winter in America."
Brian Jackson.
Everything gets scanned.
- Step up, please.
- Next.
Thank you, sir.
All phones off.
Phones off.
All phones off.
Excuse me, sister.
Where's the, uh...?
The court for white folks?
Phones off.
Wack-ass.
Quiet in the court.
Uh. Excuse me.
What do you have
on number 32?
Langston Bailey?
This says William Jackson's
his lawyer.
Well, Mr. Jackson had
a heart attack this morning.
I'm Roman Israel,
his partner.
I didn't know Jackson
had a partner.
Well, I don't have
the, uh, patience
for the butchery that
occurs here. Mr. Jackson does.
You want a continuance?
What bail you offering?
No bail.
And he pleas to count one.
I'll tell the judge and request
a minimum five years.
He's facing 15 at trial.
For a 17-year-old
breaking and entering?
Hell, why don't we just get
it over with and shoot him?
That's the offer.
Do what you gotta do.
Offer doesn't really,
I mean...
He's not taking top plea.
I can tell you that.
You're already
overcharging him.
L-Let's talk about
mitigating circumstances.
He was caught wearing a T-shirt
with a gang symbol.
Like the flag pin
on your lapel.
Five years. That's as low
as the People will go.
People? What people?
There's no people.
There's just you making a
bullshit career-climbing offer.
Come on, let's admit it.
Present it to your client.
His name is Langston.
He's a high school junior
in good standing.
Plays on the soccer team.
All of this despite
that his father's in jail.
His mother is in
drug treatment.
And due to a legion of forces
beyond his control,
he joined a gang for acceptance,
family, and protection.
He has one prior minor offense.
Each one of us is greater than
the worst thing we've ever done.
Deep bows.
Please, talk to your client.
My conviction rate's
100 percent.
All rise.
Court of District Nine
is now in session.
The Honorable James Hurakami
is presiding.
Langston Bailey.
<i>Thank you, bailiff.
You may be seated.</i>
Wow, five to seven?
Thought I was going
to juvie though.
I want to speak to
Mr. Jackson.
He's in the hospital.
When's he coming back?
Wish I knew.
I want a new lawyer. I want
to switch. I have rights.
Mr. Jackson is the one
who comes to court,
but he comes to me
for legal guidance.
Now, you're being overcharged
to accept a plea,
and to keep things moving.
They want to punish you for
even asking for a day in court.
It's a volume business.
With guards getting overtime,
and private companies
owning the jails
and building them as well.
It's a fact.
You want to fight, we'll fight.
I mean, to hell with the bill.
But if we take it to trial,
and you lose,
they hit you with 15 years.
And they rarely lose.
Keep your head up.
And do some push-ups.
This is a preliminary hearing
on the case
of <i>The People of
the State of California</i>
<i>v. William Carlos Ramirez.</i>
Case number A64-9725.
Counsel will
state your names.
People are represented
by Michael Wesley.
Roman J. Israel, Esquire,
on behalf of Mr. Ramirez.
Mr. Israel,
I'll grant a continuance,
given lead counsel's
medical emergency.
Um. I'd like to dive
right in, Your Honor.
Very good.
Proceed.
Uh, your Honor, the People
request the defendant,
Mr. William Carlos Ramirez
be held to answer
on three counts of violating
Health and Safety Code
Section 11351:
possession of
powder cocaine for sale.
Mr. Ramirez was observed and
filmed making three drug sales
to undercover officers.
Mr. Ramirez made a confession
to detectives
that he supported himself
selling drugs.
Objection. Motion to strike.
Mr. Ramirez was told
he was not under arrest,
and was interrogated
without the benefit
of his Miranda warning,
yet he was refused
use of the bathroom.
That's a violation
of civil rights.
Um, it wasn't an interrogation.
It was an interview.
Overruled.
If a cop hauls you in, and
says you can't use the bathroom
then you're being detained.
We're moving on.
What was he supposed to do,
your Honor, pee himself?
You can wait, and address
this at trial.
I would like
to address it now.
I'm just saying
we have a real...
Mr. Israel.
Did you hear what I said?
If...
armed guards in this courtroom
detained you
and would not allow you
to use the bathroom
you would, by all definition,
be detained.
What is good for the goose
is good for the gander.
I'm gonna hold you in contempt
if you continue to pursue this.
With all due respect,
you're asking me to obey
an erroneous court decision.
You tell me to wait.
In my experience, wait...
Okay.
Find you in contempt.
Is there anything else you'd
like to add before I set fine?
<i>I told you
to just get continuances.</i>
Yeah, I'm filing an appeal.
<i>Five thousand dollars?</i>
Well...
"I wouldn't trust a lawyer
that didn't get complaints
from the prosecution
or the court." Who said that?
- <i>I have no idea.</i>
- William.
<i>I can always
count on you to say</i>
<i>the utterly
inappropriate thing.</i>
<i>I'm with Lynn now.
She's very upset about it.</i>
How is he?
<i>It's not good.
They're still running tests.</i>
All right, well, I'll come over
to the hospital.
<i>Don't. He's not even in his room.
You understand?</i>
- Yeah.
- <i>What's that?</i>
<i>Well, Lynn says we'll talk
about it tomorrow, Roman.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>
<i>You have reached
the Los Angeles Police Department</i>
<i>Noise Enforcement Team.</i>
<i>Please leave your name,
contact telephone number,</i>
<i>and a Noise Enforcement Team
officer will contact you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.
Thank you, and have a nice day.</i>
Yes. My name is
Roman J. Israel, Esquire.
I'd like to report
a construction noise violation,
570 Gladys Avenue. That's
G-L-A-D-Y-S Avenue, Los Angeles.
City regulation 5612
prohibits construction
and-or repair of any kind
between the hours of
7 p.m. until 7 a.m.
the following morning.
Thank you.
<i>Please leave your
name, contact telephone number</i>
<i>and a Noise Enforcement
Team officer</i>
<i>will contact you
as soon as possible.</i>
<i>Thank you,
and have a nice day.</i>
<i>My name is Roman J.
Israel, Esquire.</i>
<i>I want to report construction
noise at 570 Gladys Avenue.</i>
<i>That's G-L-A-D-Y-S Avenue.</i>
<i>City regulation 5612 requires</i>
that there is no construction
or repair of any kind
between the hours of
7 p.m. and 7 a.m.
the following morning.
Five-six-one-two.
That's the city regulation.
That's the law.
I'm a lawyer.
Goodbye.
- Hello, Roman.
- Hi.
- This is George Pierce.
- Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
The doctors have
concluded that William
is in a permanent
vegetative state.
Ah. Well, he'll
surprise them.
Well, we'd like to believe
that but not this time.
You get a second opinion?
He's had three.
Now, Roman,
my uncle gave me
financial and medical
power of attorney.
If the firm was stable,
we'd have time to mourn
but it's not, and we don't.
William's directive asks
using George
in the event
of incapacitation.
And George has
generously offered
to take time
from his busy practice
to sort through
the remaining cases,
help close the office,
and collect what's due.
Well, I probably haven't had
time to consider all the, uh,
you know, various
ramifications of this.
None of us have.
I can't live on my accolades.
Well, Lynn was hoping
to give you and...
What's the receptionist's
name?
- Vernita.
- Vernita, severance.
But looking over the books,
it just doesn't seem possible.
I'll take over. Ahem.
No, you're not capable
of continuing the practice.
On your contempt fine,
we can argue
extreme emotional distress
and hope for a reduction.
Right. B-b-but I'll take over,
because in the architecture
of this firm, I am a pillar.
Yes, and, Roman, I'd hoped
to reward you for that.
Hope don't get
the job done.
What does that mean?
That means hope
don't get the job done.
Is it ego
or delusion?
Honestly, I...
I never paid enough
attention to you.
This place runs more like a
charity service than a law firm.
It's run a deficit for years.
We...
his family,
can no longer afford it.
We're clearing the books.
We're handing this
off to George.
Roman, I'm sorry.
God, help me.
Yeah, just tell
him to wait.
No, just tell him to wait.
I'll be there in 30. Less.
All right.
One sec, one sec.
- So you have...? Uh-huh.
- I'll talk to him.
I'm sorry, man.
I feel for you.
This where the bulldog
did his work?
What a mind.
He was great in the seat
and great on his feet.
Jesus, didn't he ever
throw anything away?
My secretary's gonna call.
She'll be point on this.
What do you use?
LegalPRO? Quicken?
What's that?
Status on every case,
depositions,
investigations, uh,
conferences.
What, on cards?
You're kidding.
I'm not helping you fast-plead
just so you can get a fee.
Well, I'm in court every day.
I fight hard for my clients.
You're a low-flying bee.
Is that what William
said about me?
William never mentioned you.
- What's that about, then?
- Fact.
Recorded fact, every case.
Organized and available.
And you can fact-check that
if you'd like on your
legal Quicken.
I don't have time for this.
My office will call
to coordinate going forward.
Let's watch him now.
Young George.
<i>State of California
v. Jason Angelo Fisher.</i>
One of his first cases.
Fisher's first offense.
Should have been reduced
to misdemeanor possession.
But you pled him out to felony,
conspiracy, and possession.
That became your M.O.
Take a retainer, waive your
client's rights to a prelim,
then dump them on the public
defenders when they complain.
What, you worked
the Fisher case? His appeal?
I recall reading the record.
- That was seven years ago.
- Eight.
So you're saying you know
all that from memory?
Seven years,
eight months, 47 days.
I'm quite confident
of my recollections.
Well, my win-loss record
is above 90 percent.
That's false and misleading.
That's only if you count
your three years
as a prosecutor.
Well, William
thought highly enough
to bring me in
if something happened.
Believe me,
I'm going to find out why.
Roman. Hey, Roman.
Where you going?
- Where you going?
- MLK.
Come on,
I'll give you a ride.
I'd rather walk.
Come on, Roman.
I just want to talk.
William taught a term at Loyola.
That's where we met.
I was, uh, top of my class.
Potential's a bitch.
Well, I'll tell you
what's not is having
four offices and 60 people
working for you.
He picked me
because I tossed him work.
You know, loser cases
I didn't want,
or I was too busy to handle.
This, closing his office,
it's payback.
I'll collect a fee.
Look, it just so happens I could
use someone with your ability
and your power
of persuasive argument.
And I'll pay you twice
what William gave you.
What do you say?
What makes you different
from this car?
Whoa.
Really? Okay.
I'm gonna tell you
something I think
maybe will surprise
and disappoint you.
I got a kickback from William
for every single case
I gave him.
Bullshit.
I have the records.
Apparently, you've been
untouched by the messy business
of running a small
criminal defense firm.
Was it wrong?
On some level, sure.
Does it diminish
what he did? Hell, no.
No, it allowed him
to keep the doors open.
It kept you two going.
And to this day, I still
remember quotes from his class.
And that voice.
"What is tolerance? It is the
consequence of humanity.
"We are all formed of
frailty and error.
"Let us pardon reciprocally
each other's follies.
That is the first law
of nature."
So what do you say we forget
the past and move forward?
Pull over.
I can't work for you.
What are you gonna do?
I'll continue in
criminal litigation.
That's a bitch of a market.
- What if you can't find something?
- What?
For argument's sake, if you
can't find a firm, what's next?
There is no next.
There is no argument's sake.
There's underwear model
or activist attorney.
There is no next.
- <i>Yeah, George.</i>
- I want to bring someone in.
<i>Are you asking me,
or are you telling me?</i>
Jackson had a guy who drafted
all his memoranda.
I think he's a bit of a savant.
<i>He paid him 500 a week.</i>
<i>We can bill him out
for that much an hour.</i>
Maya.
It's Roman Israel.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I usually work off
scheduled appointments.
It's okay. I had some pretzels
and soda from down there.
That's fine.
So Jeff tells me you work
with William Henry Jackson.
Yes, for 36 years.
We are... We were partners.
He was the public face
of the firm.
I was the man behind
the curtain, so to speak.
How is he?
Unconscious
several weeks now.
I'm so sorry.
Well, come on in.
Um...
I have no safeguard
against unemployment.
So William and Ronald
were old friends and associates
going back to Berkeley.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Ronnie mentions William
in his book.
Right. Yes, yes.
I'd like to speak with him.
Ron is at our headquarters
in Washington.
There something
I could help you with?
Uh, well, um...
First, notwithstanding
I don't know
if I could do this
much longer,
progressive lawyering.
You see, I'm not accustomed
without William.
The criminal side
of our practice funded
our policy
and legal challenges,
as in defendants' rights, uh,
prison conditions,
and drafted attacks on state
and federal criminal codes.
If I was freed
from criminal work,
I can get back to my roots.
The bigger battles,
organized mass action
supported by sweeping
legal challenges.
With my skill
and, uh, experience
I'm-I'm quite certain
I can get this organization
right back in line
with its core beliefs.
- This organization?
- Yes.
Yeah. I-I wasn't aware
that we, um, had strayed.
Well, I'm not talking about
nickel-and-dime reformism.
I'm talking about igniting
a sustained mass movement,
supported by rule change
and injunctive relief.
And I could get results
using class-action tactics.
I'm talking about a return
to using activist litigation
creatively, defensively,
counter-offensively.
I am very proud
of what we've done here.
I think we're making significant
headway in many, many areas.
Well, in my experience,
that's, uh,
an excuse to-to feel good
and to slack off.
Oh. Who's slacking off?
I attended Western State
College of Law
at Argosy in Fullerton. Started
the first student union there.
I chose cause over ambition.
I could've joined one
of the big firms
like the rest of them,
and been seduced.
But I was inspired
by Mr. Jackson.
I went to work for him.
You can...
There's a detailed record
of all of our victories.
Civil rights victories
on there.
As for my personal life,
at a certain point
I had to decide whether
to have a family or career.
I couldn't do both.
So I stayed on the front lines.
Now, I'm offering
at this time...
to work, exclusively...
as your, um...
long-haul,
three-dimensional,
revolutionary,
in-house,
full-time, paid advocate.
Mr. Israel,
we're all volunteers here.
Our few salaried staff
work out of D.C.
I'd go to interview, but I'm
precluded for pecuniary reasons.
Money of late's been
a motivating factor in my life.
Well,
be that as it may, uh,
positions are filled.
Look, I'm well worth
having in this thing.
I have no doubt of that.
Because there's something
to be fired up about.
We are, believe me.
Ah, well, I'll, um...
Go through William's Rolodex.
Thank you, uh,
for your time.
You know, if you're, uh,
interested in volunteering
we're having a meeting
next week.
We could use someone
with your legal expertise.
Perhaps you could give a talk.
I'd like that.
Here's my card.
I crossed out
the office address.
And I wrote my home address,
so you can reach me via mail.
I'll probably
just text you.
I can do that,
I think.
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Thank you.
Right on.
What a freak.
You stand
on his shoulders.
<i>Good afternoon. Yeah, my
name is Roman J. Israel, Esquire.</i>
<i>Yeah, Israel. Yes.</i>
<i>Yes, like the... Like...
Yes, right, exactly.</i>
I'm an attorney,
civil rights attorney.
I was inquiring about
a possible job...
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Right, if I... If...
<i>Right, ma'am, if I had a job,
I wouldn't be calling you.</i>
<i>That's why I'm calling.
I don't have... Hello?</i>
<i>...C-K-S-O-N. And I'd like
to speak to someone</i>
<i>about any
possible positions...</i>
<i>Yeah, I'll reach out again.</i>
<i>In case any jobs come up,
I'd appreciate a call back.</i>
<i>Yeah, good morning. My name is
Roman J. Israel, Esquire.</i>
<i>I can send you my résumé.</i>
<i>I was with
William Henry Jackson.</i>
<i>I'm hoping to find if there's
an employment opportunity...</i>
<i>No, not the number
that's crossed out.</i>
<i>It's the number below
the number that's crossed out.</i>
<i>Yes, ma'am. Thank you.</i>
<i>Um, Mr. Israel?</i>
<i>George Pierce would like you
in his office right away.</i>
The best thing to do is
engage fully with the process.
Otherwise, you feel
powerless, and you...
Come on in.
Roman, I'd like you
to meet Felicity Ellerbee.
- Felicity, this is Roman Israel.
- Hi.
He'll be working closely
with me on this. Sit down.
Roman's a terrific attorney.
We're very lucky to have him.
Felicity's nephew Derrell was
arrested two days ago
in connection with
an armed robbery
during which a clerk
was sadly killed.
Derrell's been charged with
assault, first-degree murder.
It was his friend that was there
with him. It wasn't Derrell.
Derrell didn't know
that he was going to do that.
Of course.
We completely understand.
Derrell was not the shooter.
It's our job to prove
how uncomplicit
he was in
the actual murder.
The way this will work is
Roman's gonna
be the point person.
And you were very, very wise
to retain private counsel.
I'm not gonna lie to you,
Derrell's got
a mountain to climb.
It's imperative he receives
the best defense.
I can promise you
that's what he'll get here.
I had to
mortgage my house.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't like lawyers.
Me either.
I understand.
If I don't get answers
to my questions,
if I don't see results,
if I see padded shit
popping up in my bill,
I will fire your ass.
I'm putting up my house.
I understand.
You always dress like that?
Ah, well, uh,
in lieu of wardrobe,
I have a reputation
as a dedicated advocate.
Let me give you my card.
If there's any questions
concerns, anything you want
to talk about, day and night,
free of charge, I'm here.
I'm available for you.
It's not
the crossed-out number.
It's the number above
the crossed-out number.
What's "Esquire" mean?
Uh, it's a designation, uh,
in the legal arena.
It's like
a title of dignity.
Slightly above gentleman,
below knight.
Yes.
Come in.
Roman, I'd like you
to meet James Lee.
Jim, this is Roman Israel.
He'll be working closely
with me on this.
- Hi.
- Please sit down, Roman.
Roman's a terrific attorney.
We're very lucky to have him.
Jim's wife, Mari,
was cited last night
for felony DUI hit and run,
with added charges for
reckless driving and injury.
The way this will work is
Roman's gonna
be the point person.
You were very wise
to retain private counsel.
Mari's... She's gonna
need, and deserves,
the best defense possible.
We're gonna make sure
she gets exactly that.
From George.
It's at that point,
per the night manager,
that Derrell's friend,
Carter Johnson
shoots the clerk
twice in the head.
- Okay.
- They empty the register,
roughly $500,
and then run into the alleyway
where Derrell is caught
and Johnson escapes.
Johnson is a shot caller
with the Rollin 100.
He's got four
outstanding warrants,
including two
for prior shootings.
Now, your boy
Derrell is...
Don't use "boy."
Your client is seen entering
the store on the outside camera
but the inside video
wasn't working.
The Armenian
Community Council
put up $100,000
for Johnson's arrest
for the clerk,
who was Armenian.
Your client Derrell has two
priors going back four years.
Uh, one for
drug possession, marijuana,
and the other for theft.
I have a
domestic violence case.
This guy assaulted
the same woman six times,
and she's swearing out an
affidavit for non-prosecution.
- Have you heard of Tempura House?
- No. What's that?
It's a shelter for
lightly battered women.
That's funny.
That's funny.
Turn on the light,
they run like roaches.
You work here?
Yes, sir, I do.
Jessie Salinas.
Supervising attorney.
Roman J. Israel.
I'm the new guy.
Did you just compare
us to roaches?
There's no tiptoeing
into this.
We're just blowing off steam...
You're tourists.
I'll see you around,
Israel.
Roman.
Roman.
Jesus.
I heard about you today
in the kitchen.
Salinas is our number two.
Not only that,
you were schooling
Sanchez
in a crowded elevator?
That man doesn't understand
character evidence.
Then find a quiet corner.
I sent you an e-mail today
to come to my office.
I'm sorry, but when
people send e-mails,
they think it goes
straight to your brain.
You better take
what I'm saying seriously,
because I'm being
very sincere with you.
You knew what you were getting
when you brought me in.
Well, I thought you
were functional.
I think you brought me in
to put your feet to the fire,
'cause you're tired
of treating
low-income clients
like dollar signs,
and maybe you remember
what it feels like to care.
That's what I think,
George.
No, I hired you
to make a buck.
Which is why I thought
you took the job.
I need money. Heh.
Badly, of course.
But what I really need,
George, is an ally.
I've been waiting to meet
someone of your high caliber.
And, yes, I am selective.
So what I'm offering
to you right out here now
is a chance to partner with me
on a piece of groundbreaking
litigation
I've been working on
for over seven years now.
Inside this case is arguably
the most important legal brief
in modern legal history.
A sweeping federal challenge
that could yield nothing less
than a grand new era
of social reform.
And I say that
with all due competence.
The Constitution guarantees us
a right to a fair trial,
but there can't be any fairness
if 95 percent of all cases
never get heard.
Criminal cases never get heard
by a jury or a judge.
I am building a wholly
original class-action lawsuit
with over 3500 names,
all former clients
aimed at the heart
of plea-bargain reform.
I'm talking about reforming
a system where prosecutors
are trying to pull sentences
out of their hat.
Where guilt or innocence
is being completely replaced
by fear of having
your day in court.
Where people are being forced,
George, to plead guilty
under the threat of overly
harsh and coercive sentences.
It's a job for a legend,
or someone who wants to be one.
Let me tell you about it.
No, no, no.
Jesus, just stop.
Roman, enough.
Not speaking out
is ordinary.
We're agents of change,
George, each one of us.
Now, I don't have the resources
to finish this on my own.
But with your assistance,
I'm more than certain
that we can finish this
and file it together.
Partners on a landmark
class-action suit
built on precedents
and procedure
and actual proof,
weight of proof.
I'm sure of it, George.
Look, do you want this
job or not? Yes or no.
- Yes.
- Then you stop harassing people.
You stick to clients, you stick
to memoranda only. That's it.
Nothing else,
under no conditions.
Now, you have
any more pressing opinions,
you share them with me.
Don't come in tomorrow
without a suit.
Okay.
Driver's license,
California Bar card, visitor ID.
Yes.
I'm here to see
Derrell Ellerbee.
How they treating you?
You need anything?
I need to get out of here.
You understand the charges?
Yup. They want to bury me.
All right. From now on,
everything we discuss
will be confidential.
I gotta be careful.
Is somebody threatening you?
Look, I didn't shoot that guy.
Okay? I just went in.
I didn't know what
he was gonna do.
You gave a statement
to the police.
Yeah, I asked for a lawyer.
And before that,
after they read you
your rights,
you continued to talk
to the detective.
They said you said
that you saw
Carter Johnson with a gun.
I didn't know
he was gonna use it.
Knowing he had a gun
when you entered the store
that's aiding and abetting.
Criteria for
first-degree murder.
CJ. CJ shot the clerk.
All right? I saw it.
I'll testify
if they let me out.
They're not gonna
release you.
Case is too strong,
charges too severe.
Now we can talk to the DA.
See what they'll offer
for your testimony.
Probation?
Best you can hope for is
a possible reduction
to second-degree murder.
Right over here.
Have a seat
if you're so scared, man.
Look, I know where
CJ's holed up.
Plus testifying.
What's that worth?
Worth a lot.
The two combined can
carry significant weight.
But you understand the risks?
What you're looking at?
Yeah.
I gotta be transferred
to protective custody first.
This what you want to do?
I don't want to,
but I will.
Hello?
No one's supposed
to be in here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm...
I'm an attorney here,
and I was looking
for Mr. Pierce. I wanted
to talk to him about this case.
He's in depositions all day.
Mr. Salinas is supervising
attorney in his absence.
You'll have to leave.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why they sent
me this. I need more than this.
That's all we got.
I don't want the summary.
- I want the full deposition here.
- Okay.
And what about tomorrow?
What's my agenda?
- You're downtown all day.
- What is first?
Mr. Rutner at 9 a.m.
No, I don't
want to meet with him.
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Ah, hello.
My name is
Roman J. Israel, Esquire
from the law offices
of George Pierce.
I represent Derrell Ellerbee.
I'd like to speak to
ADA Kate Becker.
<i>Speaking.</i>
Oh. Oh, okay. Sorry.
- Uh, h-hi.
- <i>Hi.</i>
My client,
Mr. Derrell Ellerbee
is interested
in discussing a deal.
I have 40 open cases,
so refresh me.
<i>Right, uh, uh...</i>
Convenience store shooting.
An Armenian man was killed,
and there's a reward offered?
Uh-huh. Okay, I have it.
<i>The shooter,</i>
in this case, is a fugitive
Carter Johnson.
My client may know
his whereabouts
and might be willing
to testify.
He'll deliver on that?
Well, that depends.
If you waive all
objections and appeal,
and he's willing
to cooperate,
then we'll drop the assault
and kidnapping.
<i>And we'll reduce murder one</i>
<i>to manslaughter,
voluntary, 10 years.</i>
Involuntary, three to five.
No, a 21-year-old clerk
was killed
in a commission of a robbery.
It won't happen.
Well my client is giving
you the whole case
at a great risk to himself.
<i>Let's discuss
mitigating circumstances.</i>
Let's not. Voluntary
manslaughter, 10 years.
It's a good deal.
It's an enema of sunshine.
I don't have time for this.
Well, I'm sorry for
taking a nanosecond
off of your assembly-line,
rubber-stamp existence.
The People withdraw
their offer.
I don't care what the...
Hello?
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hey.
You didn't want to park closer?
There are spaces.
No, I don't have a car.
Wow, that's gotta
be tough in L.A.
I've always imagined
life with one.
Thanks for doing this.
Oh, you're welcome.
Public speaking
is something
I'm usually
encouraged to avoid.
So in anticipation
of Tuesday's protest,
I've invited attorney
Roman Israel
to talk about our rights,
and what to expect
if you are arrested.
Roman.
Thank you.
All right.
Back to my beginnings.
It feels good.
Hell, that was 40 years ago.
So here we go. We're gonna...
We're gonna rap...
I don't mean hip-hop.
...a little while about
some good old-fashioned
grassroots,
in-your-face protesting.
The time has come
to put social revolution
squarely back on the agenda
where it belongs.
Look at you.
Just like I was.
Just starting out
your fight against
the dominant tendencies
of our society.
Well,
you better get ready
for the commitment it takes
to lead a resistant lifestyle.
You better start forging
the armor to withstand
the temptation
and the financial
and emotional toll.
Because when it comes
to social injustice
and judicial indifference
and institutional racism
and outright goddamn greed
the overwhelming majority
of the people
in this country
just don't give a damn.
- That's right.
- That's right.
Civil or uncivil disobedience.
The First Amendment to protect
your right to freedom of speech
as long as you don't incite
violence or law-breaking.
And there are gonna be people
that get caught up in the march.
They're gonna vandalize.
They're... I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I see two sisters standing.
Why are the sisters standing
and the brothers sitting?
If we wanna sit,
we can ask.
Well, you ladies gotta
speak up for yourselves.
This ain't 40 years ago.
There's no statute
of limitations on chivalry.
- That's gendered and sexist.
- And polite.
- And patronizing.
- And polite.
What kind of law
do you practice?
I'm a criminal
defense attorney.
You ever represent
domestic violence defendants?
Many times.
Knowing that they're guilty?
Meaning what?
Meaning you have a choice.
Watch it. Someday you may need
the Sixth Amendment.
Oh, that's lawyer talk.
Oh, I see.
So we got a Sarah Lawrence
soul sister in the band.
Ha, ha, I'm not
your sister, asshole.
Oh, whoa, whoa...
I'm not an asshole, sister.
Hey, fuck you, brother.
Settle down, okay?
Thank you, Roman.
- Okay.
- Did you bring something to help?
Roman.
Roman.
I feel like I need
to apologize for that.
No you don't. It's my fault.
I say things.
- Are you okay?
- No, I... Yeah, it's okay.
It just got out of hand.
My meanings seem to obfuscate
more than clarify.
I mean, that's what
the discourse is.
- It's changed over the years.
- Right.
- It's what we talked about.
- You did.
That's a lot of what
this is about.
I just can't
seem to remove myself
from what's happened
in my life. I...
This is where we are,
the way the world is.
And I didn't even
want to come out.
The nuns said
I was a forceps baby.
- Me too.
- Yeah?
- No.
- No?
No.
Is he okay?
I don't feel anything.
Check his neck.
No.
What happened?
We just found him.
I think he's dead.
All right,
don't touch anything.
Man down, black
male, 60 years of age.
Not responding. Request RA.
What did I just say?
He doesn't have ID.
What did you
put in there?
- My card.
- Take it out.
Well, without ID
he'll get cremated and mixed up
with 1000 other homeless people.
Take it out.
It's just my name and number
for the coroner to call me.
- Did you hear my partner?
- Okay.
- Do what they say.
- I want to pay for the burial.
I'm not telling you again.
I won't let him
get swallowed up.
I won't let him disappear,
completely forgotten.
He most certainly
was somebody.
<i>All Wilshire units.
Possible 187. Suspect there now.</i>
<i>Western and Third
at Chinatown Express.</i>
<i>Suspects are
two male Hispanics.</i>
<i>Number one, large build...</i>
I'm sorry.
What do you mean?
That was unbelievable.
I thought he had no pulse.
No one does that.
Yeah, for good reason.
Hey. Yeah, I-I stepped out.
I'll be right back.
- I have to get back.
- Yeah. Okay.
I'm gonna call you.
Yeah, thank you. Me too.
We have a problem.
Come in.
Close the door.
Where did you get the idea you
could try and negotiate a plea?
Who told you
you could do that?
To just ignore
what I emphatically told you?
Derrell Ellerbee was
stabbed and killed
this morning in general lockup.
His aunt told me
that Derrell requested
protective custody last night,
but was delayed
because the prosecutor said
you pissed on her deal,
Roman.
That offer should, by law,
have been presented
to the client, it was not.
As of now, you've exposed us
to a malpractice suit,
Roman, I would kill
to be on the other side of.
You've had difficulty
comprehending my meaning,
so I'll be very, very clear.
As much as I wanna fire you,
I can't,
as that could be construed as
acknowledgment of wrongdoing.
So I'm gonna retain you, Roman.
I'm gonna retain you,
and then I'm gonna fire you.
If you attempt to quit
or you stop coming in
I swear to God, I'll hit you
with a motion to recoup damages
and I'll have you disbarred.
We're done here.
Yo, hey, man. Hey.
Yo, man, I'm sorry
to bother you, man, but...
Maybe you can help me out
with money or some...
I mean, anything.
Look, you see where I'm at, man.
All right. Slow down,
slow down, slow down.
Okay, man. I'm sorry.
Look, I appreciate it, man.
Look, I know it's late.
I appreciate you helping me.
Cool, man.
Here's some tickets
for the mission.
Give me the iPod, man!
- Give it to me. Come on.
- Get off me.
- The iPod!
- I don't have any money!
- Come on!
- You got the wrong guy!
You got the wrong guy!
You got the wrong guy.
What?
What?
Well, well.
Come over and sit.
He'll be glad you're here.
He's awake?
No, but I believe
somewhere he knows.
He was so very fond of you.
He looks a lot worse.
It won't be long now.
Last ripple of a mighty wave
washed ashore here.
And left us high and dry.
No, he didn't leave us.
He'll never leave us.
I thought it was built
on good ground, but...
there's nothing under it.
Roman, what's wrong?
You're too near me
to hear me.
Can't you see?
It's clear as crystal.
- What?
- We filed the wrong brief
in the wrong court
to the wrong judge.
What are you talking about?
A world where everyone's
feelings are reciprocated.
The capacity for everyone
to contribute. Come on.
Freedom is something
you can only give yourself.
That's nothing he agreed with.
I don't have any time anymore.
I don't have time to waste.
Trying to...
tell people not
to sleep so tight.
Telling people to turn around.
Toward what?
Roman, sit down.
There's no need anymore.
The incapacity ceases with
the cause that produces it.
Roman, he can hear you.
Well, that's what
I came to say.
Anyway, he...
Anyway, he's gone, so...
What he fought for,
what he takes with him,
that lasts forever.
Eroding as it was conceived.
What is wrong with you?
You know,
there's a shop by the ocean
that makes maple-glazed
turkey bacon doughnuts.
People sit under palm trees
and eat them
while the breezes are blowing
and the dolphins are playing.
I'm gonna go there.
Roman, all right, sit down.
- No. I'm gonna get one.
- No, no, sit down.
Roman.
Roman...
<i>Hello?</i>
Hello. I'm calling
in-in-in reference
to the deceased store clerk.
<i>I'm sorry?</i>
The... Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm calling in reference
to the... The shooter
of the deceased store clerk.
<i>Hold on a sec.</i>
Yes, can I help you?
Yes, the-the-the...
The man who did it,
I know where he is.
<i>I'm ready.</i>
Um, well, I'm calling about
the reward, the $100,000?
You know the name
of the suspect?
<i>We've had a lot of false leads.</i>
Carter T. Johnson.
<i>Where is he?</i>
Well, the-the man who did it,
I have an address.
<i>The clerk was my nephew.</i>
Listen, I'm-I'm
not comfortable, uh, uh
identifying myself.
I have a mechanism to collect
which protects, um, who I am.
<i>You could just say
where he is.</i>
<i>Civic duty.</i>
<i>Basic human dignity.</i>
Look, this is an achievement
for me, okay?
Not an inherent state
of my existence.
I want the money in cash as
soon as he's arrested, $100,000.
<i>Can't do cash.</i>
<i>Too risky.</i>
I'm the one taking the risk.
It's gotta be cash.
That's the way it is.
Okay. Fine.
<i>I don't care who you are.</i>
<i>I just want
the bastards caught.</i>
Okay. Okay.
- <i>The reward stands.</i>
- Okay.
<i>Information leading
to an arrest.</i>
- Okay.
- <i>You want cash, I'll do cash.</i>
<i>Give me the information.</i>
- You have a good day.
- Have a good one.
- Good morning.
- Morning. Yes, it is.
Good morning. I'll get three
of your turkey bacon
maple-glazed doughnuts, please.
Three turkey bacon maple.
Something to drink with that?
Yes, the hibiscus
pomegranate cooler.
Hibiscus pomegranate cooler.
Twelve dollars on the nose.
Can you break 100?
Of course.
Eighty-eight back to you.
- Keep the change.
- Hey, thanks.
- Those fit?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You think so?
- Trust me.
Can I get you
anything else today, sir?
A suit.
Suits.
Now we're talking.
Loews Santa
Monica Beach Hotel.
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
Welcome, sir. Checking in?
Roman J. Israel, Esquire.
- Welcome to Loews.
- Thank you.
Fuck.
- <i>It's a very nice suit.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>
Lynn went to your apartment
this weekend to speak with you,
but you weren't there.
Oh, I must have been out.
You... You don't know
what I'm talking about.
- You're firing me?
- No.
No. People became concerned
after you went to the hospital
Friday morning, and it was
decided, after some discussion,
that it was best not to leave
a message on your phone.
William died.
When?
Friday night, actually.
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't kill him.
There's gonna be a small
private funeral on Wednesday,
and then a full memorial
in several weeks.
Is that it?
I don't know
what you're feeling...
given how close you were.
I mean, I guess...
I guess I can kind of imagine.
Yeah. I put that behind me.
Well, I'm sorry for my outburst
the other day. I was...
I was overly harsh.
Lynn's been telling me
how vital you were
to William's work.
Always in the shadows,
never flagging,
and I pulled you
out of the back room
and forced you out
onto the floor. It was...
It was a lot to ask.
I've gotten Felicity Ellerbee
to sign a document
absolving us of any wrongdoing
in her nephew's death.
It's a good thing that she...
She believes that you were
just acting
in Derrell's best interests.
So that's in the rearview.
I've also learned today that we
picked up three new clients,
all of whom came
as referrals from your cases.
It seems like
your personal attention,
giving out your cell phone,
is quite the calling card.
I wanna institute the practice
for all our attorneys.
Good.
Look, you can
still leave, of course.
I fully understand.
I think maybe there's a...
Maybe there's a place
for you here if you...
- I wanna stay.
- You would?
Yes. I mean...
I'm tired of doing
the impossible
for the ungrateful.
I now have, uh, more...
practical concerns.
The, uh...
The suit's a big change.
Thank you.
I prefer double-breasted,
but, uh...
Ha. You broke open
the piggy bank, huh?
Yeah. Yes, I did.
My lack of success
is self-imposed.
So, Israel, there's a rumor
that you know the CPC by heart.
Yeah. Guilty as charged.
- Pleadings.
- Nine forty-eight, 973.
- Demurrer for irregularity.
- 1248.
Money laundering.
186.9, 186.10.
However, all pleadings
in those cases
are subject to the laws
of joinder and severance.
That's, uh, 954.
- Wow, impressive.
- Nice.
You gotta be kidding me.
I gotta go.
See you, Jessie.
Listen, um, I got a Prop 36
I could really use help with.
Okay.
We handled a lot of DTC motions
at my old firm.
Awesome. Um, I have some free
time this afternoon, if you do.
I don't know
what your caseload is like,
but I'll stop by?
- Yeah.
- Great.
So where do you
currently live?
Further away.
Well, if you lived here,
you'd be home by now.
Well, what do you think?
I think that
whatever we're chasing...
you got it all here.
- I'm sorry?
- When can I move in?
- Immediately.
- I'll take it.
Hello?
<i>Oh, hey.
It's, uh... It's Maya.</i>
Hi.
How are you doing?
Wonderful.
Good. I, uh...
I meant what I said last week
about staying in touch.
How's the new job?
Uh, I'm writing lengthy
interrogatories...
and amending complaints.
<i>It's no social-redeeming
quality or context.</i>
You know, it's...
It's awesome.
Okay.
Well, I was calling to see
if you wanted to go for dinner.
With me?
<i>With you?</i>
I'm confused.
I... I'd like that.
I'd like that.
- <i>I'd like that, yeah. Um...</i>
- Great.
Tonight? I mean...
<i>Tomorrow?</i>
- Works for me.
- <i>It works for me.</i>
Tonight works for me,
but I mean...
All right. I'll... I...
Tomorrow. I'll do tomorrow.
<i>We'll do tomorrow.</i>
Okay. I'll see you then.
<i>Bye.</i>
Everybody in?
All right,
let's get started.
Under the new fee structure,
our advance on felony cases
rises from 2000 to 2500.
Our felony daily rate rises
to 1500 from 1000.
Now, of course, some people are
gonna gag at the new numbers,
but what we're selling is
our impressive win-loss record,
our depth of talent,
all you fine people,
and, ultimately,
our lower all-in costs.
Take time to explain it
to people.
If you see a potential client
heading for the door,
you emphasize
our new personalized approach.
All right,
I've also decided to devote
a share of our time
to pro bono.
Now, that's not an area
we have much experience with,
but someone here does.
It's the first
he's heard about it,
but Roman will be heading up
our new pro bono program.
Roman, you wanna say
a few words?
Will this
cut into my salary?
I mean in terms
of billable hours?
Okay.
All right.
Connor, you'll be
assisting Roman.
I want to get moving
on it right away.
Folks, take a look.
It's already
in the new brochure.
All right, questions?
Nothing? Good.
Roman, I didn't
dress for this place.
Oh, there's no code.
It's a bit
uncomfortable for me.
You don't like it?
This will cost a fortune.
Well...
Yeah. We deserve it.
You know,
I really heard what you said,
the first time you came in.
About progressive lawyering
being the cornerstone
of modern activism.
Particularly given the tunnel
that we're descending into.
You, the few lawyers
like you...
Thank you.
You really took up
the mantle of leadership
with your own advocacy.
You're out there...
and alone for so many years.
I feel like...
I don't know. I feel
like I was meant to meet you.
Ah.
- Thank you.
- I've been going through
my own struggles.
You know, trying to balance
what I do...
and the sacrifices.
I've asked myself many times,
"Why do I see things
so differently
from other people?"
You know, why...?
Why do I care so much
that our humanity
is connected to each other?
I have moments...
I have extended periods
of real doubt.
I'm just holding on
by a thread.
So, uh...
hearing you...
and, um, understanding
what you've been through...
...and, uh... Thank you.
Just knowing you.
I mean, honestly,
Roman, you're inspiring.
I've never had
it before, but...
I imagined Duck à l'Orange
to be different somehow.
Jesus, I'm being serious.
Perhaps you need to look
at things differently.
You all right?
- How?
- Well...
the world is for wonderful
things, isn't it?
Define "wonderful."
Okay. As an example...
who says...
you can't steal a car
in self-defense?
In reference to what?
If one required
a means of escape, so to speak.
Escape from what?
Possibility to actuality.
I mean, it follows.
The logic is valid,
thus the premise is true.
Every weapon is a tool
if you hold it the right way.
You're
saying to justify something?
I'm saying...
purity...
...can't survive
in this world.
Living conditions
have bearing.
I'm talking about
the burden of activism.
Exactly.
What are you talking about?
My ears are ringing.
It's somebody's phone.
Roman.
It's very difficult
to be truthful.
Not just with principles...
but with yourself.
To admit that you
want something else
and to try and act on it.
But I don't want
something else.
I feel blessed
to believe in something.
The way you do.
Thanks for dinner.
That was very generous.
The portions were small.
I'm moving into a new place
in a few days, after 35 years.
You're going through
a lot of changes.
Yeah. Yeah.
Kind of worried
I'm gonna miss my old place.
Maybe you should wait
until you're sure.
Nah, signed the contract.
I can't go back.
- I called a car.
- Already got you one.
See, I can Uber and text.
It's right here.
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
Goodnight.
I just want you to know
how much you've helped me...
- by, uh, meeting you.
- Mm.
For what you do.
- Your hair looks great.
- Thank you.
William lived
on grand notions,
influenced by
impractical ideas...
in a house trembling
with promise
and shouts of triumphs
yet to come.
Imploring and inspiring.
A believer that the moral arc
of the universe is long,
but bends towards justice.
He ignited a spark
in each and every one of us...
and that light
can never die.
We have over 1000
attending the memorial.
Yeah, and not
one of them
returned his calls
when he was alive.
I think it would be great
if you spoke.
And tell them what?
- You two talk the same language.
- Yeah, no, thank you.
- If it's nerves...
- It's not.
- There's no one more deserving.
- They wouldn't wanna hear it.
Hear what?
The real enemies aren't on
the outside. They're within.
We'll talk soon.
I'll call you.
You take care of yourself.
I am.
I disbelieve that.
I'll be in touch.
Roman, I'll see you
at the office.
I have something
for you.
No, you're right.
That 2500
is higher than average.
But let me direct you
to our firm's win-loss record,
our lower all-in costs,
personalized service.
- It's all there in the brochure.
- I don't know.
You're wise to price shop.
Very, very wise.
When it comes to defending
your loved ones,
there's a lot of people
in prison
that would attest that
that's a bad idea.
We're going to do it.
Okay.
<i>Tickets for this week's game</i>
<i>available now
on the main concourse,</i>
<i>right behind Aisle 14.</i>
Man, you've had
some crash course, huh?
From William Henry Jackson
to George Pierce?
What a ride.
You seem to be
settling in okay though.
From all appearances.
I got a lot of plans, Roman.
I mean, nothing we have to get
too deep into here,
understand, but...
down the line, there is a lot
I'd like to discuss.
I'm gonna want
your thoughts.
You know,
closer community contact...
taking on more family
and housing cases,
setting up alternative
work arrangements.
All while actually increasing
productivity and retention,
which is not to suggest
it's about drumming up business.
I mean, something's gotta get
you up in the morning, right?
Yes, three point.
And going back
to William Henry...
I told you I still remember
quotes from his class.
"I believe
because of my beliefs."
Cards-on-the-table time:
I was gonna leave law,
before I took his class.
After him, I doubled down.
You know, all his talk
of what could be
and the difference one man could
make. You gotta make a living.
Four offices, this market?
It's... It's no small thing.
Of course he didn't
see it that way.
He told me I was, uh...
I was drowning
in the shallow end.
Worse was, I knew it.
And then you
come along, you...
You shake things up a bit,
and here we are sitting,
talking new possibilities,
where we can go.
Hell, I don't
have to explain. You get it.
Christ, you're gonna be
right in the middle of it.
- Come on, man.
- That's bullshit.
Oof! L.A. traffic, man,
there's no getting around it.
Glad I caught you before we
came in. We just landed this.
It's a capital case.
You have experience with those?
We handled quite a few.
I'll make the introduction,
then I'll bow out
and you'll stay.
Okay.
I looked at that
prison overcrowding case
you and William worked on.
Which one?
Against Men's Central.
- You prevailed.
- Oh, that was overturned.
Yeah?
How's your big
plea-reform brief going?
Ah...
Put it aside.
Well, tell me more about it.
I'm interested.
Carried it as far
as I can take it.
Well, how about some help?
I mean, I've been
thinking about it.
I've become less skeptical
about the possibilities
and scope of what you said.
I could devote office resources,
help you complete the brief.
We could file at federal
court together.
That's the first step.
It'll take years
of commitment
to see it through.
Commitment doesn't seem
to be a problem for you.
I hear you're moving
to a new apartment.
- How'd you hear that?
- Payroll comes across my desk.
- I know that building, not cheap.
- I had money saved.
I mean, it's great.
It's a nice building.
No, I mean, I had money
saved for a long time.
- Well what else is it good for?
- Ha, ha.
- You got your ID?
- Yeah, yeah.
George Pierce
and Roman Israel
to see our client,
Carter Johnson.
- Carter Johnson?
- I meant to tell you.
They picked him up on Friday
from the Ellerbee case.
We've been retained.
Hello, Carter.
I'm George Pierce, and this is
my associate Roman Israel.
Roman is a devoted advocate
and a fabulous attorney.
And he's gonna be
the point person on your team.
- You're good, huh?
- Well, he's better than good.
Have you had a chance
to review the fee structure?
- The stuff you sent over? Yeah.
- Yeah.
You understand this is
a capital murder case?
- Yeah.
- All right, first off,
you wanna be fully up to speed
on your file.
You will make better decisions
if you're completely informed
about every aspect of your case
and you know all your options.
I know all my options.
Well, unfortunately, we, uh,
can't change what's been done.
That means
facing this head-on.
I think
you understand the penalties
you're facing
are very severe.
In overview,
we're gonna study the discovery
of the evidence
the prosecution gives us.
And we're gonna
force the prosecution
to give us anything
and everything we want.
- Roman, you wanna step in?
- Yeah, we're gonna...
We're gonna perform a private
investigation, and, uh...
devise a defense.
That's not all we'll do.
We'll outwork the prosecution.
All right?
We're gonna outwork them,
we're gonna outperform them.
And we're gonna get you
the best result possible.
Life in a cage.
Well, that's the outcome
we're fighting.
It'll be a long process,
and it's gonna cost quite a bit.
So with that in mind, I...
I'd like to suggest
there's no need
for two billable attorneys
at this early phase.
If it's okay with you, I'll bow
out. I'll let Roman continue.
It's okay with me.
All right, Carter.
I'll be in touch.
Roman, I'll speak
with you later.
Okay.
Guard.
The, um...
Uh...
The prosecutors are gonna favor
a grand jury
over a preliminary hearing,
which will allow them to wait
and reveal the evidence
at the trial.
You represented Derrell.
Uh, briefly.
I asked for you
after talking to his cellie.
We have a number of legal
maneuvers we can employ,
to try and force a prelim.
- I don't care about the prelim.
- I'd advise that we pursue it.
You knew where I was.
When was that?
Before they picked me up.
I'm sure Derrell
shared that info
with a number of people.
No.
You're the only person
he told.
That's what he told the guy.
You called it in,
collected the reward money.
- You fucked me.
- I presented myself...
on your request
for an attorney.
You're talking,
but it don't mean nothing.
I ain't never
getting out of here.
They got me cold.
I'll tell you this.
I got you.
Anytime I want.
- Guard... Guard.
- Any place.
- Guard!
- Could've already done it.
- Guard.
- But I want you to be where I am.
- Guard!
- Thinking about it.
Guard.
Go on and tell somebody
what you did.
- I want out.
- Broke your own law.
- Privileged information.
- Guard!
Tell them
about the law you broke.
They'll throw you
in here with me.
But you're gonna run.
Try it.
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah.
- Mr. Burton, how are you?
- How you doin'?
Come this way.
Hello?
Hello?
<i>Front desk.</i>
Yes, I just received a call.
There was no one there.
<i>Well, they
asked for you, Mr. Israel.</i>
Did they give a name?
<i>I'm sorry. No, they didn't.</i>
Hello?
Hey!
Hey, you okay?
You all right, mister?
I was running.
You need any help?
It was a bad decision.
- It wasn't my first.
- Dude's crazy.
Come on.
Hello?
<i>Hey. It's Maya.</i>
- Hi, Maya.
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
Uh...
Nothing much.
<i>You'd tell me
if I was bugging you.</i>
No.
<i>Well, that's honest.</i>
<i>You know I only call you
when I'm down.</i>
<i>That's horrible, right?</i>
<i>One of my friends...</i>
<i>One of my best staffers
quit on me yesterday.</i>
<i>Told me that working here
was just for his résumé.</i>
Yeah...
The ability to have, uh...
conflicting ideas
in one's head takes effort.
<i>I like that.</i>
<i>How's your day going?</i>
Uh, you know...
life smiles, I smile back.
<i>You don't
sound like you're smiling.</i>
I'm a little...
Kind of anxious, actually.
<i>Well, just tell yourself</i>
<i>that most of the things
you worry about</i>
<i>will never, ever happen.</i>
I'll try that.
<i>Alcohol works even better.</i>
- <i>Roman?</i>
- Yeah.
<i>It's a really bad connection.
Where are you?</i>
In a desert.
<i>Yeah, it feels
like that sometimes.</i>
<i>Just gotta keep moving.</i>
Well which way?
<i>Head on.
Just straight through.</i>
- Hello?
- <i>Roman?</i>
- <i>Hey, can you hear...?</i>
- Hello?
Maya?
<i>Soulful action
affects the course of law.</i>
<i>It's called to account
the original complaint.</i>
<i>The agents have changed,
united by virtue.</i>
<i>Wrongs will be righted.</i>
<i>The loophole
of ambiguity in the system...</i>
<i>Legal challenge
based on improvement...</i>
<i>Revised draft of a new

<i>Reverted to history,

<i>Levels of the law. There needs

<i>Who'll see us?</i>
<i>What the world could be,
not what it is.</i>
<i>Society is something

<i>Must stand,

Hey, Roman.
What are you doing?
<i>Case 00-001.</i>
<i>Supreme Court
of Absolute Universal Law.</i>
<i>Los Angeles division.</i>
<i>Roman J. Israel, Esquire,
petitioner</i>
<i>versus himself, defendant.</i>
<i>Notice.</i>
<i>To permanently disbar
Roman J. Israel, Esquire</i>
<i>from the California Bar
and human race</i>
<i>for being a hypocrite</i>
<i>and turning his back
on everything</i>
<i>he ever claimed
to actually stand for...</i>
Hey.
I just heard something
disturbing about you
from a solid source.
About the Ellerbee case.
Carter Johnson?
You collected the reward?
Is that true?
<i>...in the
city of Los Angeles.</i>
- <i>During that time...</i>
- Roman.
<i>...for the above-mentioned
request</i>
<i>for immediate
and summary judgment.</i>
I thought we
were working tonight.
Uh, I plan to leave.
Monday, then? Tomorrow?
I believe I'll be unavailable
for the foreseeable future.
You know the facts.
- Just jump in.
- You mean, on my own?
You got it.
Did you check his office?
<i>That's what
I'm saying, he left already.</i>
- When?
- <i>A few minutes ago.</i>
Goddamn it,
he's not answering his cell.
Just keep trying him
and let me know, all right?
Roman. Roman!
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'm back.
- What is that?
- That's for you.
- It's a bulldog.
- Amongst other things.
- It's so real.
- It actually is alive.
Why are you giving it to me?
To take care of.
You're a trip.
Well, you're worth
having this thing.
Here. Put it up here.
- Is it yours?
- For a while.
Well, then you
should keep it, Roman.
Well, I don't have room.
- In your apartment.
- I gave it up.
Why?
I'm going away.
Where?
Wherever they send me.
See, something has occurred.
Something...
I've just taken a career
which was certainly
sincere and...
And well-intentioned
and launched it right into
the realm of the truly
transformational.
I promise you that the attorney
that triumphs in this instance
won't be the one with the most
formal education or legal skill.
Roman, what are you
talking about?
Well, it's quite
interesting, actually.
- There you are.
- Hey, George.
This is Maya.
Maya, this is George.
- Hey.
- Hello.
Maya doesn't
overlook the vital things...
like other people.
And speaking for myself,
I'm thankful for that.
Roman tells me that he
really enjoys working for you.
Yeah. George is a protector
of rights. That's truth
- in advertising.
- I...
I need to... I need to have
a word with you. Can we...?
- I was leaving anyway.
- You just got here.
Sorry, Maya, it's, uh...
It's important.
This is funny.
Just to think...
Three Mondays ago,
I didn't know
either one of you.
- Roman, I'm concerned about you.
- It's okay.
George and I just need to...
- talk business matters.
- Yeah.
I believe...
the two of you are gonna...
get along very well.
Roman...
Roman.
Roman, wait.
Roman...
what the hell is going on?
From my point of view?
I get a call from Fritz.
Says he has
reliable information
that you turned in Carter
Johnson, collected the reward.
Here's what the prosecutor
won't tell you.
Jesus Christ, it's true.
I've been given a gift,
George.
No, you acted
utterly improperly.
I mean, you broke the law.
It so wasn't a gift, Roman.
I'm not talking
about the money.
I don't care
about the money,
fruit of the poisonous tree.
If you wanna understand
what's happening,
you're gonna have get past
all the smoke
of legal disputation.
Legal disputation?
Roman, these are
dangerous people.
You don't just
walk away from this.
Not walking away.
I'm turning myself in.
The station's on Sixth.
Roman.
I'll... I'll walk with you.
You know,
all those years of practicing...
scouring law books...
achieving technical triumphs
through loopholes
and ambiguities...
none of which
were adequate to save me
from the reality
of my present situation.
Then today, in the
middle of nowhere...
lost, had a revelation.
An insight so sweeping,
so clear.
It's me, George.
See, I didn't see it before
because I never
experienced the other side.
I'm the defendant...
and the plaintiff
simultaneously.
I file against myself,
I represent myself,
I convict myself,
hereby expanding the full
scope of the legal desert
because the judgment's built in.
The only thing left
is forgiveness,
and I grant that to myself.
An act doesn't make
the person guilty
unless the mind
is guilty as well.
Of course... Of course
I expect there'll be challenges,
as there's no precedent
or derivative
interpretations,
but the argument is sound.
The premise true.
I have no doubt
it'll be upheld by any and all
courts of law.
You're insane.
Never been more clear.
- That's what we'll argue.
- Now, watch what you say.
You don't represent me,
so the rules of confidentiality
don't apply.
My entire defense
will be based
on the unequivocal
recitation of the truth.
I know you get it, George.
You have such
a tremendous future.
It's so bright, I...
I swear, it's....
It's blinding.
Jesus.
Hello?
Of course I remember you,
that's why I gave you my card.
I... I like the idea
of starting the conversation
with how protest
is still relevant or not,
because, you know,
we approach these things
with a certain tradition,
a certain, you know, uh,
repetition of behavior,
and sometimes after
thinking through it,
we have to find
new approaches.
<i>To whom it may concern,</i>
<i>I'm returning
the reward money.</i>
<i>Taking it was wrong,</i>
<i>and I'm compelled
to remedy my mistake.</i>
<i>I did spend $5,547.27,
which I will repay.</i>
<i>I bought three suits,
size 50 regular.</i>
<i>And I did buy two pairs
of Italian loafers, size 11.</i>
<i>One black, one brown.</i>
<i>We were all formed
of frailty</i>
<i>and error.</i>
<i>Let us pardon,
reciprocally,</i>
<i>each other's folly.</i>
<i>That is the first law</i>
<i>of nature.</i>
I'm filing a federal brief
in District Nine.
