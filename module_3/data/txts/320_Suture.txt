How is it that we know who we are?
We might wake up in the night,
disoriented, and wonder where we are.
We may have forgotten where the window...
or the door or the bathroom is,
or who was sleeping beside us.
We may think perhaps that we have
lived through what we just dreamed of.
Or we may wonder
if we are now still dreaming.
But we never wonder who we are.
However confused we might be about
every other particular of our existence,
we always know that it is us,
that we are now who we have always been.
We never wake up and wonder, "Who am I?"
Because our knowledge of who we are...
is mediated by what we doctors
of the mind call our self-schemata.
The richest, most stable and most complex
memory structures we have.
They are the structures
which connect us to our pasts...
and allow us to imagine our futures.
To lose those connections
would be a sign of pathology...
A pathology called amnesia.
But it makes no sense
to begin this story here...
Without its history... its past.
So, let me take you back
to a proper beginning.
To a time before identity
has been confused.
- Let me take that.
- No, thanks. I've got it.
- Please, I insist.
- Really, Vincent, I've got it.
Happy to see you, Clay.
It wasn't the driver's fault.
He said the thing just
froze in his headlights.
You should have seen
what it did to the front end.
Incredible mess, blood everywhere.
Headlights smashed, the grill crushed...
We had to wait a hour and a half
for another bus.
- Fascinating.
- What?
We don't have deer in the city.
- Yeah, I guess you got your own problems.
- Yes.
But if by that you mean
thieves and vandals,
I'm afraid you don't
completely understand.
Crime isn't so much a problem here.
As a fact, each man has his own jungle.
It's just a matter of understanding it
and knowing where one fits in...
Knowing who are the scavengers,
who are the predators.
Take me, for example, Vincent Towers.
I'm a very wealthy man with
expensive things all around me...
And I'm forced to protect what's mine against
the people who might feed off my privilege,
Feed off what doesn't belong to them.
It's the most simple and basic of lessons.
It's the law our father lived by.
It's a shame you never knew him.
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm not exactly sure
why you brought me here.
And I get the feeling that you've got the
wrong idea about why I even contacted you.
I hope I haven't.
I just don't want you to think
that I'm after anything.
Nobody knows we're brothers...
Not my friends, not my girlfriend, no one.
And I have no plans to tell anyone.
That's completely up to you.
Thank you for honoring my wishes.
It's just when I saw you at the funeral...
To see how much we look alike.
It just didn't seem right not to,
at least, say hello and to meet you,
at least once. I just felt I had to do it.
You know, common blood.
Yes, yes, common blood.
I think I understand, Clay.
Our physical similarity
is disarming, isn't it?
Look,
the fact that we're brothers,
I just don't want you to misunderstand.
Your restraint is admirable.
Yeah, thanks.
So, this is where you
lived with our father?
Our father?
No, I only just moved here.
I chose this place for aesthetic reasons.
I'm afraid there's been a slight change
of plans for the weekend...
I haven't told you about.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
I have to take care of some business
in Los Angeles.
It came up suddenly.
I'll be back tomorrow.
But you know I gotta go back to work.
I'm only gonna be here through Sunday.
We'll have plenty of time
to talk when I return.
I'm sorry this is so sudden.
But business...
Well, business.
All right. I guess I can meet you
back here tomorrow.
Clay, you don't seem to understand.
I'm only going for the night.
You'll stay here. I insist.
My flight leaves in an hour.
It can't be helped.
I'll be back in the morning.
I apologize.
I hope you won't mind
driving me to the airport.
It'll give you a chance to see the city.
Well, then.
These clothes are for you.
I hope you won't be offended by a small gift.
A token of brotherhood.
I'm sure you're my size.
As you pointed out, our
physical resemblance is striking.
I put your dirty clothes in the hamper.
This was our father's watch.
Now that you're a member
of the Towers family,
I thought it appropriate that it be yours.
Vincent, I can't take this from you,
or these other things.
I meant what I said,
I don't want your money.
I didn't come here
to take things from you.
But I assume you didn't
come here to be rude to me.
- That's not the point.
- Clay. This is a gift, a gesture.
It's given, not taken.
Yeah, but you're doing the giving,
I'm doing the taking.
These things are meant simply as a gift.
Nothing more.
If your pride demands
that you refuse a gift, so be it.
I only thought you'd like
to feel a part of all this.
I'll be finishing up downstairs.
We haven't much time.
Clay, we've got to go. It's getting late.
- What are you looking for?
- My Saint Christopher medal.
I found the chain,
but the medallion is gone.
It was my mother's.
I don't want to lose it.
We'll find it later.
Come on. We've got to go.
Clay.
All right. All right.
I think the clothes
are a marked improvement.
I guess you would.
Now I look just like you.
Have you ever used a car phone?
I don't even know anyone here.
I often get calls in the car and I'd
appreciate it if you'd answer them.
And I may need to reach you.
All right, sure.
I hope you understand though
that this couldn't be helped.
Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.
Let me know if I can pick you up.
I don't know what time.
I'll call you tonight.
See you.
- Clay.
- Yeah.
You won't forget about the car phone?
I got it, really.
Would you prefer smoking or non-smoking?
Smoking.
And can we book your return
for you, Mr. Noland?
No, it won't be necessary.
Your seat is 3A.
Muchas gracias.
They say any motive is pure
speculation at this point.
The only known witness...
While on the moving sidewalk,
please stand to the right.
Allowing those who wish to walk
to safely pass on the left.
# And it makes #
# Bound by wild desire #
# I fell into a ring of fire #
- Hello.
- Hi.
Vincent?
Clay, I'm sorry.
- What?
- I was trapped.
There was no other way out.
What are you talking about?
I didn't know what else to do.
I'm sorry, Clay.
Vincent?
# Love is a burning thing #
# And it makes a fiery ring #
# Bound by wild desire #
# I fell into a ring of fire #
# I fell into a burning ring of fire #
# I went down, down, down #
# And the flame went higher #
# And it burns, burns, burns #
# The ring of fire #
The patient is 37 years old.
He was in a car accident three days ago
and was admitted to county hospital
semiconscious with oral bleeding.
Emergency care consisted
of a tracheostomy,
an exploration
of the right upper extremity
with fixation of fractures
of the right radius and ulna.
Surgery explored his mouth,
and the bleeding
from lacerations at the base of his tongue
and cheek was controlled.
His left eye was enucleated.
There were also complex lacerations
of the chest and right foot.
The foot was explored and found to have
extensive damage to extensor tendons.
You can see from the plain film
that the forehead is okay.
But we have some
irregularity in both orbits
and a crushed comminuted fracture
of the ethmoid sinuses.
We have a le forte three fracture here
with an unstable mid-face.
Both maxillary sinuses
are occluded with blood
and the posterior wall
is difficult to see.
The mandible has
multiple complex fractures
and is displaced to the left side.
Most of the pieces seem to be there.
Basically, he needs an open reduction and
plate fixation of an unstable mid-face.
Great, he looks like a mess. Do we know
what he's supposed to look like?
We have one photo on that driver's license
that was in his wallet.
Of course, Vincent Towers.
I thought I knew the name.
There's no family. But a Mrs. Jameson
has made herself available.
Mm-hmm. She seemed to be
an old family friend
as well as his accountant.
She wants to help with more
photographic material.
Her number is in the file.
Has there been any clear
drainage from the nose?
No.
And the C.T. Scan showed
no subdural bleeding?
Inconclusive. We've ordered another set.
- So, is he fully conscious?
- No, not fully.
He's on this corridor
if you'd like to see him now.
Yes, let's go.
It's a very well put together little popper.
Standard wares, but not crude.
If the guy in the car had been wearing
a seat belt and hadn't been thrown,
he'd be toast for sure.
This is either a pro, or somebody
who really did his homework.
- Can you trace any of this stuff?
- No.
I can build you one like it
at any five and dime.
Can you tell how it was activated?
No, but it wasn't on a timer.
Might have had a remote trigger. Could have
even been activated from inside the car.
It's all in here.
So, what's this gonna do
to your investigation?
I don't know. Damn.
Put a little pressure
on this guy and, "Boom."
Somebody tries to whack him.
I just never figured it this way.
I never figured him for being mixed-up
with somebody else.
Are you sure it was a hit?
What?
I mean, you think the guy's
a little twisted, right?
So, he scraps with his father. It gets out
of hand, he grabs a gun and shoots him.
Then, he's all torn up inside about it
and tries to kill himself.
- Suicide?
- Sure, why not?
I know you haven't been
a cop long, Joe, but suicide?
I've seen a lot of suicides.
Poisons, gas, narcotics, leaping suicides,
suicides with guns...
handguns, rifles, shotguns...
Not to mention suicides with automobiles.
But, uh, never, Joe,
never have I ever seen a suicide with a
self-activated, remote-controlled car bomb.
- Is he gonna live?
- Yeah, so they tell me.
But now his face is a mess and
that's all I've really got to go on.
- So your witness came through?
- Yeah, the bullet just grazed a nerve.
Her sight's coming back.
But now I'm not sure his face will.
And it's kind of tough
to do a lineup without a face.
Hello.
Thank you for waiting.
I'm Ren√©e Descartes.
Hello. Alice Jameson.
Uh, the entrance is right this way.
I brought the videotape of Vincent's
father's birthday party for you.
The one we spoke about.
- I hope it will be useful.
- Thank you.
What a lovely dress. I do hope
we haven't ruined your evening with this.
Oh, no, not at all.
I'm meeting friends at the opera later.
How nice. I love the opera.
That's Vincent.
I'm afraid it's a little large and
unwieldy for your purposes though
Yes, a little.
Uh, the bedroom is up there.
You will find his personal things there.
- Outside of that, you'll have to rummage.
- Oh, that's fine.
I'm afraid this is all that's left.
Vincent insisted that the remainder
of the estate be sold.
It was simply too much of a burden.
He's been tormented
by his father's murder.
You mentioned the investigation.
I read that...
Yes. The police have been
incredibly difficult about it.
It's just another instance
of Vincent being misunderstood.
He's a very sensitive person
and people tend to react negatively.
To his sensitivity?
No, to him.
He's had a... a very difficult life.
Few people have taken the trouble
to really know him.
- Are these recent?
- No, I don't think so.
The police were thinking of doing
a lineup eventually with Vincent.
And as you of course know, that's going
to be a little more difficult now.
- Here we go. This must be fairly recent.
- Yes. He won that trophy last year.
Vincent. Vincent. Vincent.
Vincent.
Vincent.
Hey, cheers.
Hello, Dr. Fuller, this is Nurse Stevens.
You might want to come down. I think we
may have a problem with Mr. Towers in 3334.
No, he regained consciousness, sort of.
That's the problem.
You'd better come down.
No, no. I'm sure if it were just
the matter of the bomb,
this policeman would not
be quite this aggressive.
I thought I told you that the patient is
the suspect in the murder case.
Yes, you did. I guess I didn't realize
it was this urgent.
May I refer him to you
the next time he calls?
That's fine. But I'd like to get some idea
of the extent of Vincent's amnesia
before we start the police badgering,
Regardless of what he may have done.
Hi. I'm, uh, Lt. Weismann.
I'm here to see Mrs. Lucerne.
- Come in. Mrs. Lucerne is expecting you.
- Thanks.
I had two birds before, Hugin and Munin.
But Hugin died when I was in the hospital.
I'm sure it was Hugin.
Everyone said they looked exactly alike.
But I always knew which was which.
I'm very good at that sort of thing.
Nothing wrong with my memory...
Never has been.
That's wonderful, Mrs. Lucerne.
Now, if you wouldn't mind taking a look
at some of the stuff I brought over.
This is a police video. It might make
the course of events that night
a little more clear for you.
Do you mind? I've been anxious
for you to see this.
Oh, not at all. The machines are over there.
But I've already told you,
I remember everything that night
just as though it were yesterday.
I've always had a very good memory.
I'm very good at that sort of thing.
I don't get it. I want to remember.
Of course you do, on a conscious level,
But it is your unconscious
that won't allow you to.
And it is your unconscious
that has taken control over your memory
for whatever reason...
The trauma of the accident
or some other repressed anxiety
it doesn't want you to remember.
And thus it has created
this barrier to your past.
And of course that it,
your unconscious, is you.
There's nothing wrong
organically with your brain.
That is what I mean when I say
you have created your own amnesia.
We can take this a bit further.
Research suggests that
your own understanding
of how and what an amnesiac forgets...
Whatever you've seen in movies or TV...
has created a pattern
by which you yourself have forgotten.
If you thought you could forget
how to talk, for example,
We might not be having
this conversation right now.
Such as it is.
This is the scene of the crime.
It's a few hours after you were taken
to the hospital.
If this makes you uncomfortable,
you let me know.
This first part isn't gonna mean much to you.
This is the inside of the house.
That's where they found Arthur Towers' body.
Now we're going outside.
That's the door he would have been
coming out of when he saw you.
Yes, I heard a window breaking,
like breaking glass.
Uh-huh.
Now, you said you were
standing next to a car.
It was probably that Ford.
Yes, that's it.
Not sure I have been dreaming.
To sleep is to dream, Vincent.
You know, in Spanish it's the same word.
Sueno.
- I have been sleeping a lot.
- Fine.
You know, the poet Auden said,
"Learn from your dreams what you lack."
I think he had something other than
amnesia in mind, but nonetheless,
you lack memories and your dreams
will help us enormously.
Try and view this as an opportunity
to explore your past.
Now, relax.
And I'll be back to see you tomorrow.
I'll be here.
What I'd mostly like
to talk to you about today,
is identifying the man you saw.
As I said, if you can identify someone,
We'd like to schedule a lineup
as soon as possible.
I was hoping
that you could look at some of these
photographs I brought for you.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
All of these men look so similar.
We chose the photographs based on
the description you gave us.
I don't think I recognize
any sort of distinction.
Photographs are so different
from real people, you know.
I once met Elizabeth Taylor in person.
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lucerne.
Any help you can give us
would be appreciated.
Well, if any of them looks right...
Yes. If any of them looks right,
it's this one. But I wouldn't say for sure.
People look different
in a photograph, you know.
It makes such a different
kind of impression.
You wouldn't want me to pretend I'm sure
if I'm not, would you?
Of course not.
Like I said, we'll, uh...
We'll be scheduling a lineup
as soon as possible.
Vincent. Vincent.
Hey, cheers.
Salt of the earth, wouldn't you say? My
secretary told me that you borrowed the tape.
- Yes, I hope you didn't miss it.
- No, no. Not at all.
I stopped by to see if you'd like to look
over some of the materials I've been using.
Uh, mainly photographs.
I would, thank you. Do you have a minute?
Well, sure, Max. What's up?
- How much have you spoken with Vincent?
- Oh, not much.
Two pre-op consultations, one post-op.
- Any opinions?
- Only medical ones.
I'd be happy to let you see
his chart if you'd like.
Really, I'd like you to try and speculate
about his personality.
You've spent enough time
with him to venture an opinion.
Max, I'm no psychiatrist.
I can fix the body,
but when it comes to the electrical
system, it's beyond me.
Well, uh,
would you say he's a congenial young man?
I wouldn't say.
Come now.
Do you have no thought about this at all?
Nothing unusual?
This is a very peculiar case.
Look, I would have to say that my impression
so far hasn't been that positive.
But all I know about him
is his background.
He has no job, he has
very expensive tastes,
he has no friends or relatives
who care to see him
and people seem to think
he killed his father.
And yet, he seems quite pleasant to me,
underneath it all.
There's a genuineness there
that's surprising.
You watched that videotape, didn't you?
Yes.
But he's not behaving as he is known to.
His personality seems
to have shifted ground.
Max, I grew up with boys like this.
They should have a complex
named after them.
And it seems to me in this case
that what you see,
is what you get.
Is this a recent photograph?
Yes. Vincent won
this competition last year.
You're a champion marksman.
So I like to hunt?
No, not that I'm aware of.
This is all about target shooting.
I'm not sure when this one was taken.
You've been traveling so much lately.
You try to make it to Paris
at least once a year to shop.
We went together this year.
Do you remember?
You took me to Maxim's.
This was made from a news photo.
It was at your father's funeral.
The stroke was pretty hard on your father.
But it didn't seem to thwart his
compulsion for social outings.
In fact, he thought that this was
the most productive, politically,
of all his birthday parties.
My father was very popular, wasn't he?
He was very powerful, Vincent.
People treated him with great respect.
I don't look like I'm having
such a great time.
You're a very rich man, Vincent.
I'm not sure if you already know that.
Look,
Dr. Shinoda wants me to be very direct
and honest with you.
He feels that you need a fair perspective.
One that will help you heal.
You've had a very tumultuous life.
I think you already know
that your father was murdered.
He was shot
in what appeared to be
an attempted robbery.
You, however, are a suspect.
- I'm gonna have to go...
- No.
No, at this moment you are only a suspect.
Sidney Callahan, your lawyer,
will fill you in with the details.
But we thought it was best
if you heard this from me.
How was he shot? I mean, where?
He was shot in the head.
Once?
No. Actually, he was shot three times.
All in the head?
Yes, Vincent. All in the head.
You identified the body.
Did he die right away?
The coroner thought so.
He was already weak from the stroke.
I'm sorry.
This must be very unsettling.
Vincent, you have the opportunity
to see your past in whatever light
you choose,
but for your future to begin,
you need to understand
the past you've created.
I'll... I'll be here, Vincent.
I'll be here to help you through this.
- I shot him in the head three times.
- Vincent.
You haven't even been
charged with the crime.
It won't be productive for you to dwell
on something we don't know yet.
Maybe this can be a new beginning for you.
Maybe even for you and me.
Three times.
I think maybe you should rest now.
Yes. You rest now.
It's not something you're going
to have to live with forever.
We'll need a second surgery
to get you really looking
like yourself again.
We may have to do some contouring changes
and there will be some scar revision.
Does that mean don't be shocked?
Oh, you won't be shocked.
You still have a very handsome face.
I think you'll be happy with the way
things are turning out.
Alice told me... Alice Jameson...
You met her, right?
Yes, I have.
Alice tells me you come from a long line
of plastic surgeons,
Something about your father
and his father.
Well, my father wrote a book.
He wasn't actually a plastic surgeon,
but my grandfather was.
What was your father's book about?
A 15th century plastic surgeon.
My father is an art historian.
It's really not very interesting.
I'm sure it would bore you.
It might.
Why would an art historian be
interested in plastic surgery?
Well, he was pursuing a theory
about Renaissance ideals of beauty,
And he came across Gaspare Tagliacozzi,
the father of rhinoplasty... nose jobs.
Well, actually, he's the father
of modern plastic surgery.
And he codified a procedure
for using a skin flap from the arm...
right about here...
to reconstruct the nose.
Do you still do skin grafts that way?
No, it was a little bit
different back then.
The arm had to stay attached to the nose
until the skin graft took.
For how long?
Ten to fourteen days. Awkward, isn't it?
You're all unwrapped. You can take a look.
You look troubled.
Remember, we're only halfway done.
Oh, no, it's... it's not that.
I just haven't...
I guess it's been a long time since
I've looked at my face in the mirror.
It's okay, really.
I guess I never expected to...
I never expected to be...
Thanks, Dr. Descartes.
It looks great.
I'm glad you're pleased, Vincent.
Why don't you call me Ren√©e?
I think we'll both like that better.
Okay, Ren√©e.
The gun that killed Arthur Towers
was the same gun that
wounded the old lady.
It's a pretty rare German number
that you don't see around much.
And guess who owned one.
Bingo. Vincent Towers.
The entire staff has always
had Wednesday evenings off
during opera season.
It's a tradition in the Towers household.
And it has been for years.
Vincent insisted that things not change
after Mr. Towers' stroke.
Whoever did this must have known that
Vincent wouldn't have been there...
I must have seen him go in
because I take all the tickets.
We have very strict rules
about that sort of thing
and I keep a close watch
to make sure that...
Vincent never had friends.
He's just the sort that doesn't mix well.
I don't see why that makes him diabolical.
He just doesn't like to socialize
and people don't take to him.
Those who know him understand that.
He's a loner.
Wonderful!
We're awfully glad you're
still here to celebrate.
Here's to a patient that's only been
a pleasure to treat. A true gemini.
Hear, hear.
It's veuve clicquot, your favorite champagne.
Taste familiar?
Thank you.
I guess it's my turn.
Here you go. It's a little heavy.
It's beautiful.
It'll need some watching, but I thought
you'd like some spring in your room.
Thank you.
Well,
I guess I'm last.
Happy birthday, Vincent.
It belonged to Grandmother Towers.
I was planning on keeping it,
but after your accident and all I...
Well, you can use it now.
I'm working the controls
of the crane again.
But I'm wearing these funny glasses
and nose, like a disguise.
I just keep working faster
and faster, like it's a race.
I can't operate the crane fast enough.
But for some reason, I stop,
jump down from the machine
and start to run fast.
But I don't know where I'm running.
But just like with the crane,
I think I'm late,
Like something's starting without me.
And then, almost to go faster,
my feet start turning into tires
and then I just turn into a car.
I don't know how I know
I'm a car, I just know it.
And no one's driving.
Hmm, a car.
Yeah, a really fancy car.
Then before you know it, I run over a nail
and one of the tires blow
and I skid into this huge wall.
Then I wake up.
Did the car seem familiar?
No. Well, maybe.
Can you talk about what that
transformation to a car felt like?
I don't know. I just turned into a car.
Vincent,
it's important for you to try and
remember every little fact or detail...
All the minutiae of your dreams.
For example, what color was the car?
How fast was the car going?
What make and model was the car?
The make and model of the car?
Let me give you an example
of how this might work.
We all know names like Chevrolet, Chrysler,
Buick, Dodge, Ford or Oldsmobile
to be names of car companies.
But think about, say, Oldsmobile.
Olds... mobile.
Old mobile...
an old person's car, an antique car.
If, for instance, the car in your dream
were an Oldsmobile...
Now, remember, Vincent,
this is a very simple example...
Could that car in some way
connect with your deep past?
A car of your father's? Your first car?
Dodge... dodging,
moving quickly, getting away.
All from the make of the car?
I don't mean to say that the manifest
content of your dreams
would necessarily have such a one-to-one
correspondence to the events of your life,
but nonetheless, it almost
always points the way.
As Freud said,
"Dreams appear like a coded puzzle."
I do remember wearing heavy boots,
like work boots,
before I turned into a car.
But there was a needle sticking
in the side of one of them
and a little trail of blood coming out.
Hmm, boots.
Good. That's very good.
- Emblem.
- Scout.
- Hide.
- Seek.

- Seed.
- Wall.

- Babel.
- Eye.
- Tooth.
Telephone.
Answer.

Wander around a little.
Try and feel what it's like to be here.
Let your body help you remember.
Don't push it if you feel fatigued.
You want a free association
with body and memory.
These rooms may very well
hold clues for us.
Just try and regard everything here as a kind
of "fodder for remembrance,"
as Shakespeare said.
I think I remember. What?
I was gonna fix the place up.
We'll have plenty of time
to talk when I return.
Clay, what are you looking for?
Where am I?
In your home. You passed out.
Do you know why?
I don't even remember coming here.
Your mind is frightened to remember.
Something here has caused it to be.
There are triggers here in your home,
memory triggers.
What memory?
Your memory, Vincent, it's here.
I promise you.
Your face looks wonderful, really.
It's remarkable.
But you haven't even
got the sutures out yet.
Ren√©e said that shouldn't
make any difference.
Well, Ren√©e's not thinking
about your safety.
The police still haven't got a clue
about that car bomb.
All the police wanna do
is put a noose around my neck.
Maybe at home I can figure out who I am...
And figure out
whether or not they're right.
Are you prepared to figure that out?
What's that supposed to mean?
Just what I said.
Maybe it's time for you to go home.
But you're going home unequipped.
You don't know what you need to know.
I don't know anything, Alice.
No. You simply can't remember.
You can't remember the man you were,
the way you were,
the actions you took, the things you did,
the things you said to me.
The way you were, Vincent,
the way you need to be.
Like you said, I can't remember anything.
But you will remember.
You will remember everything.
Did that happen in the accident?
No.
It's an old scar then?
I don't know.
It's another one of those things
I can't remember.
Hello?
Hi, Vincent. It's Ren√©e.
Is anything wrong?
No, no. I just wanted to
thank you for the flowers.
Oh, that. You're welcome. It was nothing.
It just seemed like such a cavernous and
lonely place to be going home to.
It's all right. It's not bad.
Well, it's getting better.
Hey, uh, I was thinking.
Maybe we should go out
to dinner or something.
Uh, maybe Saturday night.
I'd like that. Oh, I'm sorry.
I already have plans for Saturday night,
but we could get together earlier.
Are you free in the afternoon?
Saturday? Yeah, great.
You'll probably have better luck
thinking up something for us to do.
Okay. I'll come up with something.
Good luck settling in.
Thanks.
Ren√©e, by the way, there was
a medal on the night stand.
A medallion.
Did you see it when you
brought the flowers?
No. I don't remember anything.
Hmm.
Well, I'm sure it'll turn up.
Thanks.
I'll see you Saturday.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye-bye.
What a way to start the day, huh?
One barrel, two kills.
You're up, darling.
Pull!
I don't really think of it as a game.
More like a meditation.
You know, there's something about letting
your instincts take over from your mind,
Letting everything flow
in one easy motion.
It's a nice break from the technical
precision of surgery. Pull!
But it can be a little noisy.
- Do you ever miss?
- More than I do in surgery, but not often.
My grandfather used to say you could divide
the world into people who could read,
people who could think,
people who could write and fox hunters.
He tried his best
to make me into a fox hunter.
I don't think he ever
imagined me in Phoenix.
Pull!
Not shooting much like a champion, am I?
- Every day?
- Yeah, and in the afternoons.
And there's another guy out there
in the morning sometimes.
And the patrol cars keep cruising by.
Vincent, I know it's annoying,
but it's for your own good also.
Someone did try to kill you.
Weismann's not there for my protection.
He's there to hunt me, to hound me...
Because he thinks I'm a murderer...
And he thinks I'm gonna
take off before the lineup.
Still, it can't hurt to have
a little extra police surveillance.
- At least for a while.
- A while?
Yeah, well,
you don't have the police department
camped outside your doorstep.
Everything will turn out fine. I know it.
Yeah.
Hey.
I had a great time today.
It was fun being with you.
I had fun too.
I'm all dressed up.
I'm wearing evening clothes,
but it's like I wish I wasn't.
I feel silly, almost as if I was naked.
A car drives by and mud comes
splashing up all over my clothes.
I know I'm supposed to meet someone
at home, and I'm worried.
The mud is so sticky and thick.
Then a car stops, and I get in.
It's the same car
I've dreamed about before.
I remember thinking,
"What kind of car is this?"
That could be very important.
But before I could get out and check,
it wasn't a car anymore anyway...
It's a hospital gurney.
There are these little needles like they
use in acupuncture sticking into me.
I can't feel anything.
It's like my arm isn't my arm...
Or my leg isn't my leg.
And then it's really strange,
but I wake up.
But I'm still dreaming.
It was a dream in my dream.
But I didn't know I was still dreaming.
The alarm clock was ringing.
But it wouldn't turn off. I kept hitting
the button, but it wouldn't shut off.
Then out of nowhere,
a huge needle, a syringe,
just smashes down and stabs me in my hand.
Then I wake up and I realize where I am.
And it's my alarm clock that's ringing.
What do you think might be
important in this dream?
I don't know.
It all seems so disconnected
and unimportant.
But it all does have meaning
and it can help us.
As Freud said, "Nothing is insignificant."
You say it has meaning,
but you're not showing me anything.
Pointed objects and medical things.
That's as far as we've gotten.
Everything else is...
Dirt, junk, just run-down.
It seems like I have this fantasy life
about being poor.
It's not an altogether
improbable interpretation.
Given your near-death experience and the
pressures of the investigation against you,
you may very well unconsciously
wish to be someone else.
Maybe.
I never heard of anyone
wishing to be poor.
Hmm. I'm just suggesting
one interpretation.
It may have to do with the potential
consequences of your predicament.
Losing everything.
A prison term, for example.
I'm sorry.
Certainly, a lot of this revolves
around general anxiety,
and needles may lead us
in that direction also.
Being pointed out
at a lineup, for example.
Or the old expression, you know,
"pins and needles."
Oh, it's not about sewing, is it?
No.
It's not about sewing.
I didn't tell Dr. Shinoda this,
but I had a dream last night
that I killed my father.
All I kept feeling was hate and anger,
and I just shot him.
Vincent, it's just a dream.
You have far too elegant a nose
to have shot someone.
You have what they call a Greco-Roman
or American nose,
sleek with a small prominence
at the bridge and point.
Physiognomists were sure that people
with Greco-Roman noses
were inclined towards music and
literature and the arts.
Definitely not deviant behavior
like killing people.
- Is that supposed to make me feel better?
- Yes. And there's more.
I'm not just making this up.
I collect books on characterology
and physiognomy.
It used to be a complete science.
You have a crisp, angular jaw.
A sign of patience and refinement.
And your fine straight hair,
almost always a sign
of good mental temperament,
not to mention digestion.
And your mouth.
Thin, smooth lips, slightly open.
Lips that are a sign of an affectionate,
kindhearted and generous person.
Is there a feature for forgetfulness?
No, but you will get warts if you
don't stop worrying about it.
Vincent, you're a kind and gentle person.
You'd like to think that, but...
I know that.
I know you.
Yeah.
You know me.
Gentlemen, please do not speak
unless you're spoken to,
and with your cooperation,
this will be over quickly.
Oh, and please keep your hands
at your sides and look straight ahead.
All right, Mrs. Lucerne, you just take your
time and look at each of these men carefully.
- We're in no hurry.
- Try and be clear about what you remember,
not what Lt. Weismann would like you to.
I'm always clear about what I remember.
Number two, keep your hands at your sides.
Who looks familiar to you, Mrs. Lucerne?
I think what the lieutenant
means to ask is,
"Do any of these men look familiar?"
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
Well, I don't remember
anything about an eye patch.
Number two, please remove your eye patch.
I must say, it's uncanny how much this man
looks like the man who shot me.
Number two, please step forward
and turn to the right.
Face the opposite wall now.
Turn back toward us.
Is this man who shot you, Mrs. Lucerne?
As I told you, Lieutenant,
you cannot tell from pictures.
Looking at the photograph,
I would've thought I knew.
But now I'm not so sure. Hmm.
But you thought the picture
looked familiar, didn't you?
Yes. Yes, I did.
And there's a striking similarity there,
but he's different.
Could this possibly be the man?
- Lieutenant, this is getting...
- Mr. Callahan,
you're either going to shut up or you're
going to get the hell out of here.
The man who shot me
had very different eyes.
They were farther apart.
And his nose was different.
His ears... Were lower.
His look was just different.
I don't think this is him.
This particular man has had extensive
plastic surgery, due to an accident.
His face is going to seem...
Might seem a little unfamiliar.
Well, then how do you
expect me to identify him?
Precisely. It boggles the mind.
Look, there's your sign...
"Needles." Just like you said.
That's it. That's the sign.
I still don't get it. You've been dreaming
about every kind of needle known to man.
Why isn't Needles, California,
just another mysterious symbol?
I don't know.
But I didn't dream this. I remembered it.
Doesn't look like much, does it?
Uh-uh.
I don't know why,
but I thought it would be bigger.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
coming here.
Go on.
This place is beginning to bug me.
I like it. It's got that sort of quaint,
desert backwater charm.
It's run-down and dirty,
poor and pathetic.
You might be overreacting just a little.
Maybe.
I mean, relax.
Enjoy the air. It's so warm.
The crickets are singing for us. Listen.
It's like a death knell.
Vincent, please. You didn't do it.
But I don't want to be told that anymore.
I want to remember not doing it.
I'm gonna go to my room now.
So the needles in my dream
are the needles, this town.
I guess this is just another
meaningless code.
They are codes, yes, but not meaningless.
I cannot explain it all to you.
No one can.
I can only help you find the connection.
Lead you in a more fruitful direction.
Yeah.
It's a dirty, run-down little town
in the middle of nowhere.
I know this must be
frustrating and disturbing,
but these memories, however confusing,
are a very healthy sign.
At least your mind is struggling
with your past.
Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day.
I gotta go, Doc.
I'll see you next week.
Why don't you come back
and see me again tomorrow?
This is Captain Sparks.
What can I do for you?
- I wanna know what's going on with Weismann.
- Excuse me?
Well, am I wrong, or is
your investigation over?
You're no longer under
investigation, Mr. Towers.
Lt. Weismann has been
reassigned to another case.
Well, maybe you'll ask him what the hell
he was doing in Scottsdale yesterday...
And why he's been on my ass all morning.
Lt. Weismann is here in the office
this morning.
Maybe you'd like to
speak with him yourself.
Mr. Towers, Lt. Weismann
is working at his desk.
Maybe you'd like to speak with him.
Mr. Towers? Mr. Towers?
Uh, no.
No. Thank you.
Hello. Dr. Descartes.
- Hi. Ren√©e?
- Vincent, where are you?
Over by the Valley View Parkway.
I'm a little confused.
I think something's going on.
- What's wrong? Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
But I think I'm being followed,
and I guess it's not...
Sorry, Vincent. I dropped the phone.
I'm sorry, Vincent.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Clay.
I'm sorry, Clay.
I'm sorry, Clay.
Vincent? Vincent, are you okay?
Ren√©e,
I'm gonna go now.
I'll call you back later.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'll call you back later.
Try and relax, honey.
Yeah.
Bye.
Vincent! Vincent! Vincent! Vincent!
Vincent! Vincent!
What are you looking for?
This is 911.
I'd like to report a...
- Someone's been shot.
- What is your name and address?
I'm at 134 Crest.
Is that the location of the incident?
Yes. That's where I am.
And your name, sir?
Sir, your name?
I am Vincent Towers.
You just got finished
telling me you're Clay Arlington.
No. I told you I remember another past...
When I was Clay Arlington.
If your memory has returned,
don't you think it might be useful to
integrate that past into your life?
- Which past?
- The past you know to be your own.
It's all my past.
Who was hounded by the police?
- Who was dragged through a lineup?
- That was a terrible mistake.
When I look in the mirror,
I see Vincent Towers.
When I go to the club, people call me
Vincent Towers.
Ren√©e's in love with Vincent Towers.
Clay, we're talking
about two distinct lives.
And one is gone.
There's a dead body
that can't be identified.
And in a most real way, it's not
the body of Vincent Towers.
I am Vincent Towers.
Clay...
You're burying the wrong life.
The one that isn't dead.
This is a very dangerous game.
You've made up your mind, haven't you?
You're not going back.
No, I'm not.
Vincent, Ren√©e. Closer together.
Come on, Vincent. Let me see that
handsome mug of yours.
Perfect. Perfect. Cheese!
I held out a small hope for a while...
that Lt. Weismann
would put things together.
He tried for some time.
To this day, I do not think he believes the
story that the events finally did produce.
Too many loose ends.
But they have all been forgotten now,
and in a sense, it has all worked out
just as Clay said.
He was right.
But of course, he is ultimately wrong.
For he is not Vincent Towers.
He is Clay Arlington.
He may dress in Vincent's fine clothes,
drive Vincent's expensive car,
play golf at Vincent's country club...
Or use Vincent's box at the opera.
But this will not make him Vincent Towers.
He can never be Vincent Towers...
Simply because he is not.
Nothing can change this.
Not the material comforts
his life may afford him,
nor the love Ren√©e may provide.
And if, by some chance,
over the cries of his true ego,
he is able to achieve happiness,
it will be false, empty.
For he has buried
the wrong life, the wrong past.
Buried his soul.
He has lost all that
makes life worth living.
Of this, we can be completely certain.
