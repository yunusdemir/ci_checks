THE MAN WITHOUT A PAST
Written, directed and produced by
AKI KAURISMÃ„KI
Bingo!
Lajunen, from the gents.
We have a dead man here.
His pulse is fading.
We're losing him.
Perhaps it's better this way
than a life as a vegetable.
5.12 a.m.
What is the deceased's name?
- We don't know.
Notify the morgue.
I'm needed at the maternity ward.
Is he dead?
No, he's moving.
See you outside?
- In a minute.
What should we do?
Take him to the hospital?
I don't know.
He's run away from
the prison mental hospital.
We'll ask him when he's better.
Until then, we'll let him rest.
- You're the boss.
Yes.
Get some eggs and milk.
Don't stay out all evening.
Thank you.
So he can talk. - Sure.
I just haven't had
anything to say be fore.
You're kind.
- I don't know about that.
We've been luck y... this place
and a job for Nieminen.
What does he do? -He's a night-
watchman at the coal yard.
Just a couple of nights
a week, but still.
We can soon apply for
a council flat.
They'll be taking in new
applications in a year or two.
That is fine. - What are you?
I don't know. - You don't know?
My head's damaged somehow.
I don't even remember who I am.
My, that's bad.
Care for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
It's Friday.
Let's go out for dinner.
Oh what joy!
I have found a friend
My sins are washed away
I'm always blessed by my friend
He brings sweet peace
To my soul
He comforts me
When the road is rough
My Saviour walks close to me
I'm freed from misery and sorrow
As long as Jesus I follow
He's a faithful friend
Will you have a beer
if I buy you one?
I'll take offence and turn mean
if you refuse.
Or are you an anti-alcoholic?
Don't think so. As far as I know.
I got paid today.
Not much but enough -
for us to have two beers
without Kaisa noticing.
Perhaps.
Two beers.
I'm paying.
A seagull.
An ashtray.
A stub.
A Taunus.
Eight times eight?
Sixty-one.
- Seventy-two.
A woman.
- You make jokes, that's good.
Never give up, even if
you've lost your memory.
Life goes on, not back wards.
You'd be in trouble if it did.
How much do you remember?
I was on a train.
It was dark outside.
- And before that?
It's all black. - Your childhood?
Not a sound, just a gloomy night.
- Your name? Your age?
Forget it.
I was on a train, that's all.
What about Helsinki?
Are you from here?
Don't think so.
The city seems strange to me.
Another round?
Maybe there's a blood clot -
in the part of your head
where the memory is.
Alcohol will dissolve it.
- You have one. Bring me water.
I used to do a lot of drinking when
I was younger, before my marriage.
I could drink for two days in a row.
But you're young only once.
Workman's hands.
You've done something.
Something simple, you don't
look like a reading man.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
I'll get that beer.
Hey, mate!
Missed.
Just a thought.
I saw a film as a child -
where a man got his memory back -
when struck again in the same spot.
I see. - Yes.
Thank s for the beer.
I'll take a walk now.
You're welcome. It gave me
the excuse to drink eight.
I may get a whipping
at home, though.
Stand up for yourself. See you.
She won't hit in front of the kids.
Ciao.
This is the man.
This here's Anttila.
The Whip of God. To my friends.
What sort of a man are you?
He doesn't know.
Found on the beach -
some sort of driftwood.
- Let the man speak for himself.
This is a private beach
but if you have a cigarette -
I can let it go. For once.
All I have is roll-ups.
- Then it means prison.
Your interests may be mutual.
He needs a place to stay.
That'd make a difference.
If you lived here -
I naturally wouldn't arrest you.
- Got one?
What? -A place to rent?
Does a bird have wings,
does a wolf cry out his loneliness?
Erik son's container's empty.
- Where is he?
Froze to death last winter.
All this is unofficial, of course.
If the authorities ask anything -
I shall deny you thrice like Peter
denied Christ at the coal fire.
As it happens I don't
even know who I am.
Then we must do an oral
agreement. A hundred.
A month? -A week.
Paid in advance each Monday.
It's not cheap.
- I must make a living, too.
Many people would pay triple
for a sea view.
And you don't look like
you'd last the winter.
You seem to be quite plump yourself.
Keep my metabolism out of this.
What about the electricity?
- Included in the rent.
There's the power company pylon.
I can lend you a screwdriver.
When can I move in?
- As soon as I turn my back.
And the keys?
- You see a lock any where?
No. - Don't go splitting hairs
then or I'll take the door, too.
A month's rent, in advance.
- Tomorrow, God willing.
He moves in mysterious ways.
If you don't pay up -
I'll send my killer dog
to bite your nose off.
It only causes trouble any way,
shadows the way wherever I go.
It's no more smoking
in the shower for you. Bye.
May I take this? -Go ahead.
Thanks.
What do I owe you?
- If you see me -
face down in the gutter,
turn me onto my back.
Kaisa promised you a mattress.
We've an extra one.
A jukebox.
Won't work.
These were left over.
It should work now.
The soup had too little salt in it.
Perhaps the rain watered it down.
There was cabbage
and potatoes, any way.
What more do you want?
Meat? -Never.
Good it was. What's your name?
Angling for another plateful?
No chance.
You look lousy, by the way.
I've had misfortunes but I'll
overcome them in a couple of days.
Visit us. You need new clothes.
Looking like that, no one'll take
you seriously. - So I've noticed.
And try to pull yourself together.
Bye now, I must hurry.
I was told to pull my self together.
Know how to do the washing?
Never bothered to learn,
Kaisa's always seen to it.
So far.
Nor do we have a washing machine
as I don't have any credit.
But the neighbour has one
'cause he's wealthy.
Come in!
I'd make some coffee
but I ain't got none.
Thanks, but I'm in a hurry.
How are you?
If the garbage collectors'
strike continues -
I must go on a diet or move away.
Where's this village's Employment
Agency? -See that church tower?
Follow its shadow and you're there.
- Excellent!
Isn't it? Now, if you'll allow me.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
Surely you know how
to write your name? -Yes.
But these questions...
- I'll help you. It's not difficult.
Your surname, both given names -
date and place of birth,
social security number.
Can I help?
Wait here.
Are you making fun of us?
Surely you have a name?
Course I do. I was hit on the head,
several times in fact.
That's why I can't...
remember everything.
Why don't you ask your
mother or your friends?
Every one around here has
friends. - I've got one too.
But he doesn't know either.
- Did he hit his head too?
The Drama School's
round the corner -
they might have some use for you.
Don't waste our time again!
Some people want to work.
- What about social assistance?
They want a name, too.
Now get out of my sight.
Drugs you can find on the streets.
Do you charge for it?
- Not for the water.
Go ahead.
Leftovers from lunch.
You look hungry.
- I've got no money.
Doesn't matter.
It goes to waste otherwise.
Do you drink milk?
You came for the clothes.
I came because
you gave me the address.
But it's no use, I can't buy
anything. I'm an outcast.
That's no news to us.
You pay back when you're
back on your feet again.
All these are donations. You won't
get ahead looking like that.
God's mercy reigns in heaven -
but here on the Earth
one must help oneself.
The fitting-room's in the corner.
You'll go far yet.
You don't look like a drunk.
Like to tell me what
happened to you?
If you tell me your name.
I asked it once already -
and in my present situation
I'm afraid to talk to strangers.
It's Irma.
Wait in there.
There's a wretched man out there.
I think we should help him.
All right. Ask him in.
These need to be sorted
and carried inside.
Jokinen will help you to start.
Jokinen.
Looks cosy. Perhaps
I should raise the rent.
That's what I wanted to talk about.
I can't pay until Friday.
Attack!
You were lucky.
Usually people end up dead.
Start to pack.
The money will be there.
As certainly as death.
That's what gets you
if you fail to pay.
I've become so ft.
I'll drive my self
out of the business.
I'll be in Tallinn for a week.
The dog stay s here, watching you.
He only eats raw meat.
- I'll take care of him.
He takes care of himself.
Don't try to pet him -
or you've thrown your last dart.
Does he have a name?
Hannibal.
As our work is based on charity
we cannot pay you -
the kind of salary private
employers do. - I understand.
Sign here.
Will a cross do?
Do you live some where?
- I've got a home, in a dormitory.
May I escort you there?
The streets are not safe these days.
It's not far, I can manage.
- I'm sure you can.
I was thinking of myself.
I'm afraid of the dark.
It's not proper, with a stranger.
- But we are colleagues.
All right, let's go.
Is this where you live? -Yes.
Thank you for escorting me.
I wasn't afraid for a moment.
- That's fine.
Look out! -What?
There's something in your eye.
I can't feel anything.
- It's just going in there.
Let me have a look.
You stole a kiss. - Forgive me.
I'm not a gentleman.
Will we see each other tomorrow?
Without doubt, if you come to work.
Good night.
Satisfactory.
Hannibal. Here, boy.
He's a girl. - The man
who sold it said he's a male.
He'd better return the money.
No wonder he's no good.
Ho w was the trip to Estonia?
- I achieved my goals.
Can I borrow your car
for Saturday night?
I've never lent any one
anything in my life.
Twenty per hour, plus petrol.
Greed is a mortal sin.
I run a business.
The State protects business.
The State does not sin. Quo vadis.
Reservation fee's fifty.
Are you sure I can't help?
- I think it's ruined already.
Any way, it's ready.
Do you cook often?
Not very often.
The peas were fine.
- I went to the moon yesterday.
I see. How was it? -Peaceful.
Meet any one?
- Not really, it was a Sunday.
Is that why you came back?
- Yes. And for other reasons, too.
Are you pretending -
or don't you really
remember anything?
I do remember something...
A factory hall -
by a long straight stretch
of a highway.
I did something.
A bright flame, it's hot...
It may be a dream.
I've started having them again.
- That's a good sign.
Perhaps.
The thought of a grave
with no name...
Shall we sit on the couch
and listen to some music?
The spring of God
Is never dry
You can drink and
slake your thirst
It's filled with
The Water of Life
Always cool,
clear and bright
My spring of Life
never seems to dry
It's never touched
by the droughts of Time
My soul, oh...
With all due respect, guys.
Haven't you ever thought of
expanding your repertoire -
into rhythm music? -Why?
This is what we always play.
I've got records at home.
bues, R&B, rock'n'roll.
Come and listen, if you want.
Why not-in our free time.
Around here the music
code is pretty strict.
I can have a word upstairs.
Regeneration would be fine.
We've heard about rock.
By widening your repertoire -
you may reach new target
groups who then -
with time may find
the movement interesting.
And I do believe -
that while the guys' new style
is in part worldly -
it might be beneficial
to the movement.
So far, music hasn't killed any one.
We could give it a try.
I used to do some singing
my self when I was younger.
Let's go.
Because tomorrow is Midsummer -
although originally a pagan feast -
our choir will now make
an exception -
and perform a song
about the human heart.
In its lyrics, however,
we discover thoughts -
of the futility of our worldly
life without Christ.
So small is the heart of man
So vast, uncharted land
Within it you find
The grandest dreams
The worlds of hate and love
The wealth of all joy,
The sum of all sorrows
Glorious love and
Pain's poisonous arrows
All can be found
In the smallest of hearts
Happiness, joy, oh!
Shallow thoughts
And noble ideals
Burning emotions
And frozen feelings
All those can be found
In the smallest of hearts
All that fate brings by
I wonder if this was
a wise thing to do.
God knows, but let them dance.
Will you come out with me
on Saturday?
We are out now.
I've got a car, too.
I can't set up shady meetings
during working hours.
But it's all right.
So s mall is the he art of man
So vast, uncharted land
Within it you find
The grandest dreams...
Where do you want to go?
- Into the woods.
I have a basket for mushrooms.
Let's take Hannibal, too,
shall we? -Of course.
She'll protect us from the wolves.
Well?
Are these eatable?
Some are.
This one, though,
is lethally poisonous.
Indeed.
It was a good catch, wasn't it?
It'll make a meal.
Now what? -We'll go and
check the guys out.
I got them a gig.
I've been thinking about
becoming a rock'n'roll manager.
You're very energetic nowadays.
You've regained your joy of life.
I feel strong because
you inspire me.
It's all mercy.
I'm haunted by the devil,
Down the corner, every street
Wherever I may ramble,
He is always there to greet
He's staring at me calmly
In the bottom of my glass
He's smiling at me wicked
With the lips of an unknown lass
I'm haunted by the devil,
Every day and every night
Wherever I may ramble,
He is always by my side
Just when I think
I don't have to worry any more
If he's not behind me,
He's knocking on the door
Go d, please help me,
Keep me in the line
Through the straight and narrow
Would you always kindly sign
God, please help me,
would you be my guide
Please, don't let me be tempted,
keep me aw ay from the darker side
The shadow's always covering
the warm side of the sun
Waiting for the night to spoil
The dreams of every one
If I show a happy face
And even s mile to day
The luck is changing,
Game is different almost everyday
Tickets.
What do you mean?
- You haven't paid.
But I organised this.
That's what you think.
- Is that so?
Yes. - Fancy that.
That's outrageous!
- It is, isn't it?
May I give it a try, too?
- Go ahead.
We've got work for you.
Report in the office -
and start next Monday at seven.
I don't care if you say
your name's -
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
and say you were born -
in the deserts of Egypt
as long as I get -
what I need for the taxes
and pension payments.
That's all the state cares
about, and I even less.
Every other worker comes
from Kirghizia now -
and changes e very two week s.
But you need a bank account.
Can't you pay me in cash,
like in the old days?
And how do you suppose
the banks would survive?
No one could control the way
you spend your money.
You'd be like a pig in
a barley field, with no control.
But I have this name problem.
We'll find a name for you.
Don't be so helpless!
Open a numbered account -
in Switzerland and come back.
Good day. How are you?
Not too good. How can I help?
I want to open an account.
Fill this in.
You don't understand.
They ask my name.
I mean a numbered account -
like they have in Switzerland.
This one'll have a number too,
but you need a name any way.
Switzerland's more liberal,
but here in Finland...
Where's e very one?
This is a small bank,
there's no one else.
I'd like to take out 247,000
from this account.
The money is there -
but the account is frozen. - I know.
What's that?
A security camera, but...
It doesn't work.
Not any more, any way.
Start counting the money.
I haven't got that much here,
I must get it from the vault.
You come with us.
Be careful, I don't want too much.
Don't worry, I know my work.
There will be no extra money.
I'd have to pay it back my self.
I must close the door to give
me a head start. I'm sorry.
Perfectly understandable
in your position.
It's good you understand.
Now stay there.
It didn't work out then.
What? -Opening the account.
Wouldn't have made
any difference.
This is the last day
we're open. - Why?
The whole bank was
sold to North Korea.
What did the bank manager say?
- Nothing.
He decided on a personal solution -
being fired after 38 years' service.
One year be fore retirement age.
I see. - Yes.
We're running out of oxygen.
The air conditioning was cut off
for financial reasons.
Luckily the police will come
immediately after the alarm.
What alarm?
So we'll die here.
We can always just breathe out.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Does a tree mourn for a fallen leaf?
You're not making much sense.
It was nice meeting you.
- The pleasure was all mine.
This won't take long.
We just need some in formation.
Besides refusing to reveal
his identity -
the questioned had
no identity papers.
Under the circumstances,
the records of the hearing -
have not been signed by him,
despite repeated requests.
There fore we have decided
to arrest him until his identity -
and possible involvement
in the crime has been solved.
Got your memory back yet?
- Not yet.
We don't suspect you
of participation in the crime.
The bank clerk's story
was quite straightforward.
Then I can go, can't I?
The Vagrancy Act
has been revoked -
but we have rules and
regulations to keep you here.
You could be a foreigner.
- But I speak Finnish.
You people learn fast.
You don't look Finnish.
How did you get into the country?
Just a moment.
I believe I've got a right
to make one phone call.
You've been watching too many films.
Who'd you call, any way?
- My girlfriend.
You've been busy, haven't you?
I guess she has a name?
- Not for you.
Inkeri speaking.
Irma!
It's for you.
Hallo?
Criminal Law, chapter 16, section 4:
A person commits
insubordination by refusing -
to give the police
particulars stated in -
subsection 10 of the Police Act.
If the law does not require
a harsher punishment -
he must be sentenced to a fine -
or to a maximum of
three months in prison -
for insubordination.
What do you say to that?
He says nothing. I am his lawyer -
and will represent
the suspect from now on.
That section of the law -
only applies if you
can prove that my client -
did it deliberately
and with premeditation.
This is not the case, however,
because it was due to -
a probably temporary loss of
memory caused by violence.
The 1920 Supreme Court ruling -
number 116 states that
by holding him in custody -
for more than 48 hours the police -
are not only guilty of misconduct -
but also of deprivation of freedom.
Following my advice
my client has, however -
refrained from filing a suit -
if set free immediately -
and no other action
against him will be taken -
because of this incident.
Chapter 8, paragraph 2
of the Mental Health Act -
enables an involuntary committal
to a psychiatric hospital -
due to an obvious need caused by
a serious mental disturbance -
failure of which action would
radically worsen his condition.
Subsection 3 makes that
clearly applicable only if -
no other mental health services
are usable in his case.
To be able to apply the law -
you should have within
48 hours procured -
a doctor's referral for observation.
May I see one?
Please leave us for a moment.
You can wait in the corridor.
That's it then. For now.
Stay away from further trouble,
especially from the law.
Here's a cigar for you.
Who sent you?
- The Salvation Army.
It's you.
I followed you from
the police station. - Why?
To apologise. I got you in trouble.
I was in trouble already.
I thought you might
do me a favour, for a fee.
I had an earthmoving firm.
I bought two new machines -
and then everything
collapsed, you remember.
The bank called in my loan -
getting rid of "unreliable clients".
The machines were sold
to the bank below cost.
Three week s later the bank -
sold them for three
times that much.
You understand what I'm saying?
- More or less.
When my account
was suddenly frozen -
I could not pay the salaries -
for men who'd already
done their job.
I had to let them go -
and still owed them money.
Can a man stand that? -No.
No.
I agree.
So I did what I did.
The money was mine any way.
Will you do me the favour?
- What is it?
Too many people here.
Let's talk in some other place.
The sums and the names
are on the envelopes -
and the in formation
where you can find them.
I come from the North,
and we pay our debts.
Here.
And this is for you.
Why don't you do it yourself?
- Too risky.
The police know who did the robbery.
In that case this is not
the safest place for you.
Doesn't matter, any more.
Will you do it? -Yes.
Tell the boys I'm sorry
for what happened -
but there it is.
You'd better go no w.
WHO IS THIS MAN?
BANK ROBBER REFUSES
TO REVEAL HIS NAME
Rather small potatoes.
The weather was bad.
But they'll make a soup.
When did you plan to make it?
- Why so interested?
I have an onion.
You need it for the soup.
I've got eight potatoes.
I must save three for the winter -
and at least two as seed potatoes.
We farmers must think
of the coming years, too.
We only eat what is left over.
There's not enough for three,
I want to invite Irma to dinner.
So none for me? -Right.
You're selfish. - I'm a realist.
You city people are
children of the moment.
You might be a city man yourself.
- With a harvest like this? Never.
Give me half a potato, for scurvy.
I won't survive without teeth.
Must go.
We've discovered your identity.
- Really?
We leaked your photo to the press
and your wife contacted us today.
My wife... - Yes.
Your name is Jaakko Antero Lujanen.
Does it sound familiar?
Are you sure? -Yes.
You are a metal worker from Nurmes.
What did you say about a wife?
- She's absolutely certain.
The local police
showed her your photo.
I don't know why your
disappearance wasn't reported.
If you do have a wife...
some where there -
you must return home.
I don't want to.
Marriage is sacred.
I brought the train schedules.
Will you stay a moment longer?
It wouldn't be proper -
especially now
that you're married.
You could help me to pack.
But you have nothing.
- That's why.
Let's just sit, quiet.
I made you sandwiches.
Your home is so far away.
You won't forget...
The child of sorrow?
How could I?
You were my first love.
That was beautifully said. - Yes.
Go now.
It's time.
Hi.
Hi.
Is your mother home?
You always were
lousy at flattery.
Did you wait for me? -For years.
Forgive me for asking but...
Did we fight a lot?
You really don't remember
much, do you?
Not a thing.
We did. More and more.
It led to a divorce.
I don't understand.
Did I drink too much?
- No, not at all.
You never touched a drink.
- I didn't?
Instead you gambled.
Fruit machines, pin-ball machines,
poker, anything.
You lost all your LPs
playing blackjack.
Then what happened?
- We carried on for a time.
Your guilt complexes
made you speechless.
I wasn't much better my self.
Finally we slept in separate rooms.
Go on.
We filed for divorce.
You went south after a job -
and I never heard from you.
Until I saw you in the paper.
Suddenly you were famous.
A photo and all.
Now what?
The divorce came through in June.
I would've sent you the papers -
but you left me no address.
When you never called -
I thought you didn't care.
- I'm sorry.
I got beaten up.
I'd have written if
I'd known about you.
I'm Ovaskainen.
Lujanen.
Shall we fight, then? -Why?
I love that woman. - That's good.
She seems to like you, too.
What do you mean? -Nothing.
Nothing? -Yes.
So no demands?
- Why should I have?
Love each other as
you would love yourself.
Talk properly.
We are divorced.
Seems like things weren't
too good earlier, either.
So we don't need to fight?
- I don't see any reason for it.
I guess you're a better man
than what I've heard.
I'll let that one pass.
Just one request.
Be good to her. - OK. Sure.
Want a ride to the station?
- Yes, please.
Now that all's been settled -
you can say goodbye
to her, if you want.
Your sake, sir.
Thank you.
I thought we already
killed that one once.
So you decided to come back.
Obviously.
What's this?
They get what they deserve.
They've beaten up many of us.
Us? -Yes.
I'll call for an ambulance,
but not too soon -
if you don't mind.
Shall we go?
Where to? -Where were you going?
Home.
There's a social evening
in the canteen.
I remember the prettiest of parks
The wonderful Monrepos
My dr ams often take me back
To that leafy fairy land
The prettiest arched bridges
The loveliest moonlit nights
I have seen in the park
of Monrepos
Back to the by gone times
My thoughts again they fly
The days of the past
The wondrous tales that last
Still come alive in my mind
I remember the beautiful park
The wonderful Monrepos
Forever I've hidden
In my he art the park
Of Monrepos
My thoughts again return...
You did not stay away
for long. - No.
For a moment I was afraid.
- For no reason.
