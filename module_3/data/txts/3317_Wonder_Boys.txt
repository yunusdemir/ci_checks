The young girl sat perfectly
still in the confessional...
...listening to her father's boots
scrape like chalk...
...on the ancient steps
of the church...
...then grow faint,
then disappear altogether.
She could sense the priest..."
<i>On that particular Friday afternoon,
last February...</i>
<i>...I was reading a story to my advanced
writer's workshop by one James Leer...</i>
<i>...junior lit major and sole
inhabitant if his own gloomy gulag.</i>
"-- she bit the flesh of her lip,
closed her eyes...
...mute."
<i>James ' stories were
about as sunny as his disposition.</i>
<i>I was distracted.</i>
<i>Maybe it was the fact that
my wife had left me that morning.</i>
So, anyone?
<i>Maybe not.
Wives had left me before.</i>
Kerri?
<i>As usual, James ' classmates,
aware of a writer's vulnerability...</i>
<i>...offered their sensitive,
gentle opinions.</i>
I mean, Jesus,
what is it with you Catholics?
All right! All right.
Let's try to be constructive here.
Howard, what about you?
I hated it.
His stories make me
want to kill myself.
That's not what I meant
by being constructive.
Yes, Hannah?
I think we're missing the point.
<i>GRADY: Hannah Green. A talented
writer, who rented a room in my house.</i>
<i>I knew her to be insightful,
kind and...</i>
<i>...compulsively clad
in red cowboy boots.</i>
<i>I had never once seen her
without them.</i>
He respects us enough to forget us
and that takes courage.
Well-put, Hannah.
A good note to end on, I think.
Don't forget about Wordfest
this weekend.
Those of you driving VIPs
to the party this evening...
...should have them at the
chancellor's house no later than 5:30.
Thank you for that.
Is he all right?
I think so. How about you?
Me? Yeah. Why?
Just checking.
Turn off the light, please.
<i>GRADY: It felt good to be in the car.
Alone.</i>
<i>Where I could clear my head.</i>
<i>Tonight was the opening of Wordfest,
the university's annual gabathon...</i>
<i>...for writers and wannabes.</i>
<i>My editor, Terry Crabtree,
was flying in for the event.</i>
<i>He alone had championed my last novel,
Arsonist's Daughter...</i>
<i>...and its critical success
had put us on the map.</i>
<i>But that was seven years ago and
I still hadn't finished my follow- up.</i>
<i>Terry didn't give a rat's ass
about Wordfest.</i>
<i>He was coming to town to get a look
at my long-overdue book.</i>
<i>I had to keep him at bay.</i>
- Tripp!
- Crabtree, how are you, my friend?
- It's good to see you, Tripp.
- Let me help you.
Say hello to my new friend,
Miss Antonia....
- Sloviak.
- Nice to meet you. This way.
I invited Antonia
to tonight's festivities.
The more the merrier.
Terry told me about you on the plane.
It was so interesting.
I explained how a book gets published.
What you do, what I do.
I sweat blood for five years,
and he corrects my spelling.
- That's exactly what he said.
- We know each other pretty well.
And, actually, it's seven years.
You know how many times
I've boarded a plane, praying...
...that some gal like her
would be sitting beside me?
- She's a transvestite.
- You're stoned.
- She's still a transvestite.
- So how's the book?
It's fine. It's done.
Basically. I got a little tinkering
I still gotta do, you know.
I was hoping I could look
at it over the weekend.
That'll be tough.
I'm at a critical juncture.
I thought you were just tinkering.
I am, but I have little details
I've got to work on.
I'm not gonna pressure you.
I mean, I get pressure, you know?
You know what I mean?
What in the hootenanny
do you suppose that would be?
That would be a tuba.
You didn't purchase this car, did you?
No, I got it from Jerry Nathan.
- He owed me some money.
- He owes God money.
Including my commission
on that faux novel of his.
That perfume, Antonia, wouldn't
happen to be Cristalle, would it?
- Yes, it is. How did you know?
- Lucky guess.
<i>GRADY: The Wordfest kickoff party was
at Sara and Walter Gaskell's house.</i>
<i>She was the chancellor, which meant
she oversaw the university.</i>
<i>Her husband, Dr. Gaskell, was the
chairman of the English department...</i>
<i>... which meant he oversaw me.</i>
Isn't that a nice greenhouse?
That's Mrs. Gaskell's.
It's her hobby.
I thought you were her hobby.
Piss off, will you, Crabs?
I lost a wife today.
You'll find another.
She'll be young, beautiful.
They always are.
Hello, everyone.
Terry, good to see you again.
Chancellor, don't you look ravishing.
Whoa, easy.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I don't know how
anyone can walk in these shoes.
Practice.
I don't believe we've met.
Antonia Sloviak.
Poe. Poe.
Poe, stop! Poe!
That wouldn't be Walter's dog?
Poe!
- Who's he barking at now?
- Still at me. He's blind.
You can stop this.
Honestly.
- I need to talk to you.
- I need to talk to you too.
Help me take these coats
to the guest room, professor.
I'd be happy to
if I knew where the guest room was.
I could show you.
Terry.
We'll make ourselves at home.
We'll let Poe show us around.
Thanks.
That's new, isn't it?
Walter just got it back
from the framer.
You first.
- This morning--
- I'm pregnant.
I'm sure.
Well, that's, that's very surprising.
Does Walter know that....
I think Walter would find this
a little more than surprising.
Emily left me this morning.
She's left before.
She's left the room before,
but she's always come back.
So....
I guess we just divorce our spouses,
marry each other and have this baby.
Simple.
Yeah, right. Simple.
Is that Cristalle?
Mm-hm.
Oh, God, I wear the same scent
as a transvestite.
She is a transvestite?
If she's not now, Terry will make
sure she is by the end of the evening.
Has he asked you about the book yet?
- Yes.
- And?
Are you gonna tell him?
No. Maybe.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Me either.
DiMaggio's record for hits
in consecutive games...
...is probably
the most impressive feat in sports...
...and in my opinion, won't be broken.
Come here, big guy.
His condition's so sad.
But even blind he gets around.
<i>I don't drink...</i>
<i>...normally...</i>
<i>...but this was turning out
to be one fucked- up day.</i>
<i>And now I found myself in close
proximity to Sara's husband...</i>
<i>...and his dog, Poe.</i>
- I see you've met my friend.
- Yes, she's charming.
<i>Despite his much-vaunted
Harvard education...</i>
<i>...Dr. Walter Gaskell didn 't have
a clue about his wife and me.</i>
DiMaggio represented, metaphorically
of course, the husband as slugger.
<i>Poe had been onto me since day one.</i>
In fact, I personally believe...
...that every woman in some way
desires to be Marilyn Monroe.
Oh, I couldn't agree more.
Sure, I've had a lot of successes
over the years....
<i>GRADY:
Q.</i>
<i>Q was rich. Q was famous.</i>
<i>Q completed a novel every 18 months.</i>
<i>I hated him.</i>
-- my finest work vanished in less
than five. I find myself conflicted.
Ask him if he's conflicted
about his house in the Hamptons.
- Grady.
- Well, professor.
Q, for your information...
<i>...Hannah has two stories published
in The Paris Review...</i>
...so you'd better dust off
your A material.
You didn't tell me you were a writer.
You didn't ask.
How did you feel about the adaptation?
Grady. Douglas Triddley, Amherst.
<i>I've had Arsonist's Daughter
on my syllabus for three years.</i>
No wonder it's still in print.
<i>WOMAN:
Long time since Arsonist's Daughter.</i>
There you are.
I could've sworn I had a bottle
of 1975 Lafite-Rothschild for Q.
Given that he'll be addressing
500 people in an hour--
- You want to keep Q happy.
- If he's happy, I'm happy.
James?
It's fake. It was my mother's.
She won it in a penny arcade
in Baltimore...
...when she went to Catholic school.
Well, that's very convincing.
I used to shoot
these little paper caps...
...but they don't make them anymore,
the caps.
It's just for good luck, you know.
Some people carry rabbit's feet.
You carry firearms.
No, thank you.
I don't like
to lose control of my emotions.
I'm not supposed to be here,
in case you were wondering.
The other night, I was out with Hannah
at the movies...
...and she asked me, since she was
coming, so I ended up coming too.
- You and Hannah are seeing each other?
- No!
- What gave you that idea?
- James, relax.
I'm not her father.
I just rent her a room.
She likes old movies, like I do.
That's all.
What's the movie you saw?
<i>Son of Fury with Tyrone Power
and Frances Farmer.</i>
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
- Sounds like a good one.
- It wasn't bad.
You're not like my other teachers,
Professor Tripp.
You're not like my other students,
James.
Look, James, about this afternoon
in workshop.
I'm sorry.
I think I let things get out of hand.
They really hated it. I think they
hated it more than the other ones.
- Well....
- It only took an hour to write.
Really? That's remarkable.
I have trouble sleeping.
While I'm lying in bed
I figure them out...
...the stories.
- You cold, James?
- A little.
Why don't we go inside?
It's colder in there.
I guess you're right.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse.
I thought I'd come outside and take
a look at it. It looks like heaven.
Looks like heaven?
I saw a movie once.
Part of it took place in heaven.
Everyone wore white.
Lived in crystal houses like that.
I really should be going.
- Goodbye, Professor Tripp.
- Hey, James.
James, don't go. No.
There's something I want you to see.
I'll miss my bus.
It's worth it.
Trust me.
Let me help you with that.
Thank you, dear. Thank you.
Come on.
Hey, you two.
- James, are you riding with me?
- No.
No, he's going with me.
Why don't you take Crabtree
and his friend, all right?
- All right.
- Where are they, anyway?
Here we are!
Well, hello there.
- This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
- James.
- James will know about George Sanders.
- George Sanders?
Mr. Crabtree said he
killed himself...
...but he couldn't remember how.
Pills, April 25th, 1972,
in a Costa Brava hotel room.
How comprehensive of you.
James is amazing.
He knows all the movie suicides.
Tell him.
- There are so many.
- Well, just a few. The big ones.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills.
Donald "Red" Barry, shot himself
in 1980.
Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again.
Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think.
In a car.
Supposedly it was an accident,
but, you know, he was distraught.
Dorothy Dandridge, pills, 1965.
Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself.
He wrote his suicide note
in lipstick on his stomach.
William Inge, carbon monoxide,
1973.
Carole Landis, pills, I forget when.
George Reeves, Superman on TV,
shot himself.
Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979.
Everett Sloane, he was good, pills.
Margaret Sullavan, pills.
Lupe Velez, a lot of pills.
Gig Young, he shot himself and his
wife in 1978. There are tons more.
- I haven't heard of most.
- You did them alphabetically.
That's just how my brain works.
Fascinating. Come out
with us after the lecture.
To a place I get Tripp to take me.
- I just want to go home.
- Don't be silly.
No one your age wants to go home.
Faculty will be present.
Just consider it a field trip.
Is that really it?
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day.
So I'm told.
Go ahead.
Really?
Really.
She was small.
Most people don't know that.
The shoulders are so small.
So perfect.
I bet that's the only time
she wore it.
That day.
She must've felt so happy.
Must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I guess.
Walter never tells Sara the truth
about what he pays for these things.
You're really good friends
with the chancellor, aren't you?
Pretty good.
I'm friends with her husband too.
You must be if you know
the combination to his closet...
...and he doesn't mind you being
in here. In their bedroom.
Right.
Beverly, stay close to me
in case it gets slippy, okay?
We better skedaddle.
James....
You all right, James?
I'm sorry, Professor Tripp.
Maybe it's...
...seeing that jacket
that belonged to her.
It just looks really lonely...
...hanging there in a closet.
Maybe I'm just a little sad tonight.
I'm a little sad tonight too, James.
You mean...
...with your wife leaving you?
Hannah mentioned something about it.
Yeah, well, it's complicated, James.
I think we should go now.
Easy, easy. You're a good boy, Poe.
Poe's a good boy.
Easy, Poe. Easy.
Good dog.
Jesus Christ!
Get off me, you son of a bitch!
Shit, James.
You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
But I had to, didn't I?
You could've pulled him off me.
No, the dog was crazy,
Professor Tripp.
- The dog was attacking you!
- Calm down.
- What was I supposed--
- Calm down. Don't freak out.
Okay. All right.
Do you have a mirror?
It's the best way to see
if someone's still breathing.
The dog is dead, James.
Believe me,
I know a dead dog when I see one.
What are we supposed to do now?
First...
...you're gonna give me
that little cap gun of yours.
Come on.
Professor Tripp,
what are we gonna do with...
...it?
I don't know.
How do I tell the chancellor
that I murdered her husband's dog?
You?
When the family pet's
been assassinated...
...the owner doesn't want to hear
that a student was the triggerman.
Does she want to hear
it was a professor?
I've got tenure.
Hang on.
It's still warm.
Let's try feet first.
Yuck!
That is a big trunk.
It holds a tuba, a suitcase, a dead
dog and a garment bag perfectly.
Yeah, that's what
they used to say in the ads.
Crabtree, I know you're holding.
- Whose tuba is that, anyway?
- Miss Sloviak's.
- Can I ask you something about her?
- Yes, she is.
So your friend Crabtree, is he gay?
Most of the time he is.
Sometimes he isn't.
What do we have here?
This looks like....
It's our old friend, Mr. Codeine.
That should take the old pinch out
of the ankle. You want one?
No, thanks. I'm fine without them.
That's why you stood in
the chancellor's yard...
...spinning that cap gun of yours.
You're fine.
Yeah, you're as fit
as a fucking fiddle.
I'm sorry, James.
I'm sorry I said that.
How about we try that again?
<i>WALTER: It's a pleasure to
introduce best-selling author...</i>
<i>... Quentin Morewood,
known to his friends simply as Q.</i>
I...
...am a writer.
As a writer,
you learn that everyone has a story.
Every bartender,
every taxi driver has an idea...
...that would make a great book.
Presumably, each of you has an idea.
But how do you get from there to here?
What is the bridge from the water's
edge of inspiration...
...to the far shore of accomplishment?
Faith.
Faith that your story
is worth the telling.
Faith that you have
the wherewithal to tell it...
...and faith that the carefully woven
structure that you create...
...won't collapse beneath you.
Faith that when you get
to the other side...
...there'll be someone who gives a
damn about the tale you have to tell.
I'll be back in a minute.
I worship at the shrine
of formal construction....
Grady.
Grady.
You had another one again, didn't you?
Is the thing...
...is it over?
Almost.
Want to sit up?
What's wrong?
Nothing, I just twisted....
Sara, there's something
I've got to tell you.
Something hard.
Stand up. I'm too old
to roll around on the floor.
Give me a hand?
- Well, this evening--
- Don't.
- I know what you're gonna say.
- I don't think you do.
You love Emily. She's young,
she's beautiful, she's your wife.
You have to stay with her.
I don't have a choice.
Emily left me.
She'll come back.
That's why I'm going to...
...to not have this baby.
You're not gonna have it?
No, there's no way. I mean....
Don't you think there's no way?
Well, I don't see any....
- I know what it means to you.
- You don't!
Fuck you for saying you do
and for saying that there's no way!
Because there could be a way, Grady.
They're finishing. We should go.
Whose gun is that?
It's a souvenir from Baltimore.
It's heavy.
- Smells like gunpowder.
- Caps.
Pow.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
Oh.
The doors made so much noise.
It was so embarrassing.
They had to carry him out.
- He all right?
- He's fine. He's narrating.
They were going to the men's room.
But would they make it in time?
Terry Crabtree and James Leer.
Leave it to you to make that mistake.
Wait here.
- I need a ride.
- I'm your man.
There's an explanation.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe
at the poor thing?
- Antonia, listen--
- Tony. Now that I'm home.
Tony...
...I'm sorry tonight didn't work out
with Terry.
Forget it. Your friend is just....
I don't know,
into collecting weird tricks.
I think he'd call it a habit.
I do feel he's going
through the motions a bit.
You mean because
his career is ruined and all?
Is that what he told you?
He said he hasn't had a success
in over five years...
...and everyone in New York thinks
he's kind of a loser.
But he said
he's sure your book's so good...
...that he'll be able to keep his job.
You're not a writer
who has a success...
...then freezes up
and never has another.
You can turn here.
Gotta go. I think I may
have to rescue James Leer.
You know, Grady, maybe you should
think about going home.
You look like you need a little
rescuing yourself.
- Hey, Grady!
- How are you?
Can I get a double Dickel
on the rocks? I'm over here.
Double Dickel.
- Is that just beer?
- Primarily.
Although I gather you staged a raid
on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia.
Where is everybody?
Sara and Walter declined.
I guess they wanted to curl up
on the couch with Poe.
- Jesus, he's out!
- He has a book.
- I know, he started fall semester.
- He finished it winter break.
- So is he any good?
- No, not yet he isn't.
- I'm gonna read it anyway.
- Crabs, come on, will you?
He's one of my students,
for chrissakes!
Besides, I'm not sure if he's....
He is. I'm sure.
Take my word for it.
- I see myself in him.
- I'm sure you do.
It's more complicated than that.
He's scattered right now. He almost
did something stupid tonight.
He doesn't need sexual confusion
to mix things up.
I think it might be just the ticket.
Double Dickel on the rocks.
"Oola."
Thanks, Oola.
Cheers.
Oh, my goodness,
do you see what I see?
Right there. Let's go.
You first.
President of the James Brown
Hair Club for Men.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
No, a jockey. His name is Curtis.
- Curtis Hardapple.
- Not Curtis.
Okay, then, Vernon. Vernon Hardapple.
The scars are from a horse.
- He fell during a race.
- He's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing.
- Lives with his mother.
- He's got a younger brother...
- ...who's a--
- Who's a groom named Claudelle...
...and his mother blames Vernon
for Claudelle's death.
Because....
- Because....
- Because why?
- Because, um....
- Because....
He was killed when a gangster
named Freddy Nostrils...
...tried to shoot his favorite horse.
Claudelle took the bullet himself.
Vernon...
...over there...
...was in on the hit.
That was good.
Yeah, he heard everything we said.
Come on, teach.
I want you to dance with me.
- No.
- Come on!
<i>I've been re-reading
Arsonist's Daughter.</i>
It's so beautiful, Grady.
So natural.
Like your sentences always existed...
...waiting up there in Style Heaven
for you to fetch them down.
I thank you.
I love the inscription you wrote me.
Only I'm not quite
the downy innocent you think I am.
I hope that's not true.
We need all the downy innocents
we can get.
What this boy could use is
a nice tall Coca-Cola.
- Let me help.
- No, we got him.
- I'll meet you two at the car.
- Oh, I see. All right.
Give me the keys to the trunk.
I gotta get my property out.
The trunk's a little sticky.
I gotta do it.
Whatever...
...Professor Tripp.
When James gets back
to his apartment...
...make sure he's all right
before you leave.
I would if I knew
where I was taking him.
Are you telling me you don't know
where James lives?
Some apartment somewhere.
I've never seen it.
- That strikes me as very odd.
- Well, James is odd.
His aunt's in Sewickley Heights.
I dropped him there once.
It wasn't even his aunt's house.
He said she worked there.
I need my knapsack.
What's he saying?
His bag. That ugly green thing
he's always carrying around.
He must have left it inside.
Shit! He left it at Thaw,
the auditorium.
I need my knapsack!
- Let him crash at my house.
- Where do I put him?
You could stand him up in the
garage next to the snow shovels...
...and he'd be all right.
Grady, if you want to talk later,
I'll be up.
Tripp, the trunk. You're killing me.
- I'm gonna get it.
- Killing me!
You driving this car?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500.
You driving this car?
This is my car.
Bullshit! It's mine!
- You're mistaken.
- Bullshit!
- Who is that?
- Vernon, go home to your mother.
- What are you looking at?
- At you.
Hit it, will you?
Come on, killjoy, go.
Can we go now?
- What's with you?
- I wonder.
- The kid was comatose.
- Who started that?
- I was calming him down!
- You calmed him down, Dr. Feelgood.
- Grady, hit the brakes!
- What?
Stop the car! Hey!
Stop! What do you think--
- What's his problem?
- Back up!
Get out of the car! Hey!
Go around him.
I'm stopping you!
I don't think so!
Come back here!
- What's this?
- It's a one-way, guy.
Oh! Whoo!
Go, go, go! Whoo!
Look out. He's back.
- Now what?
- You owe him a book too?
You could always drive over him.
What the hell was that?
I just got my hood jumped on.
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Where would we go?
Hold on a second.
Professor Tripp.
I guess you're here for the backpack.
It's Traxler, Sam.
I saw the manuscript inside,
so when you showed up, I figured....
<i>GRADY:
The Love Parade. So it was true.</i>
<i>The prick had finished his book.</i>
- Is it good?
- I don't know. It might be.
<i>GRADY:
So there it was.</i>
<i>Somewhere in the night,
a Manhattan book editor...</i>
<i>... was prowling the streets
of Pittsburgh...</i>
<i>...best-selling author at his side...</i>
<i>...dead dog in his trunk.</i>
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that
stuff true about Errol Flynn?
How he used to put
paprika on his dick...
...to make it, you know, like...
...more stimulating for the chick?
Traxler, how the hell should I know?
You're reading his biography,
aren't you?
Oh, right.
No, it's true. He used to rub
all sorts of things on it.
Salad dressing, ground lamb.
Sick.
<i>GRADY: Whenever I wondered
what Sara saw in me...</i>
<i>...and I wondered more than once...</i>
<i>...I always came back to the fact
that she loved to read.</i>
<i>She read everything, every moment.
She was a junkie for the printed word.</i>
<i>And lucky for me...</i>
<i>...I manufactured her drug of choice.</i>
Is that your wife?
No, my wife's out of town.
What exactly are we doing here,
Professor Tripp?
Taking the long way home.
- Take it easy, Professor Tripp.
- Thanks for the ride.
<i>GRADY: I told myself I needed to put
everything aside for the moment...</i>
<i>...Emily, Sara, the purloined jacket
and the dead dog...</i>
<i>...and work on my book.</i>
<i>It had started out as a small book.</i>
<i>Probably about, oh, 250, 300 pages.</i>
<i>It had gotten a little larger
in scope.</i>
<i>And the ending kept getting
further away.</i>
<i>But the ending was there.
I knew it.</i>
<i>I could almost see it.</i>
James.
I'm okay.
I just lost my balance.
I put you on the floor.
Oh.
Thank you.
I thought you might swallow
your tongue.
- I guess you must really miss her.
- Hm?
Oh, this.
No, no, I just write in this.
This wasn't Emily's.
I guess there's probably a story
behind that.
There is, but it's not
very interesting.
Is all of that single-spaced?
I'm afraid so, yeah.
That's a really big book
you're writing.
Wow, Hannah always swore
you were working, but....
- But?
- Nothing.
<i>It's just been a while since
Arsonist's Daughter and some people...</i>
...some of the kids in workshop
thought maybe you were....
- Washed up?
- Blocked.
I don't believe in writer's block.
No kidding.
- You want me to get that?
- Please, could you?
Glasses.
Thank you.
Hello?
- He didn't give his name.
- Who?
- The guy on the phone.
- Well, what did he want?
He wanted to know
if a Grady Tripp lived here...
...and drove a maroon 1966 Ford
Galaxie 500 with black interior.
- What did you tell him?
- Yes.
Oh, good, James.
I just thought--
Good morning, boys.
- Good morning, James.
- Good morning.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Professor Tripp,
how did I get here last night?
No one knows where you live.
Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
And before that, did I do anything?
I mean, did I do anything bad?
Well, James, you did shoot the head
of the English department's dog...
...and steal his most prized piece
of memorabilia.
Oh, shit.
Do yourself a favor. Hide.
Hide?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Professor Tripp?
- That's right.
I understand you attended an event
at the Gaskell's house last night.
What's this all about anyway?
Someone broke into Dr. Gaskell's
closet. And the dog's missing.
I was wondering if you saw
someone who seemed suspicious.
I wouldn't say there was anybody
particularly suspicious.
How about this kid,
student of yours, Leer? James Leer?
Would you know how I could
get in touch with him?
I think I have his number on campus.
That's all right. We'll find him.
- Morning.
- You have a good one.
There you are. I thought
we were going to talk last night.
- I was--
- Professor Tripp?
I heard what he said.
- What time's breakfast?
- What do we do now?
Just one minute. Hello?
<i>SARA: Grady?
- Sara.</i>
<i>Thank God you're there.
You won't believe what happened.</i>
Could you hold on
just a minute, honey?
- May I ask you something?
- Sure, James.
Where exactly are we going?
There's a few things
I gotta do today.
- See my wife--
- The one that left you?
That's the one.
- Ow! Oh, shit!
- Oh.
Son of a bitch!
You're bleeding, Professor Tripp.
No shit, James.
So where exactly do you live, James?
Apparently, not even Hannah Green
has a clue...
...as to the location
of your apartment.
I got kicked out.
Well, not exactly kicked out.
I was asked to leave.
There's probably a story there.
There is, but it's not
very interesting.
So where are you staying?
At the....
The, uh, bus station.
It's not so bad.
I know the night janitor...
...and there's a locker
I can put my stuff.
Jesus, James.
I mean, for how long?
A couple of weeks. That's why....
That's why I have the gun,
for protection.
- You should've told someone.
- Who?
I don't know. Me?
<i>GRADY: James ' story was the stuff
of bad fiction.</i>
<i>Under other circumstances,
I might've wondered...</i>
<i>... where the page ended with him
and real life began.</i>
<i>But I had other things on my mind.</i>
<i>The Gaskell house looked deserted,
which figured, since...</i>
<i>- ... Wordfest was in full swing.
- What are we...?</i>
Ease off on that stuff.
It's pretty acidic.
I can't help it.
I don't know what's the matter.
You're hung-over. What do you
think's the matter with you?
I'll be right back.
<i>I knew I needed to have
a heart- to-heart with Sara.</i>
<i>But until then, I'd just make
a little gesture.</i>
Feeling guilty?
I can't believe you hung up on me,
you dick.
Sara, I'm so sorry about this morning.
There was a lot going on.
Walter's a basket case.
Someone stole Marilyn's jacket
last night. And Poe's missing.
- I heard.
- You heard? How?
A 12-year-old policeman came by
my house this morning.
Did you confess? Your fingerprints
were all over the bedroom.
Really? That was fast.
I'm joking. Hello!
Right, right, right.
Look, about last night, there's
something I have to talk to you about.
Okay.
Uh, I....
I, um....
I want to be with you.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.
No, really, Sara, I do. Honest.
No, I believe you want to be with me,
but it's just not good enough.
I know what's at stake.
No, I don't think you do.
It doesn't matter.
I haven't decided yet.
About the baby.
That, and you.
I'm not gonna draw you a map.
Times like these, you have to do
your own navigating.
Why is your car over there?
And who's that sitting in it?
James Leer.
What's he doing here?
I'm sort of helping him through
some issues.
Isn't he lucky?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Yeah, well, the moment didn't
actually present itself.
You feel like taking a ride?
Yes.
Humboldt County?
Maybe.
My father, he gets it from his doctor.
- Glaucoma?
- Colon cancer.
- Jesus. James, wow.
- It's a bit of a scandal.
My parents live in a small town.
- Where's that?
- Carvel.
- Carvel? Where's Carvel?
- Outside Scranton.
I've never heard of it.
It's a hellhole.
Three motels and a mannequin factory.
My dad worked there for 35 years.
Your father worked
in a mannequin factory?
Seitz Plastics.
That's where he met my mom.
She was a fry cook in the cafeteria.
Before that, she'd been a dancer.
What kind of dancer?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Didn't you say that your mom
went to Catholic school?
When we fall, we fall hard.
I thought you didn't like to
lose control of your emotions.
Maybe I just needed the moment
to present itself.
Mmm.
<i>I'd come to the childhood home of my
soon- to-be ex-wife...</i>
<i>... to set things straight.</i>
<i>To say something to end things
on the right note.</i>
<i>To make Emily feel
better about it all...</i>
<i>...or maybe to make me feel better.</i>
<i>Truthfully, I wasn't really sure
why I was there.</i>
Someone jumped on your car
with their butt.
How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.
You want one? They're incredible.
Incredible!
Smoke the rest of that joint,
you can start chewing on the box.
- Maybe she didn't come here.
- She came here.
We'll just wait.
In the meantime, I'm gonna need you
to shimmy right through there.
Relax, Emily hasn't used her keys
since she was 15 years old.
Your hips aren't
much bigger than hers.
It's not that. It just reminded me
of what's in the car.
In the trunk?
Oh, right, right.
Let's try not to think about that.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.
It feels really good in here.
Yeah, I know.
It's the kind of house you'd like to
wake up in on Christmas morning.
I'll be right back.
Make yourself at home.
I'm gonna make a phone call.
Ah.
Mmm.
<i>There's no such thing
as a good influence.</i>
<i>- All influence is immoral.
- Why?</i>
<i>The aim of life is self-development,
to realize one's nature perfectly.</i>
<i>That's what we're here for.</i>
<i>A man should live out
his life fully.</i>
<i>Give form to every feeling
and reality to every dream.</i>
<i>GRADY: Sitting there among her things,
I was reminded...</i>
<i>...I didn 't really know Emily at all.</i>
<i>Though we'd lived together as man and
wife, it was when I left the house...</i>
<i>... when I was with Sara
that I felt like I was home.</i>
<i>WOMAN: University.
- Chancellor, please.</i>
<i>There's only one way to
get rid of a temptation: Yield to it.</i>
<i>Resist it...</i>
<i>...and the soul longs for
what it's forbidden to itself.</i>
Thank you.
Ah.
<i>SARA: Hello?
- Sara? Hi, it's Grady.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>
Kinship. There's something
I gotta talk to you about.
<i>- You're in Kinship?
- That's not why I'm calling.</i>
<i>- You're with Emily.
- What?</i>
No, there's no one here.
I'm just....
<i>Doing a little dusting?</i>
<i>JUDY GARLAND ON TV: Good morning
We've danced the whole night through</i>
<i>Good morning, good morning...</i>
<i>... to you</i>
<i>JAMES: Good morning, good morning</i>
<i>Good morning</i>
Sara, I'm not here...
...to reconcile with Emily.
<i>It doesn 't matter.</i>
<i>How you live your own life
is your business.</i>
Sara, you don't understand.
<i>SARA: Probably not,
but I have something to say.</i>
<i>And I want you to listen
carefully, Grady.</i>
Yes.
<i>I can't wait for you,
because if I do...</i>
<i>...I could end up
waiting forever...</i>
<i>...so I'm going to make
this decision on my own.</i>
<i>Goodbye, Grady.</i>
<i>Making a comeback.</i>
<i>Gee, it must be terrible
to be a has-been.</i>
Hello.
Hi.
Oh.
I can clean it up, but you need to see
someone who knows what he's doing.
How would you like some hot chocolate
and fresh cookies to go with it?
- Sounds nice. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
This is really good hot chocolate.
He's one of your students, this boy?
Yeah, he's a good kid.
He's just a little messed up.
Then I'm sure he'll be fine,
with the proper guidance.
So where's Emily, Hank?
I don't know if I should
tell you that, Grady.
I don't want to stalk her.
I want to tell her that I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to get her back.
Things haven't been right with us
for a while.
Well, all I know is,
Emily felt you weren't there for her.
That she's felt that
for a long time, Grady.
Right now she's in Philadelphia
visiting Linda Ashby.
For chrissakes,
they went to Wellesley together.
- Linda spent a week at your house.
- Oh, Linda. Oh.
I haven't been sleeping a lot lately.
I got my editor in town.
Trying to finish my book.
Right. The book.
I hope it's really good, Grady.
I'm having a really good time,
Professor Tripp.
I'm really happy for you, James.
Do me a favor, lay off my dope.
That stuff's not for amateurs.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
You're mad because I shot
your girlfriend's dog.
It wasn't her dog,
it was her husband's.
Who said anything about a girlfriend?
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot
my girlfriend's dog.
Even though Poe and I were not
what you'd call simpatico...
...that's no reason he should've
taken two in the chest.
I don't know.
You just keep acting like
a goddamn spook all the time, James.
I guess that explains why
all the kids in workshop hate me.
All the kids in workshop
hate you because right now...
...you're ten times the writer
any one of them will ever be.
My stuff stinks. You said so yourself
last night to your friend Crabtree.
I didn't mean it like that.
What does it matter what I think?
What does it matter what anybody
thinks? Most people don't think.
And if they do,
it's not about writing.
Books, they don't mean anything.
Not to anybody.
Not anymore.
<i>Arsonist's Daughter meant something.</i>
It meant something to me.
It's the reason I came to school here,
to be taught by you.
It's one of the reasons
I wanted to become a writer.
Well, for that, James,
if nothing else...
...I'm really sorry.
What are we doing?
I'll get you a nice meal, couple
of cups of coffee, and take you home.
- Take me now.
- What?
- I'm not hungry.
- You've gotta eat.
I'll get something
from the vending machine.
What are you talking about?
At the bus station, they have cheese
sandwiches. They're pretty good.
Take me now,
that way Carl won't get my spot.
Carl?
- Never mind.
- James, go get us a table, will you?
I won't let the most talented
writer in my class...
...eat some week-old cheese sandwich.
I won't let him sleep
in some bus station.
So go on inside.
I'll be there in a minute.
<i>GRADY: C-A-R-V-E-L.</i>
Yes, I'm sure, ma'am.
It's outside of Scranton.
You have no listing.
Okay, well....
Lady, as we speak, I am looking at
a resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania.
I'm sure he'd be
interested to learn...
...that the people at Bell Atlantic
misplaced his entire hometown.
It's not like I'm making this up
as we go--
Never mind. My mistake.
- You want a bite?
- No, thanks.
That's why you're having them,
your spells.
Spells?
We're not in a Tennessee Williams
play. I don't get spells.
What would you call them?
I don't know....
Episodes.
I just worry about you, that's all.
You just worry about yourself, okay?
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Just stay here and eat.
I'll be right back.
- Good evening.
- Professor Tripp.
- Grady.
- Fred Leer. This is my wife, Amanda.
Looks like I dashed
a wonderful evening.
We were on our way to a benefit...
...but the club was on the way,
so we put in an appearance.
I thought it'd be good for James
to be with his family this weekend.
Oh, well, of course
we can understand that.
Right.
Okay, I guess I'll go get James.
Um, I hope you don't find
this forward, Amanda, but...
...did you ever go to Catholic school?
Excuse me?
I'm not going with them.
- Things are a little weird for me now.
- Things are a little weird for me too.
I got my editor in town,
I gotta finish my book--
I won't bother you.
Like it or not, those people
out there are your parents.
- They're not my parents.
- What?
They're my grandparents.
My parents are dead.
The man is obviously your father.
You look just like him.
There's a reason for that.
Get out of here.
That's why she makes me sleep
in the basement.
In the crawlspace with the rats
and the cask of Amontillado.
They treat me like a freak!
You are a freak, James.
Welcome to the club.
You don't know what it's like.
You're right, I don't.
I won't feel sorry for you,
because I don't know who you are.
Let me ask you something, James.
In the past 36 hours...
...have you told me anything true?
One thing that comes from you?
I just wanted to stay with you
for a little while. That's all.
I'm a teacher, James.
I'm not a Holiday Inn.
Thank you, professor.
Hey!
Hey.
Crabtree. Jesus!
Do you mind?
- Grady.
- Hey.
Uh.
I know I shouldn't have, but it was
out in the open and I couldn't resist.
I just can't believe
that I left it out like this.
- Tripp! Where are you?
- Has Crabtree been snooping around?
I don't know. I don't think so.
Let's put this away.
Tripp!
Oh, shit.
Don't go. I've been waiting
all night for you.
I'm really flattered,
but this isn't--
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting
a teacher-student conference?
You're not the most attentive host.
You've been taking good care of that.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Where the hell have you been, anyway?
I took a drive with James Leer.
- He popped the chancellor's dog.
- What?
The police thought he ran away, but
Dr. Gaskell found blood on the carpet.
Oh, Jesus.
They thought it was an intruder, but
Terry said James was messed up in it.
Has anybody else come up with
this brilliant deduction?
Not yet. It's just a matter of time.
You don't even know James.
Who does?
I do. I do now.
I spent some time with him,
and I read something of his.
You read his book?
- Yes.
- Is it good?
It's good. It's very, very good.
It's true.
I knew it. So where is he now?
- I sent him home with his parents.
- What?!
What? His parents?
Why did you do that?
Under the circumstances, I thought
it was the best thing for him.
I'm beginning to think it was
the best thing for me.
I just wasn't there for him.
Imagine that.
Hannah, do you remember where you took
James that day? Was it his aunt's?
- Yes.
- I told you, Sewickley Heights.
What was the address?
He had me drop him on a corner.
- Call the university.
- A little late to call admissions.
Is it a little late to call
the chancellor?
I don't know. Maybe.
You really have just made an awful,
stinky little mess of everything.
Is that it?
Do not even think about it.
Don't go near.
- Never without your permission, but--
- 262 Baxter Drive.
They're in the book.
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive.
<i>The Love Parade. I got a feeling
about this. I feel him in my bones.</i>
Only in your bones?
I've had this feeling before.
Remember?
It's been a long time, but....
How bad is it for you, Crabs?
It's pretty bad.
Bad enough that they look at me
like I don't work there anymore.
I guess I just don't fit
the new corporate profile.
Which is?
Gosh. Competence.
This is it.
<i>GRADY: I had no business trudging to
James Leer's parents ' house at night.</i>
<i>Not when all that mattered was
making things right with Sara.</i>
<i>But we had decided
to rescue James Leer.</i>
<i>I wasn't sure from what,
because I was convinced...</i>
<i>... that everything that came
out of James ' mouth was horseshit.</i>
Yikes!
There must be two dozen windows.
How we supposed to find his?
I told you, they keep him chained
in the basement.
<i>But maybe that didn't matter.</i>
<i>Sometimes people just
need to be rescued.</i>
- Rodgers and Hart?
- Yeah.
James Leer.
What are you guys doing here?
We're springing you.
Put on some clothes.
I love what you've done to the place.
When's Captain Nemo moving in?
I cannot believe
that you made fun of my bathrobe.
Candelabras are my great-grandma's.
Don't start with the family history.
I'll leave you here.
I heard about your parents, your
grandparents and the Chinatown thing.
I believe you. That's why we're here.
Get dressed.
Do you mind if I wear this again?
Wear whatever you want to.
- He's so modest.
- He's so sensitive.
Why don't you cut the kid some slack?
These are all overdue library books.
It looks like our Mr. Leer is facing
some monster late fees.
Can't believe the shit he spins.
Just once, I'd like to know
the bastard's telling the truth.
Hey.
Check this out.
"The door opened.
It was a shock to see him...
...shuffling into the room like an
aging prizefighter, limping, beaten."
Does that sound like anyone we know?
"It was later, when the man squinted
into the bitter glow of twilight..."
Kid definitely needs an editor.
"...and muttered simply:
'It means nothing.
All of it, nothing' ...
...that the true shock came.
Then the boy understood...
...that his hero's true injuries
lay in a darker place.
His heart..."
His heart what?
"His heart, once capable
of inspiring others...
...could no longer inspire
so much as itself.
It beat now only out of habit.
It beat now only...
...because it could."
I'm ready.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
He's fine. Can we go, before
Granny comes and boils your bones?
That could be a problem. She comes
down every half-hour to check on me.
If I'm not here,
she might call the police.
Okay, decoy. We'll put pillows
under the spread. She'll never know.
<i>Like in Against All Flags.
They used huge hams.</i>
No, I got a better idea.
Good night, sweet prince.
Let's go upstairs.
There's bad vibes down here.
Things must've picked up
after we left, huh, Grady?
Good night, bro.
<i>You've reached
Sara and Walter Gaskell.</i>
<i>Neither Walter or I can take your--</i>
<i>WALTER: Hello?
- Walter?</i>
<i>Grady? Oh, Christ, Grady,
do you know what time it is?</i>
Yeah. I got 8: 15.
<i>- I don't think that's right.
- It's 3:30, Grady.</i>
<i>- Well, this is important, Walter.
- Oh?</i>
I....
<i>What is it, Grady?</i>
I'm in love with your wife.
<i>Excuse me?</i>
Sara. I'm in love with her.
<i>Are you drinking right now?</i>
No.
<i>Nevertheless, I'd like to see you
in my office...</i>
<i>...Monday morning.</i>
Oh, boy.
- Sara, what...?
- I tried to call, but...
...it seems there's something wrong...
...with your phone.
It appears one of our students
is missing.
And his parents found a dead dog
in his bed.
It's my fault.
I've been trying to tell you--
I'm not feeling very happy with you
right now.
And Walter isn't very happy.
He's gotten the police involved.
They seem to think James Leer
is responsible for all this.
You wouldn't know
where James Leer is...
...would you?
He's inside.
And Marilyn's jacket?
Oh, it's in my car--
- Somebody stole my car!
- Oh, man!
Honestly! I parked it right there
last night!
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure!
Here comes the puberty police now.
Okay, okay, I'll deal with this.
You go dig up James.
Is he awake?
A police officer's on the porch.
He's not going away.
- That same guy?
- Same one.
No offense, Professor Tripp,
but you look sort of crappy.
You do look horrible.
It's the chancellor.
- We're fine, just fine.
- Fine. Right.
Fit as a fucking fiddle.
James, come on.
James, this book of yours....
It's...
...not bad. Not bad at all.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm gonna publish this.
I think with the proper
editorial guidance...
...this could be brilliant.
Oh, that's great.
Between Officer Pupcik and you,
he can be the next Jean Genet.
Long time since somebody wrote
a good book in jail.
Don't worry.
We're gonna figure something out.
I'm not worried.
You're not worried, are you?
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't be.
I don't care if they expel me.
I probably should be expelled.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
- Professor Tripp?
- Yes, James.
Even if I end up going to jail...
...you're still the best teacher
I ever had.
I wonder if this is what
the university has in mind...
...when it promises
a liberal education.
- Would Walter really press charges?
- We'll know soon enough.
In a few hours, he'll sit down
with the police and James' parents...
...and he was a wee bit prickly
this morning.
You didn't happen to call our house
last night, did you?
I think I might have, yes.
What do you think you said?
I think I might have said
I was in love with you.
He told you?
He told me.
And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Hey, Tripp?
What do we do now?
Find the jacket.
- How do we do that?
- I've got an idea where it is.
We could ask Hannah for her car.
Sure. Keys are on the desk.
Next to your book.
I didn't finish. I fell asleep.
It's that good, huh?
It's not that. It's just--
It's just...
...what?
You know how you always tell us
that writers make choices?
Yeah.
And even though your book is
amazingly beautiful, it's...
...it's at times, it's...
...very detailed.
You know, with the genealogies of
everyone's horses...
...and the dental records and so on.
And I could be wrong, but it just
sort of reads in places like...
...you really didn't make any choices.
At all.
I was just wondering
if it might not be different...
...if when you wrote,
you weren't always...
...under the influence.
Well.
Well, thank you for the thought.
But shocking as it may sound...
...I am not the first writer
to sip a little weed.
And it might surprise you that one
book I wrote "under the influence" ...
...happened to win something
called the PEN Award.
Which, by the way, I accepted
"under the influence."
Hey! Let me help you with that.
- Don't touch it.
- Okay.
I'll drive.
Jerry Nathan owes you money,
so as collateral he gives you his car?
Only I'm beginning to think
that the car wasn't Jerry's.
Ah, so whose car was it?
My guess: Vernon Hardapple.
The hood-jumper?
He said a few things
that lead me to believe it was his.
Such as?
"That's my car, motherfucker."
So we find Vernon...
- ...we find the car. We find the car--
- We find the jacket.
Wow!
Christ!
How did you know?
Oh, I don't know.
- Call it a hunch.
- Call it genius.
Good to know I'm still talented
at something.
Careful.
Keep that motor running.
I know you.
"Double Dickel on the rocks."
Oola.
I never forget a drink.
I never forget an Oola.
Forget me?
- Vernon?
- Go inside, cupcake! He's got a gun!
- Who's got a gun?
- You! Drop it!
Uh-oh.
- Vernon, relax.
- Why'd he call you Vernon?
Why is he in my car?
He's crazy, that's why!
He probably calls everybody Vernon!
- Drop that gun!
- Oh, dear.
- It's a souvenir.
- It's a souvenir.
Bullshit! I know a gun
when I see one, and that's a gun!
No, really.
- Oh, God! Oh!
- Give me that gun!
Are you crazy?
Can't you see the condition
my girl's in? Get out! Get out!
Hey!
Stop!
Cupcake, you okay?
Tripp, run!
Who in the hell is that?
Oh, shit.
- No, you don't!
- No!
- Don't shoot!
- Oh, no, don't!
Come on, Tripp! Jump in!
Oh, God!
He's a crazy man.
Oh, my God!
I take it back.
Shoot him.
Naturally, you have copies.
I have an alternate version
of the first chapter.
You'll be all right then. Look at
Carlyle when he lost his luggage.
- That was Macaulay.
- Oh.
What about Hemingway,
when Hadley lost those stories?
He was never able to reproduce them.
Look, I don't want to depreciate
the loss here...
...but maybe, in a sense,
it's for the best.
You suggesting it's some kind of sign?
- In a sense.
- In my experience...
...signs are a little more subtle.
Let me get this straight.
All that paper that blew away...
...that was the only copy?
I'm afraid so, yes.
And you, you're saying
that it's some kind of a sign?
What the fuck's the matter with you?
Don't.
All I'm saying is that sometimes,
subconsciously...
...a person will put themselves in
a situation, perhaps even create it...
...to have an arena in which
to work out an unresolved issue.
It's a covert way
of addressing a problem.
I'll tell you the problem.
You behind the wheel,
there's your problem.
Did you or did you not
have a gun to his head?
He was trying to steal my car.
Didn't you have a gun to his head?!
All right, all right!
That's enough! What is done is done!
I don't want to hear
about it anymore, okay?!
So, what was it about?
Your book.
What was the story?
I don't know.
He means it's hard to distill a book's
essence because it lives in the mind.
But you gotta know what it was about.
If you didn't know what it was about,
why were you writing it?
I couldn't stop.
Vernon, can I ask you a question?
Boy or girl?
As long as it looks like her...
...I really don't care.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
- Thanks for the ride, Vernon.
- Anytime.
- And another thing.
- Yeah?
- Stop calling me Vernon.
- Okay.
Jacket, Tripp.
- What?
- We need the jacket.
Oh, right.
- Oola, about that jacket?
- Yeah.
It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe.
Really?
She had small shoulders...
...just like you.
A lot of people don't know that.
Thank you.
Man, that book of yours must've been
one nutty ride.
Come on, baby, let's go.
Explain to me what you just did.
Came to my senses.
Congratulations.
And what's James supposed to do?
Pray Walter Gaskell comes to his?
Walter Gaskell doesn't want
to send James Leer to jail.
He's up in his office right now.
He's talking to his parents.
Local police are trying to find
a solution.
Tripp, the least they're gonna do
is expel him.
It doesn't matter.
That's very enlightened.
Comforting to know America's children
have you for a teacher.
Nobody teaches a writer anything.
You tell them what you know.
Tell them to find their voice. Tell
those that have it to keep at it...
...tell the same to those that don't.
That's the way they'll get
to where they're going.
Of course, it does help if you know
where you want to go.
Helping my students figure that out....
That and Sara.
That's what's made these last years
worthwhile.
As for James...
...well, he doesn't really
need me anymore. He's got you.
Me?
- What can I do?
- Oh, I don't know, Crabs.
Improvise.
You're pretty good at that.
Tripp?
I'm sorry.
Improvise.
<i>GRADY:
As for me, I was through improvising.</i>
<i>I knew what I had to do.
I had to find Sara.</i>
<i>I had to convince her
that she was my choice.</i>
<i>That she had been
from the very beginning.</i>
And now...
...as those who've been with us
in previous years know...
...we have a tradition of sorts
at Wordfest.
I'm speaking, of course,
of "the plums."
- Those lucky local writers
who have successfully placed...
...their manuscripts with visiting
publishers' representatives.
This weekend, Susan Lowery...
...of North Braddock found a publisher
for her children's book...
<i>... The Loneliest Prawn.</i>
Stand up, Susan.
Now, this next one...
...is, I think,
very exciting to announce...
...because it concerns a student
here at the university.
Our own James Leer...
...sophomore in English literature...
...has found a publisher
for his first novel...
...which I believe is called:
<i>The Lovely Parade.</i>
<i>Love Parade.</i>
<i>- Love Parade.
- James.</i>
Stand up.
Go on.
He's a real alien probe,
if you know what I mean.
Take a bow, James!
Wonder boy.
And finally, and perhaps
not least importantly...
...Terry Crabtree of Bartizan has
also decided to publish my own book...
...a critical exploration
of the union of Joe DiMaggio...
...and Marilyn Monroe, and its
function in American mythopoetics.
Which, tentatively,
I have entitled:
<i>The Last American Marriage.</i>
So until next year...
...thank you, everyone.
<i>I took another look at
The Arsonist's Daughter.</i>
That description of the bald cypress
left me breathless.
Thanks, Q. I appreciate that.
Sara!
Yo, Traxler.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
You get high, Sam?
Only when I'm working.
Holy shit!
Are you serious?
Careful there!
Whoa.
<i>I didn't fall.</i>
<i>Not then. Not ever again.</i>
<i>Once the Monongahela River
swallowed my never-ending opus...</i>
<i>... there were no more "spells. "</i>
<i>James Leer didn't get expelled
or go to jail, thanks to Crabtree.</i>
<i>But he quit anyway.</i>
<i>Went to New York to rework his
novel for publication.</i>
<i>Hannah Green has decided to take
a position as a junior editor...</i>
<i>... when she graduates.</i>
<i>And Crabtree, well, Crabtree's gone
right on being Crabtree.</i>
<i>As for me...</i>
<i>...I lost everything.</i>
<i>My wife, my book, my job.</i>
<i>Everything that I thought
was important.</i>
<i>But I finally knew
where I wanted to go.</i>
<i>And now I had someone
to help me get there.</i>
