I... I think that there's
 something wrong with me.
For some reason I find that the
 girls that I like as human-beings
I am not sexually attracted to and
the ones that I am sexually attracted to
I don't particularly like as human-beings.
And on the rare occasion,
 one falls in both categories,
they usually have a boyfriend or a husband.
And lord knows, I've got enough
 of that bad karma to last me a lifetime.
These are classic Freudian symptoms, Conrad.
Haven't you ever read about
 defense mechanisms?
Actually I've always considered
 myself more of a Jungian.
LOVE TO GO
 The longest week of my life.
The phone's ringing again!
Stop talking.
You stop talking.
Alright.
Morning.
Afternoon.
Yes, it's Conrad Valmont.
What?
But I've lived here since birth.
<i>This is Conrad Valmont.</i>
<i>Conrad was the son of a Parisian entrepreneur
 and a Caledonian debutante.</i>
<i>His father, Jean-Louis Valmont,</i>
<i>owned the Valmont Hotel.</i>
<i>As had his father and
 this father before him.</i>
<i>Their country home in Great Neck was
 the Pantheon of summer gatherings.</i>
<i>On the eve of his 51st year...</i>
<i>... Jean-Louis took Conrad's mother
 to the south of France.</i>
<i>On what was to be a weekend excursion.</i>
<i>And it since turned into a lavish
 excapade around the world.</i>
<i>Lasting nearly 3 decades.</i>
<i>Over the subsequent years,
 Conrad was raised by the Valmont staff.</i>
<i>His chauffeur, Bernard,</i>
<i>had taken Conrad to a Parisian brothel
 for this 13th birthday...</i>
<i>... as a sort of, rite of passage
 into polite society.</i>
<i>It was a family tradition.</i>
<i>At present, he was working
 on his Magnum Opus.</i>
<i>A great New York novel
 in the tradition of Fitzgerald.</i>
<i>Edith Wharton.</i>
<i>It was wildly speculated as to where he was
 in the process of writing it.</i>
<i>When asked, he would simply reply...</i>
...I'm in the gathering stages.
<i>Conrad had been in the "gathering stages"...</i>
<i>... for several years now.</i>
<i>Last week, Thursday,</i>
<i>Conrad's parents had capsized
 and had become stranded</i>
<i>on a small island in the Mediterranean.</i>
<i>Having to spend numerous days together</i>
<i>and without the distractions of wealth
 and a transient lifestyle,</i>
<i>they had come to a simple realization...</i>
<i>... they didn't particularly like one another.</i>
<i>Conrad's parents were
 to divorce by the weeks end.</i>
<i>And neither wanted to continue
 paying for Conrad's extravagant lifestyle.</i>
<i>Hence...</i>
<i>... the Valmont bored of trusties
 have requested hotel security</i>
<i>to escort Conrad from the premises by 2 pm.</i>
Bunny, please make yourself useful.
 Get some more cigarettes, please.
- Hey!
 - What?
I'm hungry.
I'll be right there!
Well, I.. I don't understand.
What do you mean
 "they won't except the charges"?
Did you tell them it was Conrad Valmont?
Hello?!
- What are you smiling at?
 - Eh, nothing.
Come on, Bunny.
Bernard, please take us to the Bellville Caf√©.
Eh, I'm, I'm... I'm sorry, I...
... I can't.
Hey, it's me.
 I'm gonna have this sorted out in no time.
I can't.
 I mean it's... orders from the boss.
I'm sorry, Conny.
Can you do me a favor?
- Name it.
 - Can you take care of Napoleon while I'm gone?
Of course.
This is lame!
I'm gonna go.
No, Bunny!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Listen.
Can I borrow some cash for a cab?
No?
I'll be in touch.
<i>Conrad chose to ride the subway.</i>
<i>A convention he rarely took up</i>
<i>since he had learned
 how to hail a cab at the age of 7.</i>
<i>But it was on this rare occasion
 that he first saw Beatrice.</i>
<i>Her unassuming beauty,
 struck him at once.</i>
<i>And as his eyes gazed down he couldn't help but</i>
<i>notice she was reading 'Sense and Sensibility'.</i>
<i>Immediately, Conrad reasoned,
 she could be no older than 19.</i>
<i>And would easily be molded
 into a girl of his liking.</i>
<i>Of course there was always
 the outside chance that</i>
<i>she was merely a Jane Austin fan.</i>
<i>But Conrad quickly ruled that out on a hunch.</i>
<i>Here in lies the eternal question.</i>
<i>Is it a grocery list?</i>
<i>Or her phone number?</i>
<i>It was at that moment Conrad realized...</i>
<i>... he was going to see her naked.</i>
I think I'm in love.
Conrad...
You've only just met her.
I know.
Is she attractive?
Yes.
You know, you have an unhealthy obsession
 with female beauty.
I don't care.
Maybe you should try dating
 more homely women?
I don't think so.
Take it from me...
Someone who's been married
 for 25 years, Conrad.
Inner beauty, doesn't age.
You're just saying that because
 your wife is unattractive.
- Conrad.
 - Yes?
What are you going to do?
You have no home.
Move in with Dylan, of course.
How about money?
I need some, thank you.
 Yes.
Conrad...
... I'm not your accountant.
I'm your analyst.
Well, I'm surly not going to travel downtown and
 work for 10 hours a day.
For the best 20 years of my life, doing some dull,
 unimaginative work, certainly...
... non-altruistic work.
No thanks.
Conrad...
There's an interesting case study a colleague
 of mine did a few years back.
The subject was a young German woman
 who'd been diagnosed with a brain tumor.
It rendered her witty
charming
and quite likable to most.
You trying to set me up?
Though she possessed all the
 aforementioned attributes
her life was actually completely artificial.
She had no meaning.
No emotion.
Not a care in the world.
She seemed utterly blissful to an outsider but
 her family and friends were worried.
Even horrified.
German neurologists called it 'Witzelsucht'.
The joking disease.
But, eventually...
... a dissolution set in and...
... her life was left empty.
You're saying that I have a brain tumor?
<i>Conrad's analyst had given
 Conrad a low-interest loan</i>
<i>in the amount of 217 dollars and 33 cents.</i>
<i>The entirety of his wallets remains.</i>
<i>Conrad's ego was in no position
 to admit the reality of his impoverishment.</i>
<i>Consequently, he had decided not tell Dylan...</i>
Ding-Dong.
<i>... or anyone for that matter of his financial woes.</i>
Bonjour comrade.
Bon-jour.
<i>This is Dylan Tate.</i>
<i>Dylan was an anti-social socialist.</i>
<i>A closet conversationalist.</i>
<i>A clinical neuritic.</i>
<i>Possessing an inimitable talent for the arts.</i>
<i>Dylan had been afforded the opportunity to</i>
<i>travel the world and live
 a comfortable lifestyle at his own expense.</i>
<i>Something Conrad new nothing about.</i>
<i>Dylan Tate was the only personage of all Conrad's</i>
<i>quintessences whom he'd admired.</i>
<i>And... to a bigger extent than
 he'd liked to admit to himself.</i>
Envy.
How was Greece?
You mean Bhutan.
Semantics.
I got back a couple of days ago.
Mm-hmm.
Do you mind if I stay with you for a while?
Sure, come on in.
So... what happened?
We are remodeling at the Valmont again.
Where's Jocelyn?
I don't know.
Uh...
It's been a couple of weeks.
What I first perceived as cute and
 endearing was actually, quite...
... exhausting.
Her episodic hysteria, her chronic dissatisfaction,
 her endless pragmatism.
You know you two always do this, right?
One of you screams,
 the other one comes running back.
Yeah, I.. I bought her a Volvo.
You bought her a... why...
 why do you always buy them a Volvo?
I don't know.
 It's like a...
... free ticket to leave.
How can I feel guilty?
You know?
I bought her a Volvo.
You know what really
 pisses me off about this whole thing?
Is that I am the one who funded
 her entire Vegan Fashion line.
And now that every socialite in St. Bart thinks
 it's fashionable I get the swift kick.
Swift kick?
 I thought you broke it off with her.
I did but still...
So...
Henri? Over at the gallery?
Set me up on a date last week.
That bad, huh?
You can always tell what somebody thinks
 of you by who they set you up with.
Is it wrong to be aroused by
 a bunch of 17-year old girls
running around with knee-high socks
 and polyester shorts?
Well, I guess that's a decision
 every man has to make for himself.
But yes, obviously, yes.
Conrad needs a girlfriend.
No,no,no.
 We don't need girlfriends.
This is not the time for girlfriends.
This is a time for us to read and
 to write and to have
deviant fetishistic sex with prostitutes.
Please, this from a serial monogamist.
You've never even been with a prostitute.
I understand that, if you'll indulge me.
I'm going through a rough break-up.
 I need to have certain...
... reassurances about
 the prospect of bachelorhood.
Look alive. Look alive.
You need a new goalie?!
Don't make eye contact.
Hey, mister, give us back our ball!
Interactions are inappropriate.
I can play.
We should move.
Like little veal.
So, I met a woman a couple of weeks ago.
I don't know.
 I cant get her out of my head.
What happened to the
 prospects of bachelorhood?
I know, I just find it completely...
... overwhelmingly tedious and unnerving.
So...
Tell me about the girl.
 What are the details.
Well, she's like an ingenue
 in a Chekhov play.
You know, one of those
 overly romantic virtuous types.
Completely self-inhibited.
 Doesn't drink.
Didn't have sex until she was 21.
- Got the bulk of a Victorian classics.
 - Jesus.
- Sounds like a real keeper.
 - Oh, she is. She really is.
I'm, I'm way over my head.
Is she attractive?
Um, she's a model.
If I ever...
... lost my fortune and
 was completely disinherited...
... could you ever see me as a...
 as a struggling bohemian artist type?
Hypothetically speaking of course?
That reminds me.
 Do you want to come with me to the, ah...
... cocktail benefit at the
 Woodrow Modern tonight?
No.
- Come on.
  - You know, I don't like those things.
- I'll be fun, you can, uh...
 - Probably not.
Then you can, uh... meet the ingenue?
Is it a date?
Not exactly. We do this thing
 where we don't really go out together.
We just call each other to make sure
 the other is going to be at a certain place.
To appear at any time...
We just happen to, uh...
... bump into one another.
 It's less pressure.
So you want to come to the cocktail party?
Well...
I need a cocktail first.
Are you wearing perfume?
No, it's a new cologne that
 I'm wearing for my date.
Why? What do you think?
Well, I think it smells like perfume.
No, the woman at Bergdorf's
 told me that it's unisex.
And you wanted to smell sexually ambiguous?
Good evening.
And welcome to this evenings benefit.
<i>I must say I'm more than thrilled
 to see so many familiar faces.</i>
Enjoy the complementary hors d'oeuvres and
champagne.
And remember...
champagne.
And remember...
... make a donation!
<i>This is Beatrice Fairbanks.</i>
<i>Beatrice had attended
 a rather strict etiquette school</i>
<i>on a biweekly basis.</i>
<i>And doing so...</i>
<i>... Beatrice had been
 quietly instilled with a certain</i>
<i>Victorian idolatry.</i>
<i>A paragon of virtue.</i>
<i>Beatrice had been forced at a young age</i>
<i>to learn the works of Bach, Chopin</i>
<i>and other masters of classical music.</i>
<i>Though secretly she'd always
 wanted to play jazz.</i>
<i>Oddly...</i>
<i>Beatrice had opted to
 become a editorial model.</i>
It's okay. It's okay.
<i>An occupation that only
 heightened her insecurities.</i>
It's magnificent.
Stop!
One... two...
It's this that I want.
 It's this, you see. It's magnificent.
<i>Beatrice was a firm believer
 in mystics, psychics.</i>
<i>And the occult.</i>
<i>Which ran counter to the debutante norm.</i>
<i>Which favored incessant psycho analysis.</i>
What does it mean?
So, what do you think of my cologne?
Oh, that's you?
You probably... didn't get a good...
It's a little feminine.
The woman at Bergdorf's
 told me it was unisex.
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>She was clearly lying.</i>
He smells pretty. Doesn't he?
<i>Um... Beatrice this is my...</i>
... friend, Conrad.
Conrad. Beatrice.
- We've met.
 - Just briefly.
<i>On the subway.</i>
- Subway?
 - Um-hmm.
- I gave him my, uh...
 - Scarf.
She gave me her scarf.
 It was cold.
<i>- I'm gonna need that back from you.
 - Okay.</i>
I'll give it to you.
Um-hmm.
I can get it... from you.
- To give to her.
 - I'm gonna...
I think I see foie gras.
You want some? Hm?
 Duck?
No. Take your time.
Uh...
That's when I save you.
Obviously, I've got a target on my back.
I didn't even know it.
 I didn't even know it!
And, listen to this...
My mistress says,
 she doesn't want to have sex.
She's afraid she'd get pregnant.
Hm.
We have intercourse.
The only way that's going to
 happen is to immaculate conception.
Didn't you say she was on the pill?
Yeah, yeah, she is, but she said
 she's afraid of the 1 % and...
<i>Besides, she wants to get off.
 It gives her mood swings.</i>
Awful. Just awful.
You already have a wife who
 doesn't want to sleep with you.
Touch√©.
Don't you find that the... the...
... the virtuous ideals
 of the Victorian authors is...
- ... unrealistic and sentimental?
 - No.
Not at all.
And as the century went on
 the scope of the genre
became far more complex.
You do realize that the...
 the moniker of Victorian literature
ranges from the Bront√´ sisters to Kipling.
Yes.
Have you ever actually read
 any of their books?
No, but I'm...
... heavily considering it.
She wouldn't have left, she...
... she would have asked
 me to say goodbye...
There she is.
Eh...
Hi.
So, where... where are you heading now?
Oh, I have to go to bed.
 I have work in the morning.
Yeah, me too.
So, what are you working on these days?
Nothing in particular.
I'm open to ideas.
You sound very ambitious.
Actually I'm in the
 gathering stages of a novel.
It is to be one of the great
New York novels.
In the tradition of Fitzgerald.
Edith Wharton.
You've been in the gathering
 stages for over a decade.
Well, good things take time.
 I rushed my first novel.
I don't want to suffer the same pitfalls
 as my predecessors with my sophomore effort.
I don't think you finished you first novel.
I'm pretty sure it can't
 qualify as a sophomore effort
if you don't finish you first book.
Nonetheless.
Everybody knows that there are
 certain pitfalls associated with
a sophomore effort
 that I simply want to avoid.
Period.
- When do you plan on doing it?
  - Dylan!
Well...
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Don't you try anything.
I won't.
Don't try anything.
I won't.
Don't.
I...
<i>Nearly 30 minutes had passed.</i>
<i>And Beatrice could still feel
 a rush from Conrad's flirtation.</i>
Don't try anything.
I won't.
Not this one.
Dylan?
I won't.
Don't try anything.
I won't.
<i>The two friends competitive nature,</i>
<i>which had span nearly 3 decades,</i>
<i>stemmed from the simple fact that</i>
<i>each not only envied the other...</i>
<i>... but wanted secretly to be the other.</i>
<i>Neither one ever spoke of this.</i>
You know just cause you're almost 40
still getting a weekly allowance
 from your parents,
doesn't mean you can just do nothing
for the rest of your life.
First of all, I'm writing a novel...
... as you well know.
Secondly...
... your statement is completely subjective and
 lacking any substantive facts.
You're walking down a
 very dangerous road, my friend.
What road is that?
The road to fantasy land.
<i>Ah.</i>
And when you take a trip to fantasy land,
 you should always have a return ticket.
I don't even know what that means.
At some point you're gonna have
 to come to the same realization I did.
- What's that?
 - The rest of the world...
... is never gonna love you
 as much as your parents do.
Weren't you adopted?
I don't understand why
 you're interested in this guy.
He's just another
philandering, affluent type.
Doomed to chronic alcoholism.
Perpetual adolescence.
 And...
Death by syphilis.
He probably sits around, all day,
 drinking Tom Collins and just...
... performing acts of mental masturbation.
That is suck an unfair generalization.
He's not like that.
 For your information, he is writing a novel.
Oh...
Aren't we all.
So, I'm thinking about
 taking it to the next level
with Beatrice and actually
 asking her out to dinner tonight.
Hm.
Bad move.
Why?
You just saw her last night.
You don't want to crowd her and
 make her think you're too eager.
You definitely wait.
How long?
I don't know, Dylan. A day, at least.
- Really?
 - Yeah.
Really.
Beatrice.
Yes, that's my plane.
I never understood why someone would
 want to be a vegetarian.
I mean, do you really
 love animals that much?
No, no, no.
 I just hate plants.
You eat fish though, right?
Why?
All the vegetarians eat fish.
Well, I'm a Pisces.
What's that got to do with it?
I don't eat my own kind.
Beatrice, tell me.
 What is it like being a model?
All those people staring at you?
It's like any other job.
Innocuous and demoralizing.
 But it pays well.
I'm serious, tell me about yourself.
All I know is that you, you, you do frequent
to subway and, and you read Victorian,
 Pre-Victorian literature.
Right?
Come on, I want to know... I want to know your fears.
I'd like to know your hopes.
I want to know political ideologies
 and sexual preference.
I don't care in what order.
It's a lot of information for a first date.
That's true.
How about you, what is it like being
 born with a proverbial silver spoon?
Right.
Well, ah, you know it, it is,...
 it's like any other job.
It's innocuous and demoralizing
 but pays really well.
<i>Beatrice was different.</i>
<i>As their conversation continued...</i>
<i>... the two spoke of French cinema.</i>
<i>The classic literature.</i>
<i>He tried to be witty.</i>
<i>To make her laugh.</i>
<i>And for a moment,
 he was able to statue...</i>
<i>... a bust of an Aphrodite that he could
 only remember it's gentle eyes.</i>
But not with the statue itself in vain.
Should we go and have a cigarette?
Okay, yeah.
<i>Conrad often became attached
 to the idea of something.</i>
<i>And not the the actual thing itself.</i>
So what is your novel about?
I'm not so sure.
 I'm still figuring that part out.
I want you to try this.
- Why, what is it?
 - This is...
It's a Valmont executive.
It is my family's brand.
It is... It's only the rarest and
 most exquisite cigarette
in existence.
It is pretty great.
It sort of tastes like any other cigarette.
But what about the smell?
 Right? Smell?
It smells like any other too.
 I mean, maybe I'm missing...
You don't  get it.
You just don't get it.
 I'm gonna take two of them.
Oh.
That's good. That's healthy.
<i>As the day wore on...</i>
<i>... Beatrice was playing hard to get.</i>
<i>Conrad's pseudo-intellectual
 banter was wearing thin.</i>
<i>And so he decided
 to proceed to plan B.</i>
<i>Get her drunk.</i>
Well, I, I know you don't drink but
 they make an incredible Tom Collins.
Okay?
How often do you come here?
Uh... every once in a while.
Here you go, Mr. Valmont.
Lucky.
- Cheers.
 - Cheers.
Weird how nobody
 dances anymore, you know?
It's funny, coming from
 someone who's not dancing.
I don't dance.
You know, you're nothing
 like Dylan described.
Why? What did he say?
He said you were self-inhibited
 and that you didn't drink.
Well, a woman can wear many hats.
Oh, yeah, what does that mean?
It means a woman can be inhibited and
 conservative with one man and...
... virtually be opposite with another.
Oh, boy.
Even socialist regime's wait until they're
 demised before they admit such insincerity.
Well, I'm not a socialist regime.
 I'm a woman.
- You play that thing?
 - A little bit.
- Can you play me a song?
 - No.
- Come on?
 - Uh-uh.
- Please.
 - Sorry.
- Beatrice.
 - I'm not in the mood.
- Are you gonna make me beg?
 - Maybe.
Come on? Please?
Just...
... one.
<i>Beatrice loved the way
 Conrad walked into a room.</i>
<i>The way he waved his hands
 in the air every time he heard Bach.</i>
<i>The way he read her exerts of
 Fitzgerald's short fiction before bed.</i>
<i>The precision with which he made a Tom Collins.</i>
<i>And a single Windsor knot.</i>
<i>He's infallible wit and charm.</i>
<i>And the way he used words like...</i>
<i>... haberdashery.</i>
<i>But most importantly...</i>
<i>... Beatrice loved the way
 he looked at her.</i>
<i>Conrad loved the way Beatrice
 walked into a room.</i>
<i>How she laughed at his jokes no matter how
 convoluted or juvenile they seemed.</i>
<i>They way she bit her lip the moment
 before she played the piano.</i>
<i>The softness of her skin.</i>
<i>The yellow in her eyes.</i>
<i>The mole on her thigh.</i>
<i>But most importantly...</i>
<i>... Conrad loved to look at her.</i>
<i>Unfortunately...</i>
<i>... there were still two unavoidable problems.</i>
<i>Dylan...</i>
<i>... and...</i>
<i>... that Conrad was broke.</i>
<i>But most importantly...</i>
<i>... that he was lying concerning both.</i>
You ever notice, when people become happy,
 they pack on a few extra pounds?
What are you trying to say?
No, no, no no.
 Nothing about you, angel.
No, no, no. I'm just...
 I'm making an observation.
Oh.
Are you saying that all fat people are happy?
Not at all. No.
I'm merely stating that there are
 two categories of fat people.
There is happy-fat and there is...
... just fat.
No, no no, please!
 Give me a little space.
I'm trying to cook, you know.
 It's not natural...
Hey.
That water is brown. That can't be...
- ... healthy.
 - That's how I like it.
- Really?
 - Yeah.
- You want me to get that?
 - No.
Well, how am I supposed
 to wash my hands?
-There's egg all over them.
 - Hello?
Hey, Dylan.
Uh, no, I'm not doing anything.
Oh, tonight?
Uhh....
Oh!
Yeah, oh, can you hang on one second?
He wants to take me to the theater tonight
 and he wants me to bring a date for you.
I'm, I'm not that good of a liar.
I sincerely doubt that.
No, I'm sorry, we can't... I...
... I can't.
You did?
Oh, that's so nice of you.
Okay, well, then I'll see you at 7.
Okay. Bye.
There's nothing I could do.
This is a bad idea.
I don't understand why you and
 Dylan always have to get into these
prepubescent competitions, of which
he always loses?!
I resent that. You know I make a conscious effort
 to stay out of all forms of competitions.
Your track record proves otherwise.
This girl's important.
You know, if there's
 anything I can... I can do.
You've heard anything?
 I can't get anyone to return my calls.
The rumors... are just...
... rumors.
I don't want to get into details.
But I've only got 36 hours
 of clean underwear left.
I've got no idea what to do, you know,
 I feel like Napoleon...
... after Waterloo.
Dieing in exile on the coast of Saint Helena.
It's gonna be alright, Conny.
- You think?
 - Look, I promise you.
Gonna be alright.
Alright.
- Listen! I need to take the antiques!
 - You don't need to...
They were in my family...
- ... and they belong to me.
 - You family, your family.
That desk was from Marie Antoinette!
- Yes, it was!
 - It's a fake!
<i>I'm sorry, Sir. No one is picking up.
 Is there another number you'd like to try?</i>
Um.
No, no, that's okay.
That's fine, thank you.
- I think that's a pretty good pairing over there.
 - Mm-hmm.
He's very... opinionated and...
... judgmental.
- I told you this was a bad idea.
 - Shut up. Shut up!
Well then, tell me about it!
<i>Seriously?</i>
<i>Yes, seriously. Of course!
 Here I am...</i>
<i>Is this a joke?</i>
<i>What a pitiful advocate you are.</i>
<i>Speak, whether it's a joke or not.</i>
<i>Uhh... why are you looking all
 around the room like that?</i>
<i>Oh you... you really are in a temper!</i>
<i>I wish to take a lover, Octave, or if not a lover,
 at least a cavalier. Whom do you suggest?</i>
<i>I shall abide by your choice from...</i>
<i>... from tomorrow, from this evening, where ever,
 [...] beneath my window, you'll find my door ajar.</i>
<i>Well? Nothing to say?</i>
Marry me!
Sure don't like the way
 you're looking at Dylan tonight.
I am not doing anything.
Okay, maybe it's me, but I don't know.
 Just stop it.
I don't know.
I didn't even understand any of the Parisian speech.
 I think they were Canadian.
- Good evening, Mr.Valmont!
 - Ah, Didier!
- You're usual table is waiting.
 - Great. Thank you.
Will you be paying tonight or
 putting it on the book?
It will be on the books.
And... and that goes for the whole table.
Ah, very well.
 Please, right this way.
Good evening.
No, just a little bit. I'll just have a little.
What did you think?
I don't know.
 I felt that it was sort of pretentious.
Mm-hmm.
It seemed like everyone who was
 in the theater was just there to be seen.
There to be seen?
It was a theater.
 It was pitch black in there.
How am I supposed to
care about a group of
 overprivileged affluent types
who go gallivanting around without
 any sort of a moral compass?
Yeah, affluent types have plenty of problems.
 I'm a mess.
I'm sorry but I'm very sensitive to
 an audience's reaction and
I couldn't get into it.
Say, all jumped off a bridge,
 would you join them?
I hate that analogy. I really do.
But maybe. Maybe there's a reason
 for why they are all doing that.
Maybe the bridge is about
 to explode and no one told me.
That's a good point.
Ugh! I'm just...
How am I supposed to sympathize
 with these characters?
No one suffers any
 consequences for their actions.
No one learns anything and nobody changes.
It was a satire.
I didn't get that at all.
I love this place.
 It's so chic!
Wait, I thought you said
 that the door policy was
discriminatory and
 this place was insipid?
Oh, ah, I did say that but
 that was before I came inside.
I'm gonna go.
Count to five and then follow me.
<i>Ooh.</i>
<i>Are you wearing perfume?</i>
<i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>Don't you feel a little bit strange
 about being an artist</i>
<i>in a world that's already so full of art.
 Isn't that sort of a waste?</i>
<i>I forget, what do you do?</i>
<i>I'm getting a doctorate at
 Columbia in post-modern criticism.</i>
<i>For me, I think that people who
 are creative are really just indulgent.</i>
There's already so much, we don't...
We don't need anymore and there are so
 many people who are without.
You know... you should...
... just be be a farmer.
You can always tell what someone thinks of you
 by who they set you up with.
The only reason that I'm dancing
 with you is that I'm incredibly drunk.
I despise you and everything
 that you stand for.
- Where's Conrad?
 - I don't know.
You want to get another drink?
You're a bit of a filasteen, aren't you?
I'm sorry, wait.
 Tell me your name again.
Jocelyn.
What? Are you kidding me?
I just got out of a 3-year
 relationship with a Jocelyn.
Do you want to sleep over?
Your place or mine?
I live in a dorm.
Definitely mine.
You know I realized
 something the other day.
Usually the women that I like
 as human beings, I'm not sexually attracted to.
And the ones that I'm sexually attracted to,
 I don't particularly like as human beings.
On the rare occasion,
when one of them falls into both categories,
 they usually have a boyfriend or a husband.
What are you trying to say?
I'm trying to say.
What I'm trying to say is...
You know, it's great that
 you don't have a boyfriend.
Oh, but I am married.
 Is that a problem?
- You're a cheater, thought, right?
 - Oh, mm-hm, yeah.
I got to tell Dylan.
I've got to tell him.
Right? You tell him.
Tell him right out. You just...
Just let him know.
You just tell him.
 Got to tell him.
You got to tell him.
 Got to tell him.
You got to tell him.
Oh, God!
<i>This was it.</i>
<i>This was the moment
 Conrad would right his wrongs.</i>
Hey.
<i>This was the moment he would
 bare his soul to his only friend...</i>
- What's going on?
 <i>... and tell him of his betrayal.</i>
<i>This was the moment Conrad
 would ask for forgiveness.</i>
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing at all. What?
 Does something seem like it's going on?
Yeah, it seemed like you were
 about to say something.
No, uh-uh, no, no, not at all.
 Where's your friend?
Oh, you mean... ah... Jocelyn.
No, the friend.
Yeah, the friend's name is Jocelyn.
Oh, really?
- Ironic?
 - I don't want to talk about it.
Didn't have sex with her, huh?
No, I didn't have sex with her.
 I did talk to her...
... all night.
 She only left half an hour ago.
It was horrible.
So, what happened last night?
<i>What happened was that</i>
<i>it was amazing and
 we talked until the sun came up!</i>
That's amazing!
I have something
 I have to ask you.
Yes?
Are you sleeping with Beatrice?
Ah.
No.
No.
Good.
Good man.
Something I'd like to ask you.
May I sleep with Beatrice?
Definitely not.
No.
Got something I'd like to tell you.
- What is it now?
 - Beatrice and I are already together.
- Dylan, Dylan, Dylan!
 - Who are you...!
Now as we ease into adulthood,
 sometimes a good stiff drink
is the only excuse we have for
 committing the atrocity we really...
- Ease into adulthood?
 - Yes.
We're nearly 40!
I said I was sorry.
You're a selfish asshole.
Hang on.
Selfish?
Dylan, you're the one that's selfish.
I might actually have a shot with her.
Okay? She could be...
... the one.
The one?!
What are you 14?
 It's not charming anymore, Conrad.
I need you to sleep
 somewhere else tonight.
You're kicking me out?
And you realize by kicking me out,
 I probably move in with Beatrice?
Sometimes you are you're own worst enemy.
<i>Conrad's ability to trust had been marked
 by years of betrayal and deceit.</i>
<i>For others had only dated or befriended him
 to gain access to his wealth.</i>
<i>He had been quoted on numerous occasions
 saying that no one can be trusted.</i>
<i>What he forgot to add was...</i>
<i>... that included himself.</i>
Well, I feel very, very conflicted.
I, I like the idea of,
 of living up at the summer home.
You know, upstate?
 Life of a reclusive writer?
I really do. But I'm allergic to the grass.
The clean air. The bees. The ticks. The...
... badgers.
Bunch of wildlife.
What are you trying to say Conrad?
I'm gonna move in with Beatrice.
Oh...
Oh, that's great news.
Thank you.
Does she know that you're broke and
 have no place else to go?
Ha!
Oh, yes.
Don't you feel guilty about Dylan?
Obviously.
But you know,
 this is actually a very small city.
And if you meet an attractive girl,
 the chances are great
that one of you friends has
 already slept with her or wants to.
You're lying to yourself, Conrad.
I know.
I'm okay with it.
Ding-dong!
Hey.
Good day, my love.
- What's going on?
 - I'm moving in.
What happened to Dylan's?
I was allergic to his sheets.
 Egyptian cotton.
I have Egyptian cotton.
Well, we have to do
 something about that.
Huh.
I think I'm in love with you.
How? It's only been two days.
Well then, I'm in love with the idea of you.
Not the actual me?
Well, the idea of someone
 is always better.
You can't have sex with an idea.
I'm telling you.
Don't put a scratch on it.
- I won't.
 - Your father is going to kill me.
She's waiting.
Ah! There it is.
Well, what do you see there?
Well, I mean it's obvious.
Right.
Explosive. It's explosive.
A car. Right?
Do you see that?
You see just the headlights?
It's a female orgasm.
- I think it's kind of clear. I mean...
 - That the driver is having?
What's wrong?
Umm...
Nothing.
<i>Sitting at Beatrice's piano,
 Conrad quietly read Dylan's note.</i>
<i>"I lieu of unnecessary explanations...</i>
<i>... please enjoy this Volvo."</i>
<i>Conrad began to feel an odd sensation.</i>
<i>One of guilt.</i>
<i>He had never felt the emotion before.</i>
I think I have a brain tumor.
What?!
Nothing.
I'm not... I'm not...
 I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You're never in the mood anymore.
We had sex last night.
Yeah.
You seemed a little...
... distant.
Or we're just going through a dry spell.
A dry spell?
That's all.
It's only been a week.
<i>Watching Beatrice as she
 delicately played the piano...</i>
<i>... Conrad felt horrible for
 his ceaseless deception.</i>
<i>For a moment he contemplated
 admitting his impoverishment.</i>
<i>Then...</i>
<i>... the moment passed.</i>
And how can I be with someone
 that doesn't appreciate Bach?
Or Valmont?
This is a classic story, Conrad.
'Pygmalion'.
Have you even read 'Pygmalion'?
 This has nothing to do with 'Pygmalion'.
You should revisit that.
Or then get the notes or
 I'll read it to you.
<i>I've seen 'My Fair Lady'.</i>
<i>Okay, Beatrice, stop right there!
 Don't move! Okay? Don't move.</i>
<i>Like that.</i>
<i>Beautiful. You're beautiful. It's magnificent.</i>
<i>Don't move. Don't move.
 Look at me!</i>
<i>Give me love, give me love.
 Voil√†! You love me?</i>
<i>Smile.</i>
<i>Voil√†! You love me?</i>
You love me? Okay, show me! Show me.
Show me you love me. Show me.
Okay... LOVE!
<i>HATE... LOVE! Like that.</i>
Beautiful, beautiful. Love?
Hate!
Love?
One more?
Chapter one.
Greece was a place he had
 visited many times in his mind.
But on this day...
Jumping forward. Chapter three.
Chapter four.
So, how long are they gonna be
 remodeling the Valmont?
- Uh... a couple of months, maybe.
 - What?
I think. Sometimes it takes a couple of months.
- You said weeks.
 - Well.
Oh!
Hey!
Hey, I got your... gift.
Well, as good as it is to bump into you guys,
 I have to go. I've got my opening tonight.
What part of town is that in?
- Weidman Gallery.
 - Well, we'll see you there.
Don't know, we have...
... time!
Who's that girl?
- Jocelyn.
 - That's not Jocelyn!
I know, the, ah....
... the other Jocelyn.
Let's get in this car, come on.
I got to go.
<i>Conrad had often professed
 that he led a life of the mind.</i>
<i>Unfortunately for him...</i>
<i>... his mind had been
 damaged by years of abandonment.</i>
<i>Philandering... Tom Collins...</i>
<i>... and a two pack per day nicotine habit.</i>
<i>Not the mention an unhealthy
 Oedipal complex.</i>
<i>The weight of his guilt had
 finally become too heavy.</i>
<i>The incessant charade
 could go on no longer.</i>
What's wrong?
Where were you?
You left me at the concert.
You stayed, huh?
Actually, I did.
It was beautiful.
We're out of cigarettes.
Where are we going?
To the Valmont.
- Reuben!
 - Why are we hiding behind the bushes?
Follow me on the count to 3.
- What?
 - Ready? Go!
What?
- Timothy!
 - I... ah... Fredrick. I don't believe you're supposed to...
Mr. Valmont. Mr. Valmont!
Stop them!
- What is going on? This is crazy.
 - I know.
Isn't it fun?
Where are we going?
Why are we...?
Come in.
Please turn on the lights.
 What is happening?
It's a game. Hey, if you see
 my mother's jewels, get those!
What?! No! We should not do that!
Hah?
I showed her,
 that washed up debutante.
Shit.
Really, really good work Timothy.
It's Fredrick, sir.
Yes. Fredrick, sorry, yeah, I know.
 I thank you lot for picking up the pace.
You know where to return mother's jewels.
Right? That's the penthouse.
 The East wing.
The Rhodesian cabinet, third drawer.
I've got my cigarettes.
Please tell Bernard that I'm very sorry.
I'll be right there, honey!
What was that all about?
I'm not sure I even know anymore.
Conrad, what is going on?
You know, Beatrice...
I only moved in with you because
 I've got no place else to go.
- Okay, I'm broke.
 - What do you mean?
I have nothing.
I was kicked out of the Valmont.
 Parents cut me off.
Conrad, you're nearly 40 years old.
Well, that's...
... completely irrelevant.
 I've got separation anxiety. Abandonment issues.
Are you saying you've been
 lying to me this entire time?
Yes...
But...
I'm not the only liar.
I saw you with Dylan earlier today.
What?!
You've been following me now?
I...
I was trying to patch things
 up between you, God!
Grow up!
You are not honest with yourself.
 That's your problem.
Okay? You're always acting so virtuous.
You're always talking about how you
 want to be a bohemian musician.
In the end...
... you're just a model.
Well, at least I have a job.
You have just managed
 to coast through life
without worrying about money or
 anything else pertaining to reality.
You are just a philandering narcissist
who's so afraid of being alone
 because when you are alone
you're gonna realize how empty your life is.
You know what?
 I should have gone with Dylan.
Because between the two of you,
 he was the nice one.
You are insufferable.
Didn't seem to bother you
 when I was flipping the bill!
Alright? You're just like the rest of them.
You were only with me for the money.
I am the only girl you have ever been
 with who wasn't just in it for the money.
And besides, you were broke!
Well..
You didn't know that.
So...
<i>Staring into the grill of a bread truck.</i>
<i>Conrad couldn't help but think of the poor woman
 who had been diagnosed with 'Witzelsucht'.</i>
<i>The joking disease.</i>
<i>In a daze...</i>
<i>... he suddenly began to speak fluent German.</i>
<i>Though he had never studied the language.</i>
I think...
... there's something...
... wrong...
... with me.
<i>He promptly lost consciousness.</i>
- Where does it hurt?
 - Ahh...
Everywhere.
<i>Conrad's worst fear had come true.</i>
<i>He was all alone.</i>
Hello?
<i>Who is this?</i>
It's your son, Conrad. Hi.
<i>- Honey. </i>
 - What's the... where are you?
What's that noise?
<i>Can't you see I'm preoccupied?</i>
When are you coming home?
<i>I don't know, darling.
 The boys of this stature can take some time.</i>
How long do you think?
<i>No, look. I ... I have to go.</i>
Maybe this won't blow over.
I just saw the most amazing performance piece
where a husband and wife tie themselves
 together with a ten foot rope for an entire year.
<i>It was a commentary on the modern relationship.</i>
<i>That is the most beautiful
 metaphor I've ever heard.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
They got a divorce.
Hm.
I heard you met with Beatrice earlier.
She was trying to get me to what...
- ... we're doing, right now.
 - Yeah.
Dylan, I guess you were right.
On what?
Sometimes I am my own worst enemy.
What happened to your face?
Got hit by a truck.
Zeus is dead.
You can fetter my leg...
... but Zeus himself can not
 get the better of my free will.
And I want my Volvo back.
 That was just a joke.
And how are things with Jocelyn?
Oh, we broke up again.
This time is for good.
 I think she was stealing from me.
That's rough.
How are things with Beatrice?
- Not so good.
 - No?
Well, it's not a surprise considering
 what an asshole you are.
I resent that.
Well, you should. It was an insult.
You're not still mad at me,
 are you?
Not at all.
Maybe a little.
Really thought Beatrice and I were gonna last.
What is it?
- Hi.
 - Hi.
Now you two seem like..
... fans of literature.
I have got a very impressive
 library at my apartment.
- Really?
 - Mm-hm.
You wanna see my Balzac collection?
You sure you don't
 want to do it out here?
No. I can't sorry.
It... it would be a misrepresentation
 of how I feel inside.
I... I don't even now what that means.
Well... that's exactly the problem.
You can, uh... keep the Volvo.
Beatrice, it's Conrad.
Give me a call.
Call me back.
What do you see, Conrad?
Sex.
And now?
Beatrice... I mean... sex.
Anyway... Beatrice.
Now?
Sex.
This isn't healthy, Conrad.
I know that.
<i>Meanwhile...</i>
<i>Beatrice visited her upper west side mystic</i>
<i>in an attempt to find similar
 answers to her quandary.</i>
<i>Unfortunately...</i>
<i>... her prospects were less than ideal.</i>
<i>I mean I, I, I, I've only just moved in.
 She's already kicked me out.</i>
<i>I... I don't know.
 I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>Sometimes we have to make sacrifices
 for the ones we love.</i>
<i>This literally moral code of yours
 is completely unrealistic.</i>
<i>This isn't a, a Jane Austin novel.
 And I, I'm certainly not Emily Post.</i>
<i>You have the moral
 code of a Bolshevik, Conrad.</i>
<i>I mean, I'm, I'm,
 I'm having an existential crises here.</i>
<i>I can't stop thinking about her.
 I think I need to see a doctor.</i>
<i>Conrad...</i>
<i>... I am a doctor.</i>
Beatrice?
Beatrice?
Note to self:
... upon a second reading...
... my analyst was correct.
 It has everything to do with 'Pygmalion'.
Dylan?
Wake up.
What? What is it?
I need Jocelyn's phone number.
Look at me. Look at me.
Voil√†. Like that. Magnificent.
Like a little bird.
Ah, voil√†.
Love?
Hate!
Stop! Don't move. Voil√†.
Super... super.
[...] And one for the road.
Huh.
Okay, that's ah... let's take a break.
 Hm?
Hi.
What happened to your head?
I got hit by a truck.
Yeah.
I like this music selection.
Who's is it?
What are you doing here?
I'm quiting.
The whole act.
Look...
... it wasn't the act that bothered me.
 It was the cover-up.
Well, the act was the cover-up.
I have to go back to work.
Can I have one hour?
I just need one hour.
- Okay. One hour.
 - Yeah.
Thanks. I'll be right here.
- I hate surprises.
 - You're gonna like this one.
- I don't understand.
 - It's for both of us.
Don't get to excited.
 It's just a rental.
You didn't?
I did.
How?
There's no leaks in the ceiling.
Got his and hers bathrooms.
This water is not brown.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
So...
... did you actually go to
 the Picasso retrospect of last week?
<i>It was horrid.</i>
<i>I know.</i>
<i>I, I'm sorry, but, I find his work</i>
pretentious and adolescent.
You know, if, uh...
<i>If people just would... take a step back</i>
<i>- ...and have some... </i>
 - Do you ever notice
that the people who make fun of people for being
 pretentious are usually the pretentious ones?
Do you ever notice how...
... people only lash out on others...
... because they're afraid of what they see.
Cause they see themselves.
What if I tell you I love you,
 does that mean I actually love myself?
Exactly.
I love you.
I love you too.
<i>It was at that moment...</i>
<i>Conrad and Beatrice knew that it was over.</i>
<i>Beatrice couldn't help but
 feel sympathy for Conrad.</i>
<i>Not love.</i>
<i>But sympathy.</i>
<i>One can often get confused for the other.</i>
<i>As the two exit to the station...</i>
<i>... they waved goodbye
 to one another as usual.</i>
<i>It would be the last time...</i>
<i>... they would ever see each other.</i>
<i>It seemed there was an unavoidable distinction</i>
<i>between Conrad and Beatrice
 that had rendered them incompatible.</i>
<i>She was a hopeless romantic.</i>
<i>And he was romantically hopeless.</i>
<i>By the weeks end..</i>
<i>... Conrad had received a telegram
 informing him of his parents reconciliation.</i>
<i>Their week long divorce had grown tiresome.</i>
<i>And they were to return
 home in two days time.</i>
<i>As much as Beatrice had tried...</i>
<i>She was unable to forget Conrad's actions.</i>
Note to self: see doctor about possible brain tumor.
<i>Conrad went on to keep the empty
 apartment as a sort of metaphor...</i>
<i>... for the void, left by Beatrice.</i>
<i>He told no one of it's existence.</i>
<i>It wasn't till years later
 that Conrad would realize...</i>
<i>... love was just like communism.</i>
<i>It was a great idea...
 but never quite worked out.</i>
<i>Conrad may have told others
 that he was in search of a girlfriend...</i>
<i>... a future wife...</i>
<i>... but it was merely rhetoric.</i>
<i>Conrad search was for an
 idyllic beauty he would never attain.</i>
<i>Conrad often became attached
 to the idea of something.</i>
<i>And not the actual thing itself.</i>
<i>Back at the Valmont,
 with his credit cards once again active...</i>
<i>... Conrad resumed the life
 he was accustomed to living.</i>
<i>But something was different.</i>
Like this one, right there!
 Get that one!
I missed it.
Okay, why the hell are we
 fishing with spears?
What's wrong?
It's been a long week.
<i>With the matriarch of the
 Valmont household once again home...</i>
<i>... Conrad was able to load out
 a decade of emotions and fears...</i>
<i>...for she had long been the
 only person that he would truly confide in.</i>
I think there's something wrong with me.
<i>In an attempt to change his ways</i>
- Ding-dong!
 <i>- Conrad started down the road</i>
<i>to redemption with the simple gesture...</i>
<i>... of quiting cigarettes...</i>
<i>.. of getting his father's
 Austin-Healey out of park.</i>
<i>And on one spring afternoon,
 when Dylan was out...</i>
<i>... Conrad snuck into his friends
 apartment to finally repay him.</i>
<i>He not only monetarily compensated
 Dylan for his loan...</i>
<i>... but also included the keys to his Volvo.</i>
<i>And an inflation-adjusted interest of 20 %.</i>
These are classic symptoms.
 I think you're a closet agoraphobic.
I'm terminating our secessions.
Conrad!
Can we talk about this later.
 I'm in the middle of secession.
I don't care.
I'm getting worse.
Beatrice broke up with me and
 I got hit by a truck.
Look at me. I'm a mess.
Why do you think that is?
Your bad advice.
Conrad, I've been your therapist
 since you were 9 years old.
Indeed.
I think it's all that bad advice
 it made me the bad person I am today.
It's gonna take a very long time
 to recover from this.
Farewell.
Perhaps he had the wrong office.
Hypothetically speaking...
... do you think someone could have a Napoleonic complex
 without being particularity short?
I don't believe so.
What would you call this
 hypothetical person then?
An egoist?
Egoist?
I think I'm an egoist.
I never told you this before but...
... you're a horrible writer.
I know.
<i>After several years of deliberation
 and public speculation</i>
<i>Conrad had finally finished
 his sophomore effort.</i>
<i>His inability to complete
 the novel had simply stemmed</i>
<i>from his lack of understanding
 it's central character.</i>
<i>Of course, the central character...</i>
<i>... was himself.</i>
<i>The book was published in the spring.</i>
<i>And received mixed reviews.</i>
He proceeded to wave
 goodbye to Abigail, as if routine.
For he was convinced...
... that this was not the last time...
... that the would ever see each other.
Harold went on to keep
 the empty apartment
as sort of metaphor for
 the void left by Abigail.
He told no one...
... of it's existence.
Thank you.
How do you respond to the criticism
 that your novel is inherently derivative
of the works of Fitzgerald and Edith Wharton?
Thank you.
Mr. Valmont!
I'm sorry, but I found the book,
 and the central character,
adolescent and his problems grossly inconsequential
 by modern social standards.
Don't you find his change at the end
 slightly contrived and frankly...
... sophomoric?
I completely disagree. I find him quite likable
 and his change rather significant.
<i>At a matin√© performance
 of 'Les Caprice de Marianne'...</i>
<i>... the play which, the once tightly
 knit group, had all seen together...</i>
<i>... Dylan ran into Beatrice for the
 first time since her split with Conrad.</i>
<i>This was not a coincidence however.</i>
<i>For each had mysteriously
 received a ticket two days prior.</i>
<i>Conrad had sent the tickets in attempt to pay
 penance for his actions the previous week,</i>
<i>The two then went to a small bar in
 the West Village to speak about the play.</i>
<i>They both enjoyed it and had seen it
 with an nostalgia for their old times together.</i>
<i>They made love that night...</i>
<i>... and had been together ever since.</i>
<i>Dylan finally read Jane Austin's pre-Victorian classic:
 'Sense and Sensibility'.</i>
<i>He found it neither sentimental nor unrealistic.</i>
<i>But actually quite relatable.</i>
<i>Soon after their encounter
 outside the Hudson Playhouse...</i>
<i>... Beatrice gave up her modeling exploits
 and formed a jazz ensemble with Dylan.</i>
<i>They had achieved moderate
 success and were happy.</i>
<i>Consequently...</i>
<i>... they both put on 15 pounds.</i>
<i>Conrad and Dylan continued their
 weekly conversations over squash.</i>
<i>And for the first time...</i>
<i>... Dylan won.</i>
<i>Conrad saw this as a sign of change.</i>
<i>Dylan however...</i>
<i>... merely felt as sense of satisfaction.</i>
<i>Conrad would go on to donate
 a large portion of his wealth</i>
<i>to various charities and
 philanthropic endeavors.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, it took loosing everything
 for Conrad to finally appreciate</i>
<i>the economic stability he once had.</i>
<i>He wasn't going to take it
 for granted this time.</i>
<i>I really despise the whole idea that</i>
<i>by being over privileged and well educated
 they want us to live up to lofty expectations.</i>
For one, you have to live under  the proverbial
 shadow of , say father and or namesake.
Two...
... lofty expectations can
 only lead to failure. Hm?
And three...
... most scientifically and
 mathematically speaking...
... if you're parents were a great success,
 I think the betting man will say
that the chances of lighting striking
 twice in specially in consecutive generations
is very slim.
You do realize,
 you're talking to your chauffeur.
Touch√©.
<i>After the lukewarm
 reception of his second novel,</i>
<i>Conrad began to spend
 more time in the country.</i>
<i>To focus... on the work.</i>
<i>For it was only there...</i>
<i>... that he felt at ease.</i>
<i>It appeared Conrad's allergies to grass and
 clean air had been completely psychosomatic.</i>
<i>He began to reflect back on his week
 with Beatrice and thought of the old adage:</i>
<i>... it's better to have loved and lost
 than to have never loved at all.</i>
<i>Conrad reluctantly agreed...</i>
<i>... for the still thought of Beatrice often.</i>
<i>At the ripe age of 42.</i>
<i>Conrad Valmont was finally...</i>
<i>... growing up.</i>
LOVE TO GO
 The longest week of my life.
