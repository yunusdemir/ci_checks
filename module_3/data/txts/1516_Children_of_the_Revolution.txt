The incredible thing about it is...
how close we came.
This country, Australia...
was a week away from a civil war.
Revolution, if you will.
And at the time, the public
didn't even know about it.
Did you know there are people
starving, Brendan?
Here, in this country, starving?
And in other countries?
And do you think for a moment
it's because there's not enough
to go around?
Do you? Does anyone?
Would anyone dare put that view?
This can't be the best system we
can have, Brendan. It just can't be.
And when I hear what
they're doing in Russia...
when I hear that one man
can't own another man...
use him up and replace him
when he breaks...
it's gotta be better.
It's just gotta be.
From each according to his capacity;
to each according to his needs.
That's a principle
for social organization.
<i>The prime minister
returned from his European tour...</i>
<i>vowing to step up the fight
against Communism in Australia.</i>
<i>He announced plans
for an national referendum...</i>
<i>a ballot which will ask
the Australian people to decide
whether or not the government...</i>
<i>should be given extra powers
to outlaw Communism.</i>
<i>Mr. Menzies'announcement
was a clear message to
Russian dictatorJoseph Stalin...</i>
<i>whose Communist empire
has continued to expand...</i>
<i>ever since the end
of the Second World War...</i>
<i>threatening Democracy
all over the globe.</i>
Oh, bullshit!
This is pure bullshit!
- Menzies is lying, comrades!
When the revolution comes,
you won't be made slaves!
And if, by means of revolution,
it makes itself the ruling class...
and as such sweeps away by force
the old conditions of production...
then it will,
along with those conditions,
have swept away the existence...
Are you embarrassed
to be seen with me?
What?
Are you embarrassed
to be seen with me?
Don't be ridiculous.
- I worry about you sometimes, Welch.
- Do you, Joan?
I'm talking about your commitment.
I mean, didn't what Menzies
said anger you at all?
Offend you? Irritate you? Rile you?
- I get your point, Joan.
- Well, didn't it?
- Didn't what what?
- Didn't it rile you, what Menzies said?
Oh, that. Of course i-it riled me.
I was riled.
- You didn't look riled.
- Joan, I was riled.
The fact that I wasn't
screaming abuse at the ushers
doesn't mean I wasn't riled.
It's just that sometimes, you know...
I get the impression...
and I know it might be unfair...
but I get the impression...
you do all this because of me...
and not because you believe.
We met in one of the book shops.
Darling Street, it was.
Tenth of May, 1949.
That was the day I joined the Balmain
branch of the Communist Party.
She was a very strong
and passionate woman.
And, you know, when, uh, Bern heard...
how much Joan loved Stalin...
he, uh, he...
He startin' gr...
growin' a mustache.
I never tried to grow a mustache.
That's just not true.
All I'm saying is that maybe
we shouldn't be hurrying.
I mean, we have got a lot
of powerful enemies, Joan.
- They want to see us in prison.
- So?
Isn't that worth going to prison for?
Well, isn't it?
What good'll we be in prison, Joan?
Stalin went to prison.
Lenin went to prison.
Anyone who's anyone in revolutionary
politics has been in prison.
Don't you think maybe we should
a bit more discreet?
Discreet? Oh, for God's sake!
We're not talking
about dance classes here.
We're talking about the bloody
proletarian revolution!
What do you people want,
a discreet revolution?
Look...
I'm not suggesting violence...
yet.
I'm just suggesting we march...
peacefully, mind you...
march on Parliament House.
Songs and posters and pamphlets...
and take over the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
Time, please!
Where's everybody going?
Oh, the pub shuts,
so the meeting's over?
Better toodle, love.
I don't know how we'll ever get
the revolution going, quite frankly...
with 6:00 closing.
Dear Comrade Leader...
I hope this letter finds both yourself
and the revolution in good health.
I apologize for not having written for
four days, but I have been very busy.
- I've been speaking to workers...
trying to make them understand
the oppression they would suffer...
if Menzies'attempt
to outlaw Communism succeeds.
Don't be afraid.
What do you want?
Just to talk.
Can I turn on the light?
Sure.
Do you know what I am?
- Bloody rude would have
to be my first guess.
Tomorrow, Joan Fraser...
you'll be handing out "How to vote"
cards at the Balmain Town Hall...
from dawn until
the ballot boxes shut.
You'll be voting just before 6:00.
You always do, just like your father.
Three days ago you were at
the rail sheds at Tempe...
handing out pamphlets featuring
the prime minister dressed as a Nazi.
Later that night you wrote
another in your long and
moving series of letters...
to Comrade UncleJoe.
- How did you get that?
- How do you think?
'Cause you're a spy for the fascists?
We prefer to call it the government.
The fascists.
As I said.
You do realize, Joan...
that if you lose the ballot tomorrow
and Communism is outlawed...
people like me will start rounding up
people like you in vans.
- But there is an alternative.
- Don't tell me.
You want me to become an informant.
I don't want to see you suffer, Joan.
Especially for something
you don't understand.
What don't I understand?
Stalinism. The Soviet Union.
- I've been there, Joan.
- It's a scary place.
- Why don't you try next door, Mr. Spy?
I could help you, Joan.
We'll meet again.
Only tonight did I realize
the lengths the fascists will go to...
to crush us, to crush you.
The things they would have
people believe about you...
I'm scared, Comrade.
I need to know you're there.
It's not that I'm doubting you.
It's me. Do I have the strength?
When I received her letter
to Stalin with the picture...
Winter of '51, I think...
I started to weep.
I realized then
that I loved this woman.
One of my colleagues saw tears
in my eyes, and he said:
Yuri Rodanovich, what's wrong?
Do you read my letters?
Does anyone read my letters?
Can anyone read my letters?
Is my Russian that bad?
- I don't know. Forgive me.
After that day...
I promised myself
that I would find a way...
to make Stalin read her letters.
Stalin was growing
old now, you see...
and nothing frightened him
like growing old.
He... He had angina,
high blood pressure.
Also, he was very grouchy
from trying to give up smoking.
That was all we needed.
- Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes!
Comrade Khrushchev's memorandum on
the Korean situation, Comrade Secretary.
On my desk.
- Ohh.
What is this mess?
Please forgive me, Comrade Secretary.
Correspondence from Australia.
- I will remove it immediately.
- No.
I need to...
to check up on things in Australia.
Never underestimate
Australians, Yuri.
They're not as silly as they sound.
Leave this with me for a while.
Yuri. Come here.
Closer.
Closer.
Closer!
Have you been smoking?
No, Comrade Secretary.
Who has been smoking?
Punin. Puzyrev. Slepak.
Druchin. Yermolinksy.
Good.
- Aksenov.
- Ah.
- Troepolski. Ezvekov.
- Good.
- Yegorov.
- Yeah.
- Mikhalov.
- Good.
- Troegubov.
- That's enough!
* To keep the red flag flying here **
It's been a great day, Welch.
Great day. Amen.
You know, I've got a bottle of French
champagne I've been saving.
French champagne?
- I do worry about you sometimes, Welch.
- Oh, come on, Joan.
Just live a little.
I won't tell UncleJoe.
Welch...
am I no fun?
What?
Am I no fun to be with?
Don't be silly.
It's just that, you know, I can't relax.
I mean...
It's not something you can do
as a hobby, you know...
have a worker's revolution and overthrow
the current system of government.
It's not like fishing.
No, it's not like fishing, Joan.
I used to fish with my father.
That's how I learned about
the Party and Marx and Lenin.
Fishing with my father.
He taught me all the stories.
He taught me "L'Internationale."
* And the last fight let us face *
* The Internationale *
* Unites the human race *
* So comrades come rall... **
Mmm.
- I'd better go.
- Joan, don't.
Sorry.
- What is it?
- It's late.
Don't just go like that. I mean, you're
not worried what I'll do, are you?
I'm not gonna make you do anything
you don't want to do.
I'm not gonna make you do anything.
You can do whatever you like.
Or not.
Good night, Welch.
Oh, damn.
Stalin spent three days
locked in his office...
poring over theJoan Fraser file.
He was not a fast reader.
* Yuri, Yuri *
* Yuri **
You know, three days ago
I felt like an old man.
Today... I feel like a young woman.
Get me Beria, Malenkov and Khrushchev.
The Three Stooges.
Yuri.
I have a brilliant idea.
Our interests in Joan Fraser
intensified considerably...
when she received
the invitation...
to the 1952 Party Congress in Moscow.
- You can't do this.
- Welch.!
- It's too dangerous.
- Welch, l...
- What can I say?
- Nothing.
- Joan, what if you don't come back?
- Look, I have no ties here.
I'll go where I can best be use...
From each according
to their capacity...
To each according to their needs.
Yeah, I know. I need you.
I love you. I want to marry you.
Oh, Welch. I know.
I don't understand.
Welch...
I've watched you invest
a lot of kindness and energy...
a lot of yourself in loving me.
Not that I've ever encouraged it.
Nobody could say that.
God knows.
I just can't invest everything...
in one person.
You're prepared to invest everything
in Stalin. He's one person.
No, no, no. No, no. Stalin...
Stalin is all of us.
Stalin is our leader, Welch.
It's through him that we all get to...
to achieve our goals.
So it's vicarious, then.
- What?
- That's the best word I know.
Vicarious.
V-I-C-A-R-I-O-U-S.
Felt by sharing in
the experience of another.
Vicarious.
I'm impressed.
I got it wrong in a spelling bee
at school.
My dad gave me the strap for it.
I hope we can still be friends, Welch.
I already have lots of friends, Joan.
Well, that was it for me,
in terms of Communism and Stalin.
I hated the bastard.
I was, uh, sent to look after her.
They'd set me up as an attache
at the Australian Embassy.
Unnecessary, really, since I was already
a lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B.
You're not really surprised,
are you, Joan?
Everyone's doing it.
- Do they know?
- Who?
The Russians.
Of course they know. They organized it.
They run me, as we say.
Of course, I make a little on the side,
here and there.
Tides a fellow through.
Snippets for the Germans; whispers
for the English; that sort of thing.
- And the Australians?
- What about them?
Do they know?
Well, no one really cares if they know.
For the record, most of them do know...
but then most of them are also,
of course, spies for the Russians.
So it doesn't really matter, does it?
Everyone in the embassy here
is a spy, for instance.
Except for that bloke...
What's his name, Ivan?
- Cartwright, I think, Nine.
- Cartwright.
- Nine? Is that what
they call you? Nine?
- Nine.
Jesus Christ. I don't believe this.
If you're with us...
then why did you come and see me
that night and say those things?
Uh, well, um...
In the first place, I'm not really
with you in the way you think I am.
I'm no ideologue.
I'm just a hired spy.
I run with the hounds.
In the second place...
I was checking you out
for the Russians.
In the third place, I was making
an offer on behalf of the Australians.
So, whose hat are you wearing now?
Yes, well, the Australians think
you're a spy for the Russians...
so they want me to kill you.
But the Russians...
The Russians have brought me over
to look after you.
What are you gonna do?
Well, frankly, Joan,
it's a bit of a tangle...
so I'm just having to make things up
as I go along.
Unfortunately,
just before she arrived...
Stalin had caught flu.
That meant that he was
in a terrible fury.
He didn't want to appear
sickly or old to her...
so he asked me to arrange
to keep her busy...
until he got better.
* When you're alone *
Stalin chose that night.
He, uh, he had a shave.
He had a manicure.
He doused himself in cologne.
I remember he used too much.
- Keep pulling! Pull it!
- Everything about him that night...
- Aaagh!
Was shampooed, shined,
perfumed, cut, whatever.
He took three hours to get ready.
- The Three Stooges...
Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev...
had been invited to laugh
at Stalin's jokes...
Iose arguments and tell
great stories about him.
- Stalin wanted to keep
a record of that night...
and I asked Nine to take pictures.
No, no, no.
When, uh, Joan arrived...
the room fell silent.
Dinner was late...
and they drank a great deal
of vodka that night.
And her eyes, ohh.!
And the little...
Stalin spoke with great warmth...
about everything.
The usual recriminations
and vindictiveness ofhis table...
were absent that night.
I always did what I thought best
for my people.
My little pussycats.
What will happen when I'm gone?
What will become of my pussycats?
What will become of us, Comrade Joan?
He even sang.
* I get no kick from champagne *
* Mere alcohol
doesn't thrill me at all *
* So tell me why should it be true *
* Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo That *
* I get a kick out of you **
At about midnight...
they started to watch a film.
- American, as usual.
*It was just one of those things *
Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov
were expected to leave
at five minute intervals.
Which they did, with clockwork precision.
*Just one of those things *
*It was just one of those nights *
*Just one of those fabulous lights *
*A trip to the moon
on gossamer wings *
- *Just one of those things *
- Good night, Yuri.
*lf we'd thought of it
Of the end of it *
* When we started painting the town *
* We'd have been aware *
- * That our love affair *
* Was too hot not to cool down **
Ohhh.
Get me... a doctor.
- Stalin.
You killed...
Joseph Stalin?
Yeah.
Jesus.
Joan, what did you do to him?
I don't know. I don't remember.
I don't... recall.
- I think we were in his room.
- His room?
You were in his... bedroom, Joan?
- You were in his bedroom?
- I think so.
Christ, Joan, the man ran
the Soviet Union. What were
you doing in his bedroom?
I don't remember. I don't recall.
This is serious, Joan.
I mean, they shoot people for excessive
breathing in this country.
There's a cold war on.
He started it, and you're
from the other side!
- I didn't mean to.
- That isn't the point, Joan!
Don't shout.
- Ohhh!
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Shh!
Joan. Joan. Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I killed him.
Oh, stop it, Joan.
You did us all a favor.
How can you say that?
How can I say that?
What we did for that man.
What did you do?
Oh, a bit of this, a bit of that.
Mmm. Systematic genocide.
- Torture. That sort of thing.
- Bullshit.
- I thought you'd be interested
in what we did for UncleJoe.
- Stop it.
- How we roamed through
small Baltic towns.
- Stop it, David!
- How we loaded the locals onto
trucks in the dead of night.
Yes, cunning buggers, though.
Pretending to be
illiterate peasants...
when, of course, they're
all really nuclear physicists
plotting against the state.
I even told her about the couple
from Ogre. I still dream about them.
She was blind.
He'd lost both arms in the war.
But together they made a rather
brilliant accountant, apparently.
I had them shot after they...
after they were denounced
by a neighbor...
for plotting to shoot
a local Party official.
- She didn't believe me.
Ha!
* You're the top *
* You're Mahatma Gandhi *
* You're the top *
* You're Napoleon brandy *
* You're the purple light *
* Of a summer night *
*In Spain *
- Whoo!
- * You're the National Gallery *
* You're Crosby's salary *
* You're cellophane **
I think I should go home.
Joan, it's not too late
to change your mind.
You're not thinking right.
What have you got to go back to?
You can have
anything you want here.
You could work for the Party.
Or not. They don't mind,
as long as you stay here...
with me.
They look so happy.
- How can they look so happy?
They're happy because...
Stalin is dead.
I don't understand.
It doesn't make any sense.
Joan, it's over. He's dead!
- Mmm.
- They're the future.
A million people
came to see his body, David.
A million people,
and they were all crying.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Children were crying.
Old people were crying.
And they look happy.
Will they kill me if I go home?
No, you'll be safe.
I had a word to Beria. He'll give orders
to the head of British Intelligence.
They'll tell the Australians
you're a mole for the Ml6.
Oh.
- Thank you.
Joan.
What more can I say?
Nothing.
- And then...
- She left our lives.
West to southwesterly winds...
West to southwesterly winds...
followed by a cool evening.
Stay tuned now
for our special program...
in which our panel
of eminent historians...
will discuss the life of Joseph Stalin.
Hello.
Can I come in?
Do you want a drink?
You look shocking, Welch.
I'll have one, then.
Did you have a nice trip?
"Nice"? You do know he died?
Went pretty much unnoticed here.
Well, did you get to
meet him before he died?
- No.
- Pity.
Mmm.
- What do you want, Joan?
- I have to ask you a question.
Do you believe, Welch?
I wasn't sure
what that question meant...
but whatever it meant, I knew
I had to tell her whatever
it was she wanted to hear.
- Yes.
- You believe what I believe?
- Yes.
- About the world?
- Yes.
- About Stalin?
Yes.
Welch, I'm pregnant.
Oh. I see.
I really don't know what to say, Joan.
There's no father, Welch.
Joan, I'm not an educated man...
but there are some basic facts
that I do understand.
No, no, I didn't say there was
no father. For God's sake, Welch.
I said there is...
no father.
- Do you understand now?
- No.
I want to offer you the job.
Offer me the job?
Yes.
I want to accept
your proposal of marriage...
if it still stands.
Why? You don't love me, Joan.
Oh, I love you, Welch.
I'm just not in love with you.
Does that matter so much?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it does.
Welch, there's a lot more
at stake here right now...
than love.
It's a bastard of a world out there...
if you know what I mean.
Well, I mean...
you know, if we c...
Christ, I should tell you to go jump.
There's only one thing I ask.
Mmm.
I don't want the child
to know I'm not his father.
Now, Joseph Stalin.
Who was Joseph Stalin?
Anybody?
Joe.
Joseph Stalin was born losif
Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili in 1879...
in the small Georgian town of Gori.
It was in the latter years
ofhis seminary education...
that he started working for the people
in a revolutionary capacity...
against the ruling feudalist
Romanovian monarchy.
I'm sure it's nothing to be
alarmed about, Mrs. Welch...
but yesterday in history class...
when discussing 20th-century
world leaders...
your son, Mrs. Welch,
stumbled over Winston Churchill...
but gave a most breathtakingly
detailed account...
of the life ofJoseph Stalin.
Yes. And?
Whilst the detail was impressive...
your son spoke of Stalin
in a disturbing manner.
In what way, disturbing?
Well, glowingly, I'm afraid.
Now, I'm merely asking out
of sense of concern forJoe...
and I pray you take no offense...
but is there anyone you know
close to the family...
who may be a... Communist?
You don't think that...
I'm afraid I do think,
Mrs. Welch, very strongly...
there is somebody giving your son...
ideas.
"Ideas"?
Oh, God, no.
You've got to be careful
of people like her, Joe.
All your life you'll hear a lot of
things about important people.
- Some of them will be true...
- Some of them won't be.
Most of the time you'll have
no way of knowing whether what
they're telling you is true.
That's why you gotta stand by
what you believe in in your stomach.
You're special, Joe.
You got greatness in you.
You're gonna be able to do a lot
for people 'cause you're bright...
you got a good heart.
Somebody's gotta care
about the future...
and I think if you can find something
you really care about...
you could do something great one day.
Well, if it isn't
public enemy number one.
You been robbing banks again?
That's very naughty.
Hold out your hands.
If this happens again, I'll
see to it that you're charged,
all of you, with abduction.
As for you, young man,
if it does happen again, I
won't be coming to get you.
You can stay in jail and rot.
I don't understand you.
- Where'd you get
this passion for prisons?
Old habits die hard, I see.
How are you, David?
This business or social?
You still in the business?
- Why didn't you tell me, Joan?
- Tell you what?
That you had a child.
Well, I didn't think
you'd be very interested.
I wasn't, until I found out
his birthday.
What can I do for you, Dave?
Is he mine?
Who?
Oh, come on, Joan.
You have a child.
Nine months before he was born,
you slept with Stalin,
and you slept with me.
I don't recall you and I ever
sleeping together, David.
- Yes, we did.
- Run us a bath, mate.
My feet are killing me.
- Hello.
Oh, hi, doll.
- G'day. I'm Joan's husband.
- Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
Um, this is my husband Welch,
and this is N... David.
David Hoyle.
David Hoyle.
And this is my... our son Joe.
This is Mr. Hoyle.
- How are you, Joe?
- Good.
- Oh. David's an old friend.
- From Moscow.
Oh, from Moscow, eh?
It's good to meet you.
- Would you like to stay for dinner?
- Oh, I'm sure David...
That'd be great. Thanks.
- It wasn't him.
- I don't want to be protected.
If you want to... change anything...
i-in the house, i-if you feel...
It wasn't him. I promise.
The fellow who it was is dead.
He died shortly after, actually.
He won't be back.
Okay?
I don't want to change
anything in this house.
Just the rest of the world, huh?
That's right.
"Behold...
"I was brought forth in iniquity...
"and in sin did my mother
conceive me.
"Purge me with hyssop,
and I shall be clean, :
Wash me and I shall be
whiter than snow."
That's good. What's it called?
It's called "The Hangman's Psalm."
You know, it's funny, Joe... I've never
thought of execution as a hobby before.
What do you wanna do
when you grow up, Joe?
I don't know.
What do you like to do?
I like to go to jail.
- Do you?
- Yeah. It's good fun.
"Good fun." Yeah.
To go to jail
you have to commit a crime.
Mom says it's all right to commit
a crime of political "conchness."
Wh-What's a crime of
political "conchness"?
I think it's about time
for bed for you, son.
Hey, Welch, what do you say us fellas go
out and have some fun, the three of us?
Maybe catch a game or something.
- Yeah!
He seemed to be able
to get us into things.
If there was a show we wanted to see
and couldn't get tickets...
or the footy, whatever...
Dave would come through.
Sometimes he'd just ring
and we'd go for a beer.
He was very kind toJoe.
Uh, I suppose he became a mate.
I haven't stopped loving you, Joan.
Look...
I know that, despite yourself,
you're happy...
even if the world is still as rotten
as it was nine years ago.
I know you've found something.
I don't want to take that
away from you, but...
if I could just have
some small part of it...
if I could just helpJoe
along the way...
He has a father.
He has more than one father, Joan.
Oh, this is crazy.
Oh, it's hard enough without this.
- "Hard"?
All this time I've thought
of nothing but you...
being near you and resisting
the one thing in the world...
that could make me happy.
Then I come home and find this.
And you think you've got it hard.
I can't work, David.
It has to.
By the way, just changing
the subject completely...
did I ever show you those shots
I took of you in Moscow?
I don't respond well to threats.
Whatever do you mean?
*Evil child *
*Evil child *
*I know you well and if you
wanna stay that's all right *
* You want me again *
*A-And you'll come to me *
* Well *
* Well, th-th-that's all right *
* That's all right *
* That's all right *
*Now she's gone *
*She's walkin'away *
*Red dress on *
*And long black hair **
Are you ready, love?
We're late.
Okay. It'll be over in a minute.
And how many young men
do you think are gonna die
in Vietnam in that minute?
- I really don't understand you
sometimes, Joe.
- Mom, what are you doing?
- How was that meant to be a comedy?
And who is this Maxwell Smart person?
Some idiot American spy
who runs around...
after idiot Eastern European spies
who you can always tell...
because they're the ones
in black leather coats
and funny German accents...
so that in the minds
of our children, the people
of Socialist Eastern Europe...
become redefined
as marginalized Nazis.
It's just a television show!
- Bloody crap!
- It's what kids watch.
- There's a war on, you know.
- Christ, I didn't start it.
- Don't you want to stop it?
- Who's for a cuppa?
- Don't you?
I...
I just want it to stop. Okay?
I don't... I don't care who
does the actual stopping.
I mean, it's not important
who stops it, is it?
Are you saying you don't want
to come to the rally with me?
You've always been happy
to march before.
I mean, since you were a baby.
You were marching
before you could walk.
Oh, come on, darling. Come on.
Come to the rally.
- Oh, go on with your mum.
* Well, you can bump and grind *
- Bastard!
- Pig!
- *lf it's good for your mind *
- Pig!
* Well, you can twist and shout *
*Let it all hang out *
*But you won't fool *
* The children of the revolution *
*No, you won't fool *
* The children of the revolution *
*No, no, no **
... erupted all over the country today...
As demonstrations against Australian
involvement in Vietnam...
- were held in each capital city.
- Hello? Hello?
- Yeah.
- Universities closed down...
- I had a funny f...
- and streets were blocked...
- as tens of thousands...
- I can be there in ten minutes.
- Bye-bye.
- Speaking in Melbourne...
Dr. Jim Cairns called the rallies
a huge success.
* So away with all your superstitions *
*Servile masses arise, arise *
* We'll change forthwith
the old conditions *
*And spurn the dust to win the prize *
*So, comrades come rally *
*And the last fight let us face *
- * The Internationale *
- Thanks, mate.
- * Unites the human race *
- Mr. Welch. Here we are again.
* So, comrades come rally *
- All right, quieten down...
- * And the last fight *
- comrades.
- * Let us face **
Shut up!
Oh, come on, Welch. It was funny.
And what's up with you?
- Your selfishness is what's up with me.
- My selfishness?
Has it ever occurred to you
that we do what we do because
we want to help other people?
Has it ever occurred to you
that people close to you
might worry about you...
when you're out doing things
you believe might help
people you don't even know?
*Honey, hi *
Turn around, please.
*Honey, ho *
*How are you *
* You all right *
*Hey, I could fix you up *
* Well, come on
let's see what we can do *
* Come on, shake *
* Come on, squeeze it *
*Like you do *
* Uh-huh *
* Oh, baby, yeah *
- *It can kill a man *
*Lovin'things like you can do *
* Oh, oh, honey, hi *
- * Ohh, honey, oh **
- Oww!
Joe, there's a letter for you...
from the army.
You right, love?
It's time, Welch.
I can't go with you, doll. I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on, love.
- I can't, Joan.
I'll say good-bye here.
I've called Dave. He's better
with these things than me.
I want to state clearly that...
l-I have conscientious objections
to the war in Vietnam.
As it is now after midnight,
I'm in violation of the
National Services Act of 1970.
I see. Well, in that case, Mr. Welch,
you're under arrest.
Ohh! Bloody fascists!
Isn't the blood of our youth
enough for...
- Oh! This is brutality!
You bastards!
- That's it, love.
Give 'em as good as you get!
You all right, constable?
Yes, thank you.
- I have to go to prison.
- I know.
Will you wait for me?
What does that mean?
It means "I love you"...
in Latvian.
Yes, it was strange
and rather perverse...
but...
that's love for you, isn't it?
Have you ever read The Inferno?
- No.
- You should.
It's always a comfort to know
that a worse hell exists.
I'd borrowed a paltry sum...
from one of our family companies...
and fully intended to repay
the loan with interest.
But when my sister,
who is quite mad...
and who was sleeping with
our accountant at the time...
found out about the loan...
which was all above board...
she concocted this ridiculous
embezzlement story about me...
the tragic result of which
was, of course...
my unjust imprisonment.
Joe didn't strike me as exceptional.
When I first met him
there were many in prison...
who seemed, at a glance,
more exceptional than Joe.
- Colin Slansky, for one...
who, funnily enough,
had quite a passion for history...
as everyone found out on their arrival.
This is my wing.
This is my Paris, my Rome, my Athens.
This is my fuckin' fortress...
from which my empire spreads.
But Joe only had
one thing on his mind...
apart from avoiding Colin, of course...
and I can assure you
it wasn't revolution.
* Come on, baby *
- *Let's lay down here *
*And make love *
* Come on, baby *
- *Let's lay down here *
- *And make love *
Hey!
*Because the moon is full *
*And the stars are out *
- *And what we know
is what it's all about **
- She'll wait.
I mean, I said she didn't have to wait.
She said she wanted to wait.
So she'll wait, right?
I...
trust her.
19 Rawson Street, Surry Hills.
You got it?
Yeah.
So you want me to...
keep an eye on her?
Yeah, but... but from a distance, okay?
I don't want her to think
I'm spying on her or anything.
I just want to make sure
that nobody's bothering her.
Yeah, okay, Joe.
I hate asking you to do this.
It's no problem.
Believe me.
You should know, I'm a cop.
I know you're a cop, Anna.
Do you know what I am?
I'm Joe's father.
In between confrontations
with Colin and fretting about Anna...
he'd talk about his family.
Your mother is aware of what Stalin did,
exactly, isn't she?
My mother thinks that Western historians
and Soviet counterrevolutionaries...
conceived propaganda about Stalin
in order to undermine the...
- She couldn't be right, could she?
- No.
I mean, he-he killed lot of people.
- Yep.
- Thousands.
- Millions.
- Millions?
Not millions. Where's it say millions?
He started reading
like a man possessed.
Read everything there was on Stalin, :
Then the Soviet Union, :
Europe, : Philosophical works
on the nature of power.
He was insatiable.
Mum, I have to ask you this:
What exactly is your current
opinion ofJoseph Stalin?
Stalin?
He built the Soviet Union into the
only effective and sustainable...
truly equitable
socialist society in the world.
- Why do you ask?
- You do... You do recognize
that he did a lot of bad stuff?
- At least acknowledge that.
- We've been through this, Joe.
- Look, I've been doing a lot of reading.
- Don't tell me.
Wilf is an historian, Mum.
It's a lot worse than...
Wilf is a petty thief, peddling
his own brand of historical
distortion for a dollar.
But Stalin is still a murdering thug.
- According to whom, exactly?
- According to everybody!
- It's a matter of historical record.
- But whose historical record?
The historical record of
the international media cartels
whose sole aim...
What if I told you he was a paranoid
butcher and a despot?
- Is to control all human beings?
- What if l...
What if I told you he was your father?
It's time, mate.
Ooh. I'm s... I'm sorry, l...
l-I didn't, um...
- Is this you?
- No, that's my mother with her parents.
You're kidding. I would have
sworn it was you.
I know this bridge. Is this Tasmania?
No.
Well, where is it?
You would never have been there.
- Well, I might well have been there.
- Oh, really?
Well, have you ever been to Latvia?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I have been to Latvia.
Well, all right, have you
ever been to a town called Ogre?
There's a better one there.
Come on, David. I bet you haven't.
Um, no, you're right.
It must be... somewhere similar.
I remember Joe as very quiet...
when he came back from seeing
his mother that day.
Well, what are you fuckin' lookin' at?
It was one of those
intimidating quiets...
the sort of quiet
you don't meddle with.
- Unless, of course, you're a psychopath.
- Who are you to...
Shut the fuck up!
Fifty thousand prison cells
in the country...
and I have to get the one
next to the only fat bastard...
who's more psychotic than my mother
when it comes to history!
You haven't met my mother. She could
teach you a thing or two about history.
If what she tells me
is true, Col, you just...
you don't find genetic stock more wicked
and depraved than mine.
- You understand?
- He'd had enough.
Let's be quite clear about this:
Joe made his first
political decision that day.
He decided to change a world
he didn't much care for.
They-They-They tried everything to make
him eat, but they couldn't break him.
So as a last resort,
they tried something...
rather macabre and barbaric...
known in prison circles
as "the pork sword."
Bacon.! Bacon.! Bacon.! Bacon.! Bacon.! Bacon.!
Well, they wanted to break Joe...
but it wasn'tJoe that broke that day.
Open all the doors.!
It wasn't that serious a fire.
I really didn't understand the urgency
of the evacuation until months later...
when the inquiry found that the
heating system in our wing...
- hadn't been serviced since 1947.
Of course, Joe didn't know this when
he went back to rescue Barry Rogers...
a guard who'd been injured
during the evacuation.
Welch is reported to have suffered burns
to 50 percent of his body...
but is in a stable condition.
Prison officers are already hailing
the conscientious objector as a hero...
and the attorney general has
announced plans to pardon Welch...
who will return to his family
a free man after his recovery.
Coming up after the break:
Pensioners picket
the tax department, :
Police Minister Porter
named Father of the Year, :
And the cat they thought
couldn't, but could after all.
- I didn't say he was your father.
- That is what...
No, I said, "What if I told you
he was your father?"
- What's the difference?
- It's all the difference in the world!
I was making a point. It was irony.
For God's sake, I didn't say it
as if I meant it.
Hello, Mrs. Welch.
- Do I know you?
- Well, yeah.
I've arrested you a couple of times.
This is unbelievable. I've heard of
harassment, but this is ridiculous.
- No. Mum.
- My son is a hero of the state.
Mum, no. This-This is Anna.
We're getting married.
Dad, this is Anna.
Anna, Dad.
How do you do, dear?
- Oh, I've gotta go. I'm gonna be late.
- Be careful.
- I will.
What's wrong?
I know this is not the right
time to ask this, Joe...
but that man that was in this room
with us tonight...
- That-that man is your father?
- Yeah.
- Hello?
- Mum?
- Oh, I'm glad you called.
- Mum...
- Your father's worried sick
about this marriage business.
- Mum...
Frankly, it wouldn't
surprise either of us, Joe...
Mum, David's been visiting
Anna while I was away.
He told her he was my father.
I know you're in there.
Come on, open up, David.!
... wonder why I'm wearing this striped mask.
It's a disguise
to protect you from
the Forensic Meat Squadron.
Wake up. Wake up!
David!
You stupid bastard!
Wake up!
Dear Anna, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean
to deceive you like this...
but I so loved our time together.
- Do you mind?
- Sorry, madam.
To my eternal regret...
pretending to beJoe's father
wasn't my only deception.
I was the K.G.B. Officer responsible
for the liquidation of Ogre.
Your grandparents were shot
in a camp in Novgorod...
about a month after we arrested them.
Excuse me. He is going
to be all right, isn't he?
- You did say that, didn't you?
- He'll be fine.
- Sorry, Sergeant. I got caught up.
- That's okay.
Listen, we found this bloke naked.
We haven't been able to get
much out of the old girl.
- Um, can I have a word?
- See what you can do.
Thanks.
I know how this must look,
but I can assure you,
absolutely nothing's going on.
It doesn't look like anything to me,
Mrs. Welch.
They, um... They told me he was naked.
Yes, well, that's how I found him,
um, obviously.
Is David Joe's father?
- No.
- Right.
- Constable?
- What's up?
- We found some photos in the bedroom.
- Mm-hmm?
- I think she's in them.
- I'll handle this, Sergeant.
Family friend.
- Okay.
- Mrs. Welch, would you
come in for a sec, please?
The boys found these.
Excuse me.
- So?
- So, is it a problem?
Y-You know, if-if-if
we keep the photos?
No. No real problem.
But, um...
if it, uh...
if it...
Welch...
You see, is very protective.
I don't think he'd like
to know that this was, uh...
- Oh, I know exactly what you mean.
- So what do you want from me?
Mrs. Welch, I love your son,
and he loves you.
So I'll help you because it'll help him.
That's all there is to it.
I just want us...
to be a normal, happy family.
Isn't that what you want?
- Yes.
- Good.
Then there's no problem.
L-I checked out of hospital that night.
Couldn't face anyone,
especially the Welches and Anna.
I'd also embarrassed my employers...
in a way that wasn't
necessarily good for my health.
It was time to disappear for good.
* Gonna see my baby tonight *
* Gonna see my baby tonight *
* Wanna tell ya she's outta sight *
*Loves me in the mornin'*
*Loves me late at night *
*Doo-doo-mmm Doo-doo-doo *
*Doo-doo-mmm Doo-doo-doo **
Good, good.
The nose has worked very nicely.
Very nicely.
Mmm.
If someone really wanted
to find fault...
the lip may be something.
But, as I say, only if someone
really wanted to find fault.
On the other hand, of course,
I've always admired a man
with a good moustache.
What's everybody looking at?
Oh, nothing.
This year's Hastings Medal...
for outstanding service
to the prison community...
goes, for the first time,
to a former inmate, Joe Welch.
Uh, I remember when I was
about six, I think...
my mother and I were arrested.
Uh, well, Mum was arrested. I was
probably just loitering with intent.
Uh, so, although my interest...
in the-the conditions of the prison
community ha-has, uh...
It's clear to me that for the majority
of you, this isn't just a job.
It's a contribution.
It's-It's-It's something you believe in
in your stomachs...
and that's possibly
the most important thing...
I'm afraid that good intentions
aren't enough anymore.
If-lf you want the right thing
to happen, you have to adapt.
You have to acquire the weaponry
to make it happen, or you will perish.
Now, I'm no expert when it comes
to industrial relations...
but I can recognize an injustice.
And the word that springs to these...
none too tremulous lips
this evening, my comrades...
is strike!
- Strike!
- Yes!
- Strike!
That was great, sweetheart.
- Good on you, boy. I'm proud of you.
- Barry.
- Good on you, Joe.
Hey, some of the boys'd like to have
a word. You know, you're a natural.
Well, they offered Joe thejob as
prison officers'spokesman that night.
He was very popular with the media then
because of the fire...
and he knew everything there
was to know about prisons.
Solidarity.
The government has to
understand that we...
I insist, in the administration
of justice...
All I can say at this time
is that talks are proceeding.
*But underneath this *
* There is a secret *
* That nobody *
* Can reveal *
l-I look back on Joe's years
with the prison officers
as our best years...
- *Look at the world *
- moustache notwithstanding.
*And the state that it's in today *
*I am sure *
* You'll agree *
* We all could make it a better way *
- * With our love **
- Joe, we've been watching you.
We want you to head a new
super law enforcement union...
for police and prison officers.
Now just think what you could achieve...
if you had the power of the
nation's police behind you.
Joe Welch was elected president
today of the new super union...
the Law Enforcement Alliance.
- You are joking.
- Love, come on, don't.
It's Joe's birthday.
- Anna's prepared a beautiful meal.
- You don't think I should?
Well, of course I don't think
you should do it, darling.
Semi-alienated prison officers are bad
enough, but these guys are the police.
You want to work for the police, fine.
- Be a class traitor.
- Joan.
- No, Welch, I wanna be heard.
- Isn't the point to help people?
- Well, people, yes; not the police.
- Oh, excuse me!
So what's your point?
Well, I mean, y-you're getting in way
too deep with the wrong crowd, Joe.
You do that, you turn your back
on me and the Party.
The Party. I can't turn my back on the
Party, because there isn't any Party.
- You tell me what's left of the Party.
- What are you talking about?
Who goes to the meetings? You and Dad,
who sleeps through them anyway.
How would you know
what goes on in the Party?
May; uh, Bren; Tom Booth;
the Pike twins and their cat...
which they probably bring
to make up a quorum.
- The Party is dead.
- Not while I'm alive, it isn't.
Oh, for God's sake, if
you still genuinely believe...
that the revolution is coming
to Australia, and that everyone
on Bondi Beach is gonna get up...
shake the sand off their towels,
pull on their berets
and storm the opera house...
with the greatest respect, Mum,
you're either mad or stupid!
- And I know you're not stupid.
- That's enough, Joe.
Well, I'd better go, then.
You don't want somebody mad
hanging around, do you?
I might shit in the corner
or something, mightn't I?
Well, Joe was very smart.
First thing he did was win the
confidence of the rank and file...
by getting them what they really wanted:
More money and better conditions.
Well, they loved joe after that.
- The L.E.A. Is about
more than wage claims.
- That's funny.
Because I hear the L.E.A.'s first strike
will be over exactly that: Wages.
I wish you wouldn't put it
in such a nuclear way, Paul.
First strike?
You make me sound like Stalin.
- Or somebody.
So when he came up with his plan
to restructure the force...
a plan which gave him even more power,
98 percent of police were for it...
because it was Joe's plan.
Annie?
Look at me.
I had to admit it.
Um, Joe reminded me of Stalin,
which was a problem...
because Stalin
killed my grandparents.
- These are last year's figures.
These are the year before.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And these are the forward projections.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Barry, do I remind you of anyone?
- No.
- Okay.
Barry, out of these three...
who do you think I look most like?
Look at me.
I feel sick.
I feel sick.
He started a sort of crusade,
you see.
He developed what he called
a moral agenda for the police.
The thing was, he was the one
who determined the agenda...
Minister, I have a warrant
for your arrest on 12 counts
of obstruction of justice.
Irrespective of what the government
or the commissioner had in mind.
Welch's statement detailed
the former minister's...
attempts to pervert
the course of justice.
Welch also told the court that this case
was only the tip of the iceberg...
and that the government
had better be ready to confess
to the Australian people...
or face the consequences.
What you must remember is that
the public never knew that
the government had lost control.
The law was being
more effectively enforced...
if anything, as far as
the public was concerned...
becauseJoe Welch was having politicians
arrested on corruption charges...
left, right and center.
It wasn't a-an easy time
forJoe orJoan.
She didn't want to say... wouldn't have
a bar of him, really, for a while there.
So she tried to put all of her energies
back into the revolution.
Uh, it wasn't a good time
for that either.
Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in a wind
squall several minutes early...
and advised his questioners that
they'd have to wait for answers...
forewarning, perhaps, of the news
blackout that was to come.
- His American hosts...
- I can't believe this.
The man's nothing
but a walking birthmark...
trying to pass itself off
as a human being.
Bastard calls himself a Communist!
Gorbachev wouldn't know
his proletariat from his asshole.
You mark my words,
if they don't get rid of him soon...
they'll be eating Big Macs
in Red Square come May Day.
And that'll be it, Welch.
I mean, a little reform's one thing.
God knows, we all have to adapt.
But McDonald's in Red Square?
It's the end of civilization as we know
it. It's the Communist apocalypse.!
And it's how I always feared it'd
happen. The Devil doesn't carry a gun.
The Devil carries fast food,
cheap appliances and bad television.
You look closely, Welch.
Take off his wig and his makeup.
Gorbachev is Ronald McDonald.
And Ronald McDonald's the Devil!
Welcome to McSocialism. Like some
fries to go with your revolution?
Thanks, love.
- Yes?
- Joe?
There's something
I think you ought to know.
Uh, I'm sorry, Barry.
Didn't I ask to see you?
Yeah, but I think you'll
want to know about this.
I think that what I have to ask you
is important, Barry.
Could you read that piece
of paper for me, please?
Why was this piece of paper
in the rubbish?
I found this piece of paper,
going through the rubbish!
- Why were you going
through the rubbish, Joe?
- Because I was...
l-I will tell you why I was
going through the rubbish.
Because you-you-you can...
you can discover...
a lot about an organization
from its rubbish, Barry!
And finding-finding pieces of paper
like this one in the rubbish...
says a lot about
this organization, Barry!
It says sloppy, Barry.
It says careless, Barry.
It says, your days are numbered,
you stupid fuck.!
- And do you know why?
- Why, Joe?
B-Because...
The prime minister replied that
the only poll that counted...
was the one on election day.
Police are still trying
to determine the cause...
of an accident in Sydney's west
this morning...
that took the life of L.E.A.
Leadership candidate Barry Rogers.
Witnesses claim that Rogers's
station wagon ran out of control...
and plunged several meters
down an embankment
before hitting boulders below.
Well, that was it for me.
And it didn't matter whetherJoe
had actually done it or not.
It didn't even matter anymore
whether or notJoe was Stalin's son.
You see, for me he was.
I took quite a few Valium...
not enough.
I thought, um...
I thought I'd better leave a note.
I wanted to explain toJoe why.
I didn't want to blame him.
But the thing was,
I couldn't stop writing.
I kept-kept writing and writing
and writing and writing.
Itjust all poured out. It was like...
It was like I'd had
this guilt or this...
family curse.
By writing down my confession...
I started to feel absolved.
I felt purged.
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
This is very interesting, Anna.
This is an amazing story.
You've got a best-seller here.
You've photos of my mother dancing
with Joseph Stalin, you say.
- And you didn't tell me.
- I made a promise.
Yes. To me.
You made a promise to me.
I was marrying you.
- You meant to love me then.
- That's why I didn't tell you.
You've lied to me from the beginning.
So has my mother. So has...
So has my... So has Welch.
- Welch doesn't know.
- Bullshit!
Bullshit! No more bullshit!
What do you people take me for?
Joe, listen, I don't know
for sure that it's true.
It's-It's... It's just a feeling!
A feeling.
Well, don't let your feelings...
get in my way, Anna.
And the colossus of Communism
has finally given way...
after three days of effort.
The ten-meter statue of Lenin
has resisted strenuous attempts
to bring it down...
but it finally fell
before the will of the people.
Its fate now? What else?
It will be either auctioned
or sold for scrap.
- What do you want?
- I thinkJoe's trying to kill me.
It's not so bad
being my son, is it?
What do you think?
- I thought I was doing what
was best for the revolution.
- Bullshit.
You're a petty thief
who was obsessed with power.
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Anything you ever got, you stole.
- You could only keep it by murder.
- I get your point.
My mother loved you.
Your mother.
Wow. You know?
It's people like your mother...
That's the worst part.
She believed.
I know.
- What made you you?
- I don't know.
- How does someone become a monster?
- I don't know.
I mean, it can't just be as simple as
poverty and child abuse, can it?
I don't know!
Maybe it is just...
something in us.
Something we're born with?
Joe, it's the prime minister
again. I think you'd better take it.
Yes. Right.
He's sick.!
- I'm not listening to any more of this.
- Joan.!
No. No wonder he's sick, after all
this shit you've been telling him.
It's not shit, Joan. I've seen
the photographs, remember?
- He's dangerous.
- Oh, he's dangerous?
He's not the one chasing me around
my living room like a bloody pit bull!
- He's your son!
- Oh, thank you.
I've been wondering how long it'd take
you to finally grasp that concept;
how long it'd take you to
finally understand the meaning
of the word "loyalty"!
I've wondered the same thing about you,
Joan, and the word "genocide."
All these years of marriage...
now he decides to kill you.
How, in God's name,
could a son of mine...
be so slow?
- Probably his father's influence.
Jesus... Christ!
Why don't you like me, Joan?
Oh, I don't know.
Probably some mother-in-law,
daughter-in-law thing.
I think we're probably
pretty normal, really.
We'll just go on in quiet loathing.
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- But I have, you know.
Worried about it, that is.
I've hated you for that because
I'm really a bloody nice person.
If only you'd given me a chance.
Most people have never
done much for me.
To tell you the truth...
they irritate me.
I'd rather spend an hour
with an interesting shit...
than a minute with
a "bloody nice person."
Was Stalin an interesting shit?
- None of your business.
- Oh, it is now, Joan.
All right.
Anna.
I'm gonna give you a present,
something to remember me by.
I killed...
Joseph Stalin.
Bastard.
So what's it to be, Mummy?
An ambush or a reunion?
What did you really
expect me to do?
Tell you?
When would have been the right time
to tell you that?
Well...
there it is, then.
Gee, and I thought
this was gonna be tough.
It wasn't meant to be like this, Joe.
No.
Maybe this is exactly
how it was meant to be.
Even with the best will in the world...
all Dr. Frankenstein
ended up with was a monster.
Same thing happened to Karl Marx.
What...
What do you expect
to achieve with all this?
The revolution.
The revolution?
This isn't the revolution
I was talking about.
No, but you were talking shit.
All very well to sit
in your house in Balmain and
live off your dead parents...
and Welch's sweat...
- Don't. Don't, Joe.
- And have the comrades
around for dinner parties...
- and sing songs in Russian and
march and whinge and talk...
- Stop it.
- And talk and talk and talk
and talk and talk and talk...
- Oh, shut up, Joe!
- It's not the way!
- Well, stop me.
Joe, they'll kill you.
So?
It's not my life anymore.
It never has been.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
What is it, love?
He's...
He's making a big mistake.
They'll kill him if I don't stop it.
Who will? What are you talking about?
But to stop it...
I have to tell them.
If I have to tell them...
it means I have to tell you.
Tell me what?
I slept with Stalin.
Oh, that can't...
Fucking bastard.
It can't!
You know, I knew it.
I knew it all along!
The fucking, shitting... fucking...
You bastard!
All these years I denied it. I thought
it was just me being stupid or jealous.
But in the pit of my stomach I knew!
I just fucking knew!
The way you talked about him
before you left...
and the way you didn't talk
about him when you came back...
I'm gonna be sick.
Comrades of the press...
my name is Joan Welch.
I am Joe Welch's mother.
It was a godsend.
His credibility was shot overnight.
It didn't matter whether
what she said was true or not...
because it meant the press was going to
ask a lot of tricky questions.
Joe Welch was history.
Dear Joan, I don't think
you've ever really understood...
how I've loved you.
I don't think you've ever really
understood how much I love our family.
I also don't think you know I voted
for Menzies and his mob...
ever since you went to Russia
to see Stalin.
It has long been my contention...
that Joe Welch is
the son of Joseph Stalin.
In my past professional
dealings with Joe Welch...
he has had cause
to confess this to me.
Now, I am not at liberty
to say any more at this point...
pending my forthcoming biography
of Joe Welch, Child of the Revolution.
Thank you.
I just can't see how things
could continue to be as they've been...
and I don't see how I can live
with the differences.
I feel beaten...
not by you orJoe or even myself...
but by Stalin.
My victory of the last 30 years
has been so false...
and his victory over me so complete...
It's so complete that now,
when I look at the two people
I love most in the world...
I can only see
that bastard laughing at me.
My greatest fear has always been a life
without you and Joe...
and I guess it's now time
to face that fear.
All my love...
Your husband...
Zachary Welch.
"Behold...
"I was brought forth in iniquity.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Stalin!
"And in sin did my mother conceive me.
"Purge me with hyssop,
and I shall be clean;
"Wash me...
and I shall be whiter than snow."
* What will you do
when the war is over *
* Tender comrade *
* When we lay down
our weary guns *
* When we return home
to our wives and families *
*And look into the eyes of our sons *
* What will you say
of the bond we had *
* Tender comrade *
It was confirmed that, while serving a
sentenceas a conscientious objector...
against the war in Vietnam...
Welch and his mother's assassin
shared neighboring cells.
I've already spoken today
with several former prison officers...
who claim thatJoe Welch and Colin
Slansky spent much time together.
*And cursed our fathers **
He killed his mother in an attempt
to garner public sympathy...
and deflect attention
from his own corruption.
I don't believe it for a second.
I know he couldn't have killed Joan.
Joe is my son.
Well, the question of a blood test,
we've certainly discussed it.
But things, you see...
We just want to get on with our
own lives now, don't we, darling?
We'll do what we can forJoe,
because we believe in his innocence.
- But...
- Daddy, carry.
David and Andrea and I have to
get on with our own lives now.
Did you plan your mother's murder, Joe?
No.
Did you love your mother?
Yes.
Do you love Anna?
Yes.
Do you love your father?
Yes.
Who is your father, Joe?
My publisher has advised me
not to answer that question.
The incredible thing about it
is how close we came.
* Yeah *
* Well, you can bump and grind *

* Well, you can twist and shout *
