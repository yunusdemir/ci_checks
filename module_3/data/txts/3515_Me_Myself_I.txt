my boyfriend Jared and have...
four kids.
I want to get married and that,
but like not straight away.
Settle down with a guy,
and then have a family.
To be honest, I don't want
to get married whatsoever.
Getting married and having children--
definitely yes-- but not too early.
But I don't recommend you leave it too
late, 'cause you should see my auntie.
She's so desperate.
That's a no. That's a no. That's
a maybe, but I think it'll be a no.
Green Oaks High says tomorrow's no good.
Try ringing back next year.
The personal growth teacher
at North Hills canceled.
Presbyterian Grammar School
banned you...
since that piece you did on
their Year Eight drug dealers.
Your dry cleaning's ready to be
picked up, and your mother called.
Shit!
Shit!
- Another bloody award.
- What for?
Your teen suicide number.
Tedious, isn't it?
You must have enough paperweights
to sink a ship by now.
Jesus, Pam...
You're not still researching
that story on girls, are you?
- I know, I know, deadline's looming!
- Second deadline.
- Is that all?
- Actually, no.
If it's Joe's domestic violence story,
I'm going through it with him tomorrow.
No, it's not that.
It's something else.
Well?
- I don't quite know how to put this.
- Haven't got all day, Max.
Well, actually, it's not just me.
It's the whole office.
There's something--
Look, I know I've been
a real pain in the butt lately...
but it's been 17 1/2 days, and I'm not
going to take up smoking again...
just to make your life easier.
It's just that the girls want to know

<i>Happy birthday, love.
I love and approve of myself.
I love and approve of myself.
I love and approve of myself.
I am in the rhythm and fow
of ever-changing life.
I deserve the best,
and I accept the best.
Where are you?
Yes!
Hi.
Hi!
I guess I could go
to nightclubs, discos...
but, well, I mean,
if I was a decent kind of lady...
sitting there,
minding my own business...
and a man like me came up and tried
to strike up a conversation, well--
I'd think I was a sleaze.
So, I certainly don't think
there's anything wrong...
with people, you know,
making use of personal advertisements.
And I absolutely can't see that there's
anything to be ashamed of about that.
Can you? I mean,
it's not like we're freaks.
It's not like we're
social retards, no.
We're just intelligent,
mature people trying to...
take our destinies
into our own hands.
Right?
Bastard. Coward.
Misogynist. Commitmophobe.
Dental surgeon.
Mr. Right.
Oh, Robert Dickson.
Why did I let you go?
I mean, God, Terri,
I was going to be so successful.
What do you mean? You are!
I've completely fucked up.
You were so lucky to meet Leonard.
You've got a gorgeous husband,
a fantastic marriage...
and now, to top it all off,
uou've got Otto.
- You're disgustingly happy.
- Oh, well, I'm so sorry.
Anyway, what's happy?
You know where it comes from?
In here, attitude.
That's easy to say
when you're happy.
- I think I've missed the boat.
- Rubbish.
I'm thinking
about having a baby...
by myself if I have to.
- I thought you didn't like kids.
- What's that got to do with it?
Oh, pooh!
- It's different when they arrive.
- Come on, Mr. Pooh.
I like Otto.
I'm supposed to be happily married
with two kids by now.
- Says who?
- A clairvoyant.
When did you see
a clairvoyant?
Ages ago, after I decided
not to marry Robert.
You don't seriously still think
about Robert Dickson, do you?
- How many years are we talking, 10, 12?
- Thirteen.
Whatever happened to Dicko?
He ended up marrying
Janine Lititski.
Anyway, this clairvoyant said
move on, don't look back...
and I'd meet a wonderful man and have
two great kids by the time I was--
By now.
One more time! Hold on tight
at the back. Okay, ready? Step!
Elbow! Knee!
Now, come on. Let's put something
into it. Show us you mean it. Yell!
Okay, let's go.
Okay, step! Elbow!
Knee!
Come on! Come on! There's no point
in being ladylike about it.
- So, go! Go!
- Go!
Okay. Okay. Now,
let's say that he's got a hold of you.
- What are some of the things you use?
- Kicking.
- Punching?
- Yelling?
Okay, and if he's got you
on the ground, on top of you?
- Scratch his eyes out.
- Pretend to cooperate. Bite his tongue.
- Okay. Anything else?
- Rupture his scrotum.
So, do you think girls get
a fair go in this school?
- What's this for again?
- I write for 'Focal Point'.
I'm researching an article
about girls today--
what they want out of life, dreams,
expectations, obstacles.
Oh, that's good stuff, 'Focal Point'.
Great articles.
- You read it?
- Yeah. I can, you know.
No, I didn't mean--
I just didn't think it was the kind
of thing that a P.E. teacher would--
A P.E. teacher? Oh. No,
this isn't phys-ed. This is Life Skills.
So you're a--
- A student crisis counselor.
- Sorry.
Ben. Ben Monroe.
Pamela Drury.
There was a terrific story
a while back on teen suicide.
Thank you.
- You wrote that?
- I can, you know.
I wish I'd made a copy of it. Do you
reckon I could get hold of a back copy?
Yes, I think so...
if you really want.
- Nearly went that way myself, you know.
- Suicide?
-Journalism.
- Oh.
Investigative, of course.
You know, ask the hard questions.
Expose corruption.
Right all wrongs.
Look, I'm really sorry. I've gotta rush.
I've got a student waiting.
- That's fine.
- If you ever need any help,just--
Well, that would be great.
It's a real hassle getting into schools.
All right. Well--
I'm a bit hard to catch here.
You know, we get
the lot in this place--
You know, eating disorders,
racism, harassment...
assault, drugs...
and a bit of self-mutilation
on a good day.
Hot date, Mr. Monroe?
Reckon you'll get your end in?
<i>- That's what I like about you
<i>-About you
<i>- You hold me tight
<i>- Tight
<i>Tell me I'm the only one
<i>- Wanna come over tonight
- Hello!
Oh, hi, Mum.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Yeah, I'm just in the middle of dinner.
That's all right.
Steak and vegetables.
How are you?
No, not tonight.
I've got work to do.
Mum, I do look after myself.
I do get out. I've seen people.
Do you always have to do this?
Mum, I'm not being sensitive.
Mum, I have not chosen
a solitary lifestyle.
Hi. Ben?
Oh, it's Pamela Drury,
the journalist from this afternoon.
Look. This might sound crazy.
I don't normally do
this type of thing, but...
I was wondering--
please say if this is inappropriate--
but I was wondering if--
Oh, fuck!
He cooks.
Please, God,
don't make him an alcoholic.
<i>When I was young
<i>I never needed
<i>Anyone
<i>And making love was just for fun
<i>Those days are gone
<i>Livin'alone
<i>I think of all the friends I've known
<i>And when I dial the telephone
<i>Nobody's home
<i>All by myself
<i>Don't wanna be
<i>All by myself
<i>Anymore
<i>I took a chance
<i>Sometimes I feel so insecure
<i>Love's so distant and obscure
- Get that in you. You look like death.
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You gotta look after yourself, Pamela.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
Excuse me. I'm conducting a survey.
Do you have a moment?
Doesn't take long. Great.
-Do you live in the inner-city vicinity?
-Yes.
- And are you employed?
- Yes.
Which age group describes you?
- 18 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 35--
- Stop!
- Do you consider yourself to be happy?
- Pardon?
Do you have faith
in our Lord,Jesus Christ?
As a matter of fact,
I am happy.
Happy, happy, happy.
Probably a lot happier than you, you
patronizing little prick. Now piss off!.
Oh, my God!
I didn't see you.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
Am I dead?
Robert Dickson!
This should do the trick.
Stacy's 12 1/2. Douglas is ten.
That was supposed to be it,
then along came Rupert.
- He was a diaphragm baby.
- Rupert?
Rob's great grandfather.
What's your earliest memory?
Tommy Higginbothom
throwing up all over me.
Yes! I still can't bear
the smell of egg mayonnaise.
Let alone eat it.
First period?
Oh, it was a Saturday morning?
Summer.
I was meant to be meeting
the others down at the beach.
- I was only what?
- Twelve.
I thought it was the end
of the world. Mum--
Caught me trying to burn
my underpants in the incinerator.
What did she say?
''You should be pleased
You're becoming a woman.''
- I guess you don't smoke.
- I gave up years ago.
You can't with a family, you know.
Well, tell me about
all the exciting things in your life.
Oh, well, you
must have done so much.
Well--
I--
The kids from school.
Quick!
God! What have you
done to your hair?
Can I have some juice?
You open it, please.
Pamela.
Pamela?
What's for tea?
- Do you know what I want to have?
- Scintillating conversation?
- A broken leg. That'd be so cool.
- I'll give you one, if you like.
With a plaster so everyone
could tag all over, like that Muzza.
Remember? Where we went last year
for Easter? Mum, what was it called?
- Mum, where was it? Mum?
- Katoomba.
Or a broken arm. My right arm so
I wouldn't have to do any schoolwork.
It's cool to go to hospital. I guess you
have to go to the toilet in your bed.
Is it true?
Is it true, Mum? Mum!
- Is what true?
- Do they stick tubes up you?
I don't know.
I've never been to hospital.
You have so! Three times.
For Stacy, me and Rupert, dumbhead!
<i>I'll do it
<i>on national television.
<i>Lisa, I love you very much.
<i>- I was wondering if you will marry me.
<i>- Of course.
<i>Your call could not be connected.
<i>Please check the number
<i>and try again.
<i>Your call could not be connected.
<i>Please check the number--
<i>How about Friday,
<i>the 15th of March?
<i>- Name, please?
- Drury. Initial P.
<i>- Is that B?
- No, P for peculiar.
<i>- What street?
- Barnes Avenue.
<i>There's no listing
<i>under that name.
None? Are you sure? None?
<i>- I'm sorry. There's no listing.
- Could you try again, please?
<i>Hurry up! Hurry up!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
No. Actually, I--
I--
I think I'm going...
to bed.
Mum? If you haven't got
uour period yet...
do you have to use a condom
when you have sex?
Come on, Pamela.
You've gotta wake up.
Wake up.
You're not asleep, are you?
Oh, come on.
Mum?
Oh! Oh, thank God you're there!
Mum, I think I'm going cr--
Oh, yeah. Sorry. It's a bit late.
I know. Mum? Mum, I've--
I th--
The what?
No, they're fine, Mum.
The kids are fine.
No, nothing's wrong, Mum.
It's nothing really.
I just had a nightmare.
Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you. Bye.
Come on, or I'll be late!
<i>What are you doing?
<i>Dad never goes this way.
<i>Oh. Which way does he go?
<i>- The other way, dummy.
<i>- Right.
<i>I don't go to parties, baby
<i>'Cause people tend to freak me out
<i>I want you to listen, work it out
<i>I can hear the words, but
<i>I still don't know what it's all about
- There's no bread or milk.
<i>- You won't see me down--
Yuck! Who's that for?
Me?
Excuse me.
- Big family.
- Two boys and a girl.
Don't you have to pick up Douglas?
And then she just ran at him.
Went face first
into the mud. Crunch!
You could hear his nose
go everywhere, blood spewing.
He had to go to hospital
in the ambulance and everything.
You should have seen it.
It was so excellent.
I need to go to the toilet.
Okay? Let's go.
I'm not finished.
There you go.
I'll just be out here.
- I'm finished!
- Out you come then.
You finished or not?
Shouldn't you be able
to do this yourself?
- Thanks, mate.
- Daddy!
- Hey, tiger! Oh!
- Daddy!
Now let me guess.
Strawberry milk shake
and French fries. Yeah?
Hi.
Look at you.
I'm wrecked.
Stuck in Melbourne for two hours.
Did you get the roof fixed?
- Cup of tea?
- No, thanks.
I've got to look at some plans
before we go out.
Out?
Bit soon for Alzheimer's,
isn't it?
Your birthday dinner, remember?
Oh, and I haven't had a chance
to get you a present yet.
Sorry.
I am in the rhythm and fow
of ever-changing life.
God! Does that thing still fit?
Where's Harriet?
She's late. Isn't she?
- Maybe she's not coming.
- Yes!
Don't tell me
we haven't got a sitter.
Well, Stacy seems
pretty mature for her age.
And I think it's about time
we gave her more responsibility.
I'm so sorry!
Go! Hurry.
Don't worry about the kids. Hi, guys.
Hi, Harriet.
- Hey, we were getting worried.
- Sorry, Terri.
- Baby-sitter.
- Fantastic!
Your hair!
Love it! Less housewifey.
The party's nothing fancy.
I hope you weren't expecting--
Oh, this?
I just felt like wearing it.
Brings back memories, hey?
Cheers.
- How's Otto?
- He's sleeping. Come and have a look.
That's Otto?
I know, but you spend a day
in hospital...
and have your balls chopped off
and see how you feel.
Poor darling.
But he was an animal.
Pamela, happy birthday.
Thanks.
No, it's crap.
The Gold Coast is where-- Hey!
Here's to the birthday girl! Whoa,
look at her. Doesn't she look great?
Many happy returns there, Pammy.
Geoffrey Ballodero!
Come on. Can't a fella
have a little kiss once a year?
- You going to have me up on date rape?
- Hey, you two!
Can we have a cease-fire
for tonight, please?
Happy birthday, Pam.
You look terrific.
Thanks.
- Come on.
-Janine!
You're still friends
with Geoffrey Ballodero!
I can't believe it.
He's exactly the same.
Let's face it. You've never got
a good word for Geoff, so--
- People were meant to improve with age.
- I think that's wine.
Do you ever wonder what would have
happened if we hadn't got married?
- Where would you be now if I'd said no?
- Who knows?
Maybe you would have married
Janine Lititski.
Oh, give me a break! Janine?
Geoff-and-Janine Janine?
Let's do something.
- Hmm?
- Let's go dancing.
- Dancing?
- What about that place we used to go?
- What place?
- You remember. The place with the view.
On the way back to your fat
in Dempster Street.
We'd sit in the car
and talk all night.
Dempster Street?
What century are you in?
Or we could just go down
by the harbor.
Go for a walk and talk.
Why? What do you want
to talk about?
Oh, nothing. I just thought
it would be nice to catch up.
- To what?
- Talk.
At ten dollars an hour?
It's cheaper to talk at home.
Oh, yes.
Oh, come on, Pamela.
Haven't you ever heard of safe sex?
Diaphragm.
Yes!
- ''I sat by the lake.''
- Lake.
- ''I looked at the sky.''
- The sky.
''And as I looked--''
A fly came by.
''A fly went by.
He said, 'Oh, dear.'
I saw him shake.
He shook with fear.''
Get off!. Douglas, move over!
Give me some room!
What are you doing?
I need space, too, see!
You're hogging!
Oh! Douglas,
get out of the car!
Douglas, you are disgusting!
- Mum! Mum!
- Oh, pooh!
Douglas, do you want to die?
- '' Douglas, do you want to die?''
- Mum!
Douglas, could you please
not do that? It's really offensive.
- It wasn't me. It was Brandy.
- Douglas Dickson!
Stop farting, or you'll be spending
the day with your grandmother!
I mean it!
- Good pass to Dickson.
- Dickson to Dickson!
He's gonna spike that line!
Oh, look at the footwork!
- Crunched him to the ground!
- Yes!
- Ooh, he doesn't like it.
- Go, Dad!
Hey, how about a game?
Girls against guys.
But you hate football.
No, I don't! I used to go out
with a professional footballer.
Oh, ages ago.
You know, before--
- Well, at school.
- You don't know how to kick. Here.
Give Mum a go, Douglas.
We'll have a proper game later.
Way to go, Pam!
Oh, and Hentinghouse
is making another goal!
Go, Mum! Go, Mum!
Yes!
- What's that?
- What?
It's the feasibility study
for the Bouvier job.
Will you be long?
I've got a meeting first thing.
I thought the light didn't bother you.
Oh, no, it doesn't.
It's just I--
I--
I feel like reading myself.
- What?
- You were asleep.
No, I wasn't.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Nothing's the matter.
It's just I--
Just what?
Just that I've always loved you.
Since forever.
Where's your ring?
I...
lost it.
- You lost it?
- No, I mean, I didn't lose it. I--
It fell off.
I think I've lost weight.
It's at the jeweler's being resized.
- See ya!
- Thanks for waiting, dickhead!
At what point is it exactly that
uou learn to do this yourself?
Come on, mate. See ya.
Have a nice day, dear.
Bye, Rupert.

What?
''You've had the whirlwind romance
and the fairy tale wedding...
but what's a girl to do
when the honeymoon is over?
Here are ten surefire ways
to keep the magic alive.''
Oh, my God.
Hello?
Hi, Deidre.
Right now? I'm at home.
10:30?
Deidre?
Do you want to talk about it?
I don't think so.
Look, Pam, it's not like you to miss
an issue, so if you're having problems--
No, I'm-- I'm just not sure.
If you could give me an idea.
What's so hard?
The modern woman. Let me see.
Now that guys change the sheets
and leave the toilet seat down...
what do we really want?
Romance. Femininity.
You can do it on your head.
We need this one fast, Pam,
or we'll miss the issue. Friday, okay?
Jules, get meJoe Nathan.
Oh, and, Pam-- Make sure you tie it in
with next season's looks.
Jules will give you the pics.
Joe! Hi.
- Harry.
- G'day, mate.
Christ, some of the rubbish
this place puts out.
Listen. ''You've had the whirlwind
romance and the fairy tale wedding...
but what's a girl to do
when the honeymoon is over?
Here are ten surefire ways
to keep the magic alive.''
Jesus, who writes this crap?
I do.
Good one, mate.
Look, would you believe me
if I said I didn't mean--
Oh, no, you're right.
It is crap.
You're a journalist?
- Who do you write for?
<i>- Speed Weekly.
Features mostly.
<i>Speed-- The sports rag?
Well, that's hardly
investigative journalism.
I always do that.
Look, I was just going
for a caffeine hit.
I was wondering
if you'd like to--
I mean, if you've
got the time.
I don't think so.
I'm Ben, anyway.
Ben Monroe.
I prefer it to ''that arrogant bastard.''
Pamela Dru-- ickson.
Why sport? Didn't you want
to tackle the heavy stuff?
I mean, if you're
gonna be a journalist...
surely there are more important things
to write about...
than this week's groin injury.
What, like cosmetic surgery
or how to please your man?
Actually, I enjoy it most of the time.
Plus I get a lot of free travel, so--
Does your wife mind?
The traveling?
Well, I'd suppose she'd mind
if I had one.
Came close once. A long time ago.
Another life. Sophie.
We were students together.
I was gonna be a schoolteacher,
believe it or not.
Anyway, we were crazy for each other
and nearly did the whole bit.
- Marriage, kids, matching pajamas.
- What happened?
She was hit by a car just before
graduation. Killed instantly.
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
Yeah. Well, I went off the deep end...
chucked teachers' college
and traveled the world.
Just went in another direction.
Do you ever wonder what your life
would be like if--
She was still alive?
Only every day.
There have been others,
but I guess you could say...
that Sophie was the love of my life.
Oh,Jesus. You're good at this.
Good at what?
Well, what are you gonna call it?
'' Men Who Talk Too Much''?
Yes!
My God, what's this?
Nothing much.Just chicken Clementine
braised in a honey sauce...
stuffed with tomatoes and capers...
on a bed of mint rice
garnished with rosemary.
I don't know what it'll be like.
Did you cook this?
Smells funny.
It's edible.
Oh, God, should we get that?
Hello?
Actually, I'm just
in the middle of work...
and I'm really pushing
to make a deadline, so--
Yeah.
No, that's fine.
Yeah, okay, that'll be great.
Speak to you then. Bye.
Who was that?
Why didn't you just tell her
we were bonking?
I need a giraffe.
Hello?
Ah, last night.
No, that's all right.
I was just busy.
Actually, now's not such a great time.
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
I'm not sure.
Look, could I get back to you?
No, I don't.
Speak to you then. Bye.
I gave up years ago.
- What'd you do with my spanner set?
- What spanner set?
The one you gave me, dummy.
I didn't do anything
with your spanner set.
Well, where is it?
I need it.
I don't know.
Have you looked in your room?
It was on the foor under some stuff.
Must've moved it.
I haven't touched your spanner set.
- Bet you did, dumbhead.
- Oh, and, Douglas?
What?
My name's Pamela. Apparently,
you have the right to call me Mum.
But if you ever address me as ''dummy,''
''dumbhead'' or ''stupid'' again...
I guarantee you won't have any trouble
finding your spanner set.
Got it?
Stacy, do you think you could
turn that down a bit?
- What are you doing?
- Stream of consciousness.
- You like writing?
- It's okay.
Stacy, can I ask you something?
I don't smoke, I don't drink,
and I can't afford drugs.
- What do you want out of life?
- What?
What do you want to be
when you get older?
Not this again! I don't know.
I suppose whatever I want
when I get there.
Do we have to panic yet?
Do you feel like you could do anything?
Sure.
What about getting married?
Having children?
Not if they're anything like Douglas.
<i>- Get back!
<i>- What's the big idea?
Busy?
Bad day?
We lost the town houses.
We lost the town houses.
Nathan and Trennery won the tender.
Sorry.
Just let me save this.
Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!
- How am I to work with this crap?
- Whoa, lighten up. Can't be that bad.
You've got backup, haven't you?
That's a whole day's work
down the drain.
I've got to get a new computer.
We'll see.
I wasn't asking your permission, Rob.
Frankly, I don't see why
we need a whole new computer...
just because you forgot to back up.
Anyway, that thing's good enough
for your purposes, isn't it?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I just don't understand why
You're getting so hysterical over it.
Well, it is my work, isn't it?
Yes, I know it is.
Don't patronize me.
I wasn't patronizing you.
You don't take
my work seriously, do you?
Oh, God, here we go.
You never thought I was
as smart as you.
- Come on. Don't be silly.
- Stupid, don't you mean?
Christ, give it a rest, will you?
I haven't got the energy.
- My God! You haven't changed.
- Should I have?
Just out of interest, when was
the last time you changed the sheets?
<i>And she's going to show me
<i>through the museum.
<i>This'll be interesting.
No drama. Mom just needs
some time to herself.
- See ya.
- Can't you wait for your sister once?
- Have you seen Stacy?
- No. Come on, mate.
Are you getting up?
You're gonna be late.
You should be pleased.
It means that you're becoming a woman.
Really, most girls
would be thrilled about it.
I think the whole thing sucks!
Mom!
I can't work out what's what!
Well...
this is like they've
cut you down the middle, and this is--
This is where it's suppose to go.
It doesn't really help.
You just have to feel your way.
Would you like me to--
Are you okay in there?
I can't do it. It hurts.
There's no hurry, honey.
Why don't you just stick
to the pants this time?
Surfboards.
<i>- Urine output hasn't improved.
<i>- And her temperature's staying up.
I'm just going down to the shops.
I won't be long, okay?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Go!
<i>The antibiotics should've had
<i>some effect by now.
- Hi.
- Thought I'd been stood up.
I can't stay long.
Well, do you think you can manage
a cup of coffee?
I've got a quick-boil kettle.
Actually, I don't think
I should be here at all.
You don't?
I don't.
Hungry?
Starving.
Great. Don't move.
I hope you drink Spanish wine.
It's all I've got.
- Will I change the top sheet as well?
- What?
Yes, please.
And they both fit in
the washing machine together?
Do we have matching pillow slips?
If I'm putting on the fowery sheets,
will the blue pillow slips do?
Is it finished?
Is what finished?
The article.
So the pressure's off?
Because it's just that I've sort of
asked Geoff and Janine...
over for dinner tomorrow night.
How ''sort of'?
Completely sort of.
But nothing special, I said.
That'll be all right, won't it?
- Cheers.
- Good morning, Pamela. How are you?
Could you get this up
to Diedre Reynolds, A.S.A.P.?
Sure. No problem.
Can you pop her name on it?
Flying visit, eh?
Yes, it is, actually.
You're good at that.
Can we talk?
Ben, I'm sorry about the other day.
- Was it something I did or said?
- God, no.
Then what?
Tell me you're not interested
and I'll leave you alone.
Oh, God.
I don't know how to explain this.
I can't see you.
- It's complicated.
- Is there someone else?
Come on! Mum!
- Mum?
- It's not what you think.
What I think is that
You're somebody's mother.
By the way you're behaving, married
to somebody's father. Am I warm?
- I guess so.
- You guess so?
- All right, yes.
- Is that all?
Three kids, a mortgage, a dog,
two goldfish and a husband.
But it's not really me.
I don't know how long it's gonna last.
Is this how you tell your readers
to keep the magic alive?
- I can explain.
- Can you?
Listen--
Would you believe
I'm having a midlife crisis?
What's this?
What is it?
Smells interesting.
And try not to pick a fight
with Geoff, okay?
At least not in the first five minutes.
- Is it Janine?
- Is what Janine?
Or Harriet, maybe.
That makes sense. She's not nubile,
but she's nice and young.
- What are you talking about?
- It is, isn't it?
You're actually
fucking the baby-sitter.
Of course I'm not!
Don't be ridiculous!
Well, who is it then?
- Can we talk about this later?
- I'd rather know now.
Pam, believe me.
I'm telling you, there's no one.
Oh, please. Give me a break.
Is that what the little business trip
to Melbourne was all about?
There's no other woman! I swear!
Great, Pammy.
I mean, it's very, very tasty.
Very good.
Rob said you've been branching out
on the old cuisine lately.
- What do you call this little creation?
- Risotto.
It's very-- It's very interesting.
- It's like Italian porridge, isn't it?
- Honey, don't.
What?
So, Geoff...
I see you still chew
with your mouth open.
- Need some help there, Pammy?
- No, thank you.
Who are you trying to convince
in there, them or you?
What?
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I'm an old, disobedient dog.
I just can't stand being apart.
I have to see you again.
I'm going crazy.
I mean, this is torture.
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can't stand it when we're apart.
I think you better go back inside.
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.
Geoff wielding a tea towel.
Wonders will never cease.
How can I convince you?
What do I have to say?
Nothing. Doesn't matter.
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
I'm not cheating on you.
- What makes you think that I am?
- Nothing.
I know you're not.
Just forget it. Can we, please?
- Please forget it.
- Christ, Pam.
Things were just starting
to work for us again.
Look, I know I haven't been
the world's best husband...
but I swear, I haven't--
with anybody.
- For ages.
- You what?
I swear. Not recently.
You know that.
Got another one of those?
It's stale.
Do you remember how much
we used to smoke when we first met?
I think we even used to roll our own.
There was always bits
of tobacco in the bed.
Did we ever change
the sheets in those days?
Robert, are we staying together
because of the children?
- Is that what you think?
- Is there anything else left?
I know we've run off the tracks,
but I'm trying.
And lately I've been feeling that...
there's hope.
Something's changed, Pam.
You seem...
different.
Look, I don't know
what you want, but...
I want it back.
Our marriage.
I want it back.
I love you.
I've always loved you.
Good boy, Brandy. Down.
It's done.
What's done?
I left Janine last night.
She took it pretty badly.
She doesn't know about...
you.
- Get off, Geoffrey. Go home.
- Come on, Pammy.
You got to come away with me.
Come away?
Do you honestly think...
that I would leave
this family for you?
That I would ever choose you?
Well, yeah.
Hello? Hi, Deidre.
Rewrite it?
Yes, I know the brief, but listen,
the topic's just not that simple.
You mean you want more
of the same moronic shit...
that your crappy magazine
usually turns out.
Perhaps you should do the rewrite
uourself. When it comes to moronic...
You're a natural.
Come on, Pammy.
Sorry, Geoffrey,
but I never liked you.
When's Mummy gonna be home?
Surprise!
It's not top of the range,
but it should be an improvement.
Thanks.
<i>- Where are we going?
<i>-Somewhere special.
<i>- It's a surprise.
<i>- Dad, why is it such a secret?
<i>- Come on, Dad!
<i>-All right, all right.
<i>We're going back to your mother's
<i>and my old stamping ground.
- La Fontana.
- Why can't we just go to Pizza Hut?
What's so good about this place?
For your information, you wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for this place.
This is where I
proposed to your mother.
Really? What did she say?
- This is great, isn't it?
- Bet they don't do pan pizzas.
Brings back memories. Do you remember
the last time we came here?
- Gosh, seems like another life.
- Sure does.
I was thinking.
What do you say we take...
a decent break over Christmas and rent
the cottage down by the beach?
- Yes!
- Eh? We haven't done that in years.
Really? Can we?
Can I bring someone?
Ooh, what's his name?
Could be just what we need.
Time together away from everything.
We could call it a second honeymoon.
A what?
Oh, my God. How embarrassing.
- Go on, open it.
- Open it!
Open it, dumbhe--
Mum.
I know you're gonna think
this is a little corny, but--
Well, I was wondering if you'd--
- I mean, if we--
- Dad.
You're supposed to get on your knees.
Oh, hell.
How about taking out an option
on another 13 years?
Yuck! Do we have to go
to church and get dressed up?
What do you say?
Well?
Photo, folks? Looks like
you've got something to celebrate.
Great idea!
Good. It works best if we keep
the couple together...
and arrange the little ones
around them.
Go behind Dad. That's it.
Off you go.
- How about Nipper on Dad's knee?
- Right. Come on, Rupert.
No, I need to go to the toilet.
Sorry.
Back in a minute.
- Where the hell have you been?
- What did you say?
Nothing, Rupert.
What happened?
Well?
- I guess I had to find out.
- Find out what?
What would have happened
if I had said no to Robert.
Do you think I never wondered?
What if I hadn't had children?
What it would feel like...
to have my own time,
my own money, my own bed.
What it would be like to sit down
and read a whole book...
or a whole chapter or even a whole page
without being interrupted.
To remember who I am...
not '' Darling'' or '' Mummy''...
or '' Dummy'' or '' Mum.''
Just me. Pamela.
But what happened
between me and Robert?
I know we've got to make some changes.
I still love him,
if that's what you mean.
Mummy!
Daddy! Daddy! Mummy's back!
She's back!
May I?
Yes.
Where's Rupert?
Rupert, come on.
Next to Mum.
Good boy!
A big smile.
<i>I sit here by myself
<i>and you know I love it
<i>You know I don't want someone
<i>To come pay a visit
<i>I wanna be by myself
<i>I came in this world alone
<i>Me myself I
<i>I want to go to China
<i>And to see Japan
<i>I'd like to sail the oceans

- Coming in for some cannelloni tonight?
- Not tonight. I'm cooking.
Yeah, I know.
I shouldn't be here.
Maybe I'm doing the wrong thing.
I admit it was a mistake
bringing the kids on our first date.
- Kids?
- And Molly throwing up on you--
- I see how it might have put you off.
- Thanks.
Look, Ben, I don't expect you
to understand this...
but whatever I've said...
or done lately...
I wasn't myself.
Just tell me you're not interested
and I'll leave you alone.
- What about Sophie?
- Sophie?
- The love of your life.
- What?
- Your wife.
- My ex-wife, you mean.
Look, I know it's not simple.
And I know you weren't looking
for an instant family.
And the fact is,
I do have the kids half the time...
but Molly hardly ever vomits,
I swear.
Look, I'm sorry.
I haven't done this for a while.
I just wanted to ask if you'd
give it another go.
You know, do something sometime--
go dancing or shoot some pool.
- Or I could cook dinner.
- Dinner?
Obligation free.
I guess not.
Can they wipe their own bottoms?
One of them can. The other one
can be a bit hit and miss.
- Not that it bothers me.
- Don't worry. That's my job.
So, is that a maybe?
Yes, that's a maybe.
That's my orange.
Shit.
