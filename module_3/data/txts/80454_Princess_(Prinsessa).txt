The White Princess...
<i>"For seven
years support has grown in Europe</i>
<i>"for Prince Richard.</i>
<i>"Soon he will be ready
to come against Henry."</i>
The Duchess of Burgundy has invited
me to be a guest at her court.
I shall send you in my stead.
Richard was my brother.
And I miss him every day.
But that boy is not him.
<i>My son, Prince Richard,</i>
who is alive and well in Burgundy...
God makes you sick as
punishment for your lies.
Proof of treachery from their own hands.
Sir William Stanley.
I am loyal to the rightful king!
Richard of York!
The princes. One of them got away.
- You killed them.
- I did not!
You ordered it.
I cannot know for certain
if it was carried out.
Henry needs to know
what is done in his name.
Help me, Lord.

Before I die...
You are not a king, nor fit to be one.
<i>England rots beneath you.</i>
Men weep.
So, kill me.
And you will kill many others after me.
Men who will line up to say,
"Long live the true, able
"King...
Richard."
Arthur.
You will never wear the crown if
you cannot watch a traitor die.
If the man who won the
field at Bosworth for me
- could betray me, then...
- The rest are loyal.
Are they?
- Are you?
- Of course I am.
<i>I saw your face.</i>
The day of Harry's ennobling banquet.
When your mother said your
brother Richard lives.
You couldn't look at me.
As you can't now.
Henry, we...
We...
- I wanted to tell you.
- Oh, God.
Please.
What my mother said,
there was some truth in it!
We put a servant boy in the Tower
in my brother Richard's place
and we sent him off to safety.
When you sent soldiers to bring
me to Westminster as your wife,
my brother was with us.
We hid him when your men arrived.
Then you have lied to me.
For years
No.
We have heard nothing from him since.
My mother wrote to half of
Europe searching for him.
Anywhere he could have
gone she begged for word,
and nobody knew anything.
He'd vanished.
Then we learned that the
soldiers tore our house apart.
Slaughtered every boy they found.
And then we understood the silence.
That is how I know the boy in
Burgundy is just another fraud.
My brother is dead.
Dead?
Dead.
Yet you have never told me this before.
When we were first wed,
I was full of malice.
Then my reasons for not
telling you changed.
I convinced myself I was shielding you.
From what?
Fear.
So the boy is not Richard.
No.
Then who is he?
Because his marriage to the
Scottish girl is underway.
And when the wedding feast is done,
whoever he may be,
he wants my kingdom.
<i>Not
just King James of Scotland.</i>
<i>There are faces from every
royal house in Europe.</i>
Apart from Spain.
They're busy with their
newfound world and wealth.
They would not trouble
themselves with our small lives.
Perhaps they're more
inclined to Tudor's side?
What can Tudor offer them?
<i>Amen.</i>
Thank you. Thank you.
You are very beautiful.
I'm very lucky.
It was hard to leave her.
Her peace as she lies sleeping.
Her beauty will look even better
on the throne of England.
And peace comes after war.
Has King James of Scotland
said he will support me?
There is no surety of it.
Your cause is your own affair
and waging war on
England may seem to him
too high a cost in gold and men.
You must rejoin the celebrations.
Work hard with him,
and the other heads of state.
But we must have Scotland or
we'll fail before we start.
Elizabeth sends funds.
Your mother.
And I shall furnish you with
ecus from my own gold stores.
It is a start.
<i>I miss him too.</i>
I wish that he were here to
share his wisdom with me.
I'm lost without him.
But three months have passed and...
I cannot bear to...
I cannot lose you and my uncle.
Please.
- She feels Jasper's death quite keenly.
- Mmm.
This has come for you, Your Grace.
From Burgundy.
Ah.
My men in Burgundy have unmasked him.
The boy is the son of a
boatman from Tournai
and his name is Perkin Warbeck.
Writing my letter to
Scotland will be a joy.
<i>Let's see how it pleases King James to
learn that he has shamed his cousin</i>
by marrying her to Sir
No One from Nowhere.
Scotland will throw him
back to where he came from
<i>and Europe will deny
they ever met with him.</i>
What is it?
My mother writes to me again.
Bids me visit.
You are good, Maggie,
to come to me when even
my own daughter won't.
We were coming to London
to visit Teddy anyway.
You saw him.
Didn't you?
My son, Prince Richard.
Has he grown very fair?
We saw a pretender, Your Grace.
Nothing more.
I fear that I shall die before
I lay my own eyes on him.
Or see my Lizzie again.
Please. Bid her come to me.
<i>Lizzie.</i>
We have not had a chance to speak in
private since my trip to Burgundy.
What would we speak of, Maggie?
Traitors to my husband's reign?
The nightmares that my son has had
since he witnessed the
beheading of a man he loved?
I'm told you've been to
see my mother once again.
She wants to see you, Lizzie.
She's unwell.
I suppose she is still writing
to my aunt in Burgundy?
We have abandoned our
attempts to stop it.
Better that we let her do it
and have the monks make copies
so we know what web she weaves.
She did show me a letter
she had just received.
Everyone in Europe has accepted him.
They all came to the wedding.
Apart from Spain.
Your aunt writes, "Isabella is so lofty
"with her newfound wealth
- and self-importance..."
- Spain did not attend?
You are certain of it?
It was in the letter.
So will you visit her then? Lizzie?
We must settle Arthur's betrothal.
To the Princess Catherine of Aragon.
Alone of all of Europe, Spain
refused to meet the boy.
<i>Perhaps they have no interest with
their new vast lands and riches but...</i>
You've always said that
Arthur is too young
and that he will choose
his wife for love.
Well, now I am saying he is old enough.
She is reputed to be beautiful.
Mmm.
It will give him something
good to dwell on
and ally us with the
strongest force in Europe.
<i>If Europe backed the boy,</i>
<i>they would've matched him
with a far more powerful wife</i>
than third cousin-to-the-left of the ruler
of the poorest land in Christendom.
There simply isn't a threat.
Mm. The Queen is right.
<i>If we can come to terms with
Isabella of Castile, then</i>
none would dare to wake that sleeping
giant, now, or in the future.
It would be the best deterrent.
And the dowry would be significant.
We will not leave it to a letter.
We will go there in person.
Bless me, Cardinal Morton...
For I have sinned.
You are the most devout
<i>of our savior's subjects.</i>
<i>- God...</i>
- He hates me.
He has deserted me.
I went to Jasper.
<i>He was dying.</i>
I could not...
You couldn't save him, no.
- But you tried to.
- I did not try.
<i>But it is God</i>
who calls us mortal men
to Heaven when he chooses.
No act of ours can change that.
Your sacrifice for him
has been immense.
Losing those we love can test our faith.
<i>A pilgrimage</i>
will help you find your way.
Rededicate yourself to God.
Pay alms to the abbeys.
Luke 11:41.
"Give as alms what is within,
"and everything will be clean to you."
<i>Godspeed, Your Grace.</i>
We're returning to our home in Wales.
I have an honor to bestow upon you.
I'll make you Gentleman of the Privy
Chamber to Arthur, Prince of Wales.
You'll be his tutor and his
guardian in my absence.
It will be my pleasure.
I can think of no one better than a loyal
Tudor soldier who reminds me of my uncle.
We will take him home with us today.
No, you will stay here with
him at the palace, Lady Pole.
- But... Our son is...
<i>- He will be brought here.</i>
I will send men to collect him.
Of course, Your Grace.
Will we tend to Prince Harry as well?
<i>He will be
left in my mother's care.</i>
She is fond of him and he may
pull her from her grief.
They're going on a pilgrimage together.
Small mercies anyway.
Harry is a handful.
I know you hate to be at court but
we'll make more time for
Teddy while we're here.
And before you know it,
we'll be back home again.
First we will
go to Wimborne Minster.
Where I grew up and where
my father is buried.
Was he a king?
He was a sinner.
Sometimes I fear God is
punishing me for it.
Why couldn't I go to Spain with Father?
Or stay with Arthur?
You are the second son.
While your brother will be king,
you may be pope.
And answer only to the Lord, your God.
As we all must, in the end.
Scotland brings you one step
closer to your kingdom.
But...
As they have yet to
pledge their support,
you will need to bring
your York charm into play.
Make him happy.
But not so happy he forgets his cause.
It is a shared cause now.
And I will loan to him
whatever strength he needs.
And keep some for yourself.
And make that child a boy.
Lady Grandmother, do not fear for me.
This work is God's work.
And he will decide the outcome.
I doubt sometimes that it is even him.
You have had seven years of
calling him your grandson.
But the boy I
knew had different eyes.
I'm sure they were green.
His brother Edward had the green eyes.
Richard, always blue.
You're afraid of losing him.
As I am. As we all are.
But his destiny is to destroy
that creature Henry Tudor
<i>and bring us back our peace.</i>
Is it?
<i>Or is it just your vengeance</i>
that would take another
innocent boy's life?
King Henry. Queen Elizabeth.
I am Rodrigo De Puebla.
Welcome to the Alhambra.
Your Graces.
<i>Princess Catalina of Aragon.</i>
Your Graces.
I present Queen Isabel De Castilla
<i>and King Fernando De Aragon.</i>
Protectors of the Catholic Faith.
Our country's beloved mother and father.
Your Graces.
I present King Henry VII of England
and his Queen, Elizabeth.
Thank you for the wonderful dancing.
<i>We are most charmed by your daughter.</i>
We are honored to visit
your most beautiful palace.
It has long been my wish to form an
alliance between our two great nations
with a marriage of our son
and heir, Prince Arthur,
and Princess Catherine.
_
You saw
our daughter, Catalina.
<i>She's beautiful and rich.</i>
Daughter to the mightiest
land in Europe.

She says both
Arthur and Catherine are very young.
She wishes for a papal dispensation.
That will take time.
So she will write to the Pope
and he will grant it, and
we will have our alliance.
If her wishes are met, then yes.
More masses for his soul.
Why did you give the priest gold?
What did you buy from him?
In giving, I find grace.
If you dedicate yourself to God
then everything you do will be his will.
Though you may sometimes doubt him
his will is the light that guides
your hand in everything you do.
Even when the thing you do
is costly to your person.
How many do we have to visit?
As many as it takes to hear his voice.
Richard.
You're getting closer.
You're coming home.
What is it?
The boy has crossed the
River Tweed at Coldstream.
King James rides with him, and his army.
No!
<i>Wake Prince Arthur. We'll take
him to the royal apartment</i>
in the Tower for his safety.
But Father said the
Scottish wouldn't come.
- Have you sent word to him?
- He'll be met at the docks with news.
Teddy?
Teddy?
<i>Teddy?</i>
<i>This is your cousin, Prince Arthur.</i>
Did you sin too?
<i>Nobody sinned.</i>
What are you doing?
My Lady the King's Mother.
I've come to hasten you to Beaulieu.
We are going there on pilgrimage.
You must come quickly.
Cornwall has risen up and
they are marching this way
bound for London, armed
with pikes and staffs.
- Cornwall?
- They are angry at the new tax.
Scotland has invaded,
and now Englishmen are taxed to
pay for soldiers to defend us.
They say the York Pretender leads
the Scottish into England.
- Oh, he cannot. No, he cannot.
<i>- Please,</i>
<i>come quickly.</i>
You were very kind to
bring us here to safety.
Who knows what would've happened
if you hadn't ridden out to us.
We would never enter heaven
if we did not save you and
the Prince from harm.
You have no library here.
I will have one built
and stocked for you.
You're very kind, Your Grace.
We are in your debt.
When they have passed,
we will return to London.
God does not smile upon my pilgrimage.
How many?
How many does the boy have with him?
We believe it is 4,000.
All Scottish, or have others
joined his cause now too?
They say the boy has 1,400 mercenaries
from Germany and Flanders.
A tax was levied to
raise the funds to pay our men.
We are mustering.
But the Cornish are up
in arms about the tax,
and men must be dispatched
to quell them too.
They feel the Scottish borders
are a long way from their door
and they shouldn't have to pay for
a war that isn't their concern.
The leaders are camped on Blackheath hoping
the men of Kent will rise with them.
So I cannot muster from
Cornwall, or from Kent.
Anywhere else?
Is Essex with me? Suffolk? Or is all
the south and southwest lost to me?
Send men to quell the Cornish and have the
rest made ready to ride north with me.
And Spain, Your Grace? Is Spain with us?
Mark the names of those who do
not come, they are against me.
Hire mercenaries to boost our numbers.
We have no allies.
Where is my son? Prince Arthur?
He is in the Tower, Your Grace.
For his safety.
And Prince Harry returns from his
pilgrimage with My Lady the King's Mother.
They are under guard.
I have never gone to
battle without Jasper.
He's still with you, Henry.
His strength rides with
you onto the battlefield.
And so does mine.
I will return to you a victor.
I prayed, Henry.
I was obedient to the Lord.
- But now the boy has come against you...
- Harry? Come.
Find my son.
Prince Richard.
Give him what he needs
to win.
To fight.
<i>To stay alive.</i>
We've protected all the sentries.
<i>Come.</i>
This way.
Wait.
<i>Listen.</i>
<i>Where are they?</i>
It is over.
- He withdrew.
- Henry.
He did not
have the will to fight me.
He could not bring himself
to take up arms against
God's own annointed king.
What, and so he ran?
Well, then he is not a York.
No York man would ever run from battle.
No one will believe his claim again.
I never thought that we would have this.
But we do.
And none shall take it from us.
What was he thinking?
After all that I have done for him?
He leaves the battlefield
to greet an infant.
Her time came early.
He was fearful.
King James says that he
has had his money wasted.
He is threatening to make
his peace with Tudor.
The boy should not have done this.
He does as he pleases.
He is behaving...
- Behaving like a...
- A king?
A king who now has a son.
<i>A York heir.</i>
Henry will be murderous.
He didn't run away.
He left to see his newborn son.
A son?
He has an heir.
<i>No.</i>
And with that, his
claim is strengthened,
false as it is, and others
will declare for him.
Well, he withdrew.
- Perhaps he will not come again.
- He'll come.
We don't know where or
when, but he will come.
And I must pray the
nobles will support me
because the new tax on the peasants
will ensure that they do not.
<i>We need Spain more than ever.</i>
I will pray.
Oh, My Lady!
My Lady!
There are over 50.
All of England's noble families
must turn out for you.
And I have written to
ensure that they will.
Your mother is dying.
You must go to her.
I regret that I did not see Jasper.
He asked for me.
And I shall never know what
he would have said to me.
Go.
The boy has done what
I would in his shoes.
You see, he sailed from
Scotland to Land's End and
8,000 Cornish men have joined
him, out of hate for me.
My army gathers. I must go to them.
I waited for you.
I'm here.
What we have lived through together.
Now Melusina sings for me.
No.
No, she doesn't.
Please, Lizzie.
<i>Be there for your brother.</i>
He is gone, Mother.
You think I have not been fair to you.
It doesn't matter, I love you, Mother.
Stay with me.
Help Richard.
Keep him from danger.
Promise me you will.
Richard is gone.
He is coming, Lizzie.
I feel it.
Can you hear her singing?
No.
No!
Mother, please!
Go, Cathy.
It's time.
Take our son and claim sanctuary.
Promise me you will win
back your kingdom.
I will come for you
both when I have won.
Go. Go.
Hey!
_
_
<i>Queen Elizabeth.</i>
<i>What do you
mean, they've deserted me?</i>
<i>So few of
them turned out for you</i>
<i>that the ones who did feel torn</i>
and say they will not
fight their own kind.
Henry.
Lizzie.
She is gone.
I had to see you.
You rode all through the night.
The noblemen whom I
wrote to did not come?
They claim the swelling sickness.
Something else to blame me for.
What?
Since Spain is not with us they
feel we are alone in all of Europe,
while the boy has every kingdom and
my own men flocking to his side.
No.
No, they are traitors.
They will not do this.
My Lords! My Lords!
Do you know me?
Of course, Your Grace.
You are the Queen of England.
Then listen to your Queen
when I command you!
England is invaded by a
pretender and the Scots!
Since when have Englishmen
feared Gaels and Celts
and run from warfare with their
tails between their legs?
They say he is the true king,
Richard of York.
If he were Richard, he would be my
brother and I would tell you so myself!
But he is here to kill your kin
and rob England of what was never his!
If you fear God
then you will honor your
true king, Henry Tudor!
And if you will not do it for your King
then do it for me!
The daughter of Edward IV
and Queen Elizabeth Woodville,
who has just passed from
this life into God's hands.
Your men are here and they support you.
When this battle is over
you will live in peace
with your families
knowing that you have done
your duty to your King,
your God,
and to your Queen.
How can I thank you?
Come back to me.
To us.
You must go.
The guards will take you back to London.
Henry, I...
Tell me afterwards.
Guards, shields!
Shields!
Shields up!
March!
Where did he go?
Where is the boy?
You won, Henry.
He withdrew, this is good news.
You think this is the end of it?
That he won't raise more
men and then return?
What?
What is it?
He's claimed sanctuary.
The boy?
Where is he? At Beaulieu Abbey.
So I cannot even send my
men to bring him to me?
Not men.
I can do it.
God's ways are mysterious indeed.
Now I understand my pilgrimage.
He confirms that what I
do is God's work and
<i>my calling</i>
is to be the guardian of his reign.
Abbot.
Please bring out the boy.
<i>We know that he is here.</i>
My Lady the King's Mother...
We could not refuse him sanctuary.
You did what
any holy man would do.
<i>But your allegiance is
to God and to the King.</i>
And I am on God's work.
You will find the definition
in the Bible, in your library.
Has he something else to wear?
We could give him holy robes.
Disrobe.
Exchange your clothes with him.
Your impudence offends the Lord.
Take those garments off.
I've won a king, and that makes three.
Harry, show your cards or stop cheating.
I wasn't cheating.
My Lady, Your Grace.
A message from your Lady Mother.
She has the boy.
I win.
