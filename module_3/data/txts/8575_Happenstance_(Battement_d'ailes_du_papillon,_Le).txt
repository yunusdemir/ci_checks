HAPPENSTANCE
You have a friendly face.
What about me?
Do I have a friendly face?
You have a nice smile.
I smile less and less.
You like to laugh.
That's obvious.
On your way to work?
- What do you do?
- I'm a salesgirl.
- In what?
- Household appliances.
Are you single?
What shampoo do you use?
I'm not prying, but I have
this questionnaire.
For a survey.
Gotta earn a living.
So then...
"Anti-dandruff?"
"Oily hair?"
"Frequent use?"
I don't care which.
We'll put "frequent use."
What's your name?
Irene Cotentin.
Thanks.
Your date of birth, too.
March 1 1 , 1977.
Pisces!
I just read something on Pisces.
Here it is...
Pisces.
"Love.
"The effects of the full moon
on your love life
will be devastating."
"You will cross paths
with your soul mate."
"Love is around the corner."
Getting off?
See that?
You're going to meet
true love today!
Why today?
Because of the full moon.
So?
Tonight's the full moon.
Mister!
You can't stay here.
You nuts?
I'm sick.
Move it.
Come on.
- I'm dying.
- Yeah, right.
Carry it on your
conscience, bitch!
Move it, I said.
Keep going.
- This'll bring you bad luck.
- Right.
- I'm going to die.
- But not here.
- Bitch!
- Go croak somewhere else.
- But the full moon was last night.
- Really?
You believe this
horoscope stuff?
Why not?
- I was born March 1 1 , 1977, too.
- Really?
Read me the rest?
"You will cross paths
with your soul mate.
Love is around the corner.
But, careful!
Be patient.
"Venus will slightly
delay your meeting.
Your true love is within reach.
Don't let him or her get away."
Venus...
Look at that star.
That's the planet Venus.
If you get lost during the night,
it will showyou the way.
Stop!
Police!
You won $2,000,
so buy us drinks.
That's nothing to sneeze at!
Buy one last round.
You can sure afford it.
He always was cheap.
Fuck off!
Mommy, I have to pee.
Go in the ditch there.
So fast?
Let's go.
C'mon, Athos.
What is it, honey?
I saw Daddy.
He's dead!
What are you saying?
His head's bleeding.
Calm down!
It was just a bad dream.
- What is it?
- He had a nightmare.
Daddy's fine.
He's home.
He's in Paris.
He's dead.
I saw him.
Stop saying that!
This is Richard and Marie.
We're not in right now.
Please leave a message.
- Well?
- No one.
At this time of night?
It's weird.
I'll call as soon as
I get to Paris.
It's me again.
I don't knowwhere you are...
I'm worried.
I arrive tomorrow
on the 1 1 :45 a.m. train.
Don't make a face.
It's better this way.
You can tell her everything.
This couldn't go on.
And quit smoking.
It's annoying.
You believe this
horoscope stuff?
Why not?
What's with him?
- He sick?
- I think so.
The guy's dying
and you just sit there.
- You do nothing!
- I am, I am...
But I am.
Shit, you're creepy.
Move, do something!
He dead?
No, he isn't.
He's moaning.
Do something.
I don't knowwhat.
Out of the way.
Let me!
Go get help, quick.
If you're afraid to tell
her, write it out first.
- All right, already.
- What are you doing?
Not on the ground!
If everyone did that...
Use the trash outside.
We have lots to share.
Without me
you'd still be littering.
It's common.
It starts with hypothermia.
They're cold.
They wait for the subway to open.
Then inside they get too hot,
and they collapse.
Nice of you to wait with me.
Not late for anything, I hope?
- Don't you have a job?
- Sure.
I'm a lawyer.
I'm defending a terrorist
in a bombing.
It was in the papers.
Hurry up!
There's a man dying!
You can't smoke here.
- What is this?
- Put out that cigarette!
Right now, please!
But I'm the one who called you!
I've still got time.
I'll go have a coffee.
I've got to be going.
See you later.
I'll wait for you in the park.
Don't make such a face!
Go on.
I love you.
Excuse me.
- Is Mrs. Viennot in?
- She just stepped out.
You know for how long?
An hour or two maybe.
Then I'll wait here.
What's an hour or two?
What's it about?
A job as museum guard.
I had an appointment.
If you want,
I can handle that.
Sure.
My name is Luc Gosener.
G-O-S-E-N-E-R.
My mother is a friend
of Mrs. Viennot.
Are you available
as of 3:00 p.m. today?
There's a position
at the Zadkin Museum.
I have the job?
Why not?
Just like that?
No interview, nothing?
I prepared.
Amazing!
- Find that strange?
- Why not?
I mean it.
I apologize.
- For what?
- Being late.
It's 10:50.
I was due at 10.
- It's all right.
- It's not.
I want you to know I'm serious.
I left the house on time,
about 9:30, even ahead of time.
I took the subway.
I was waiting for a train...
And I saw a bum sitting near me,
sleeping, or dozing,
next to a man, a perfectly
normal-looking commuter.
And suddenly the bum collapsed...
Just like that.
The man next to him did nothing.
He just looked at him.
So I went and
took the bum's pulse.
He was still alive,
but his heartbeat was weak.
I immediately diagnosed
hypothermia.
I shouted for someone to
call the emergency squad.
Everybody just looked at me,
staring wide-eyed!
Finally an agent arrived.
I did some C.P.R., made sure
he wouldn't swallow his tongue.
And we waited.
That's it.
I'm revolted by some
people's behavior.
A guy's dying
and they do nothing!
It's sickening.
I'm not telling you
this as an excuse.
It's just so you know
who I am.
It's a good thing I'm late.
A good deed is always rewarded.
Otherwise I might've been
on time
and might not have gotten
the job.
Who knows?
lsn't that so?
Julie...
- Nice name.
- I had nothing to do with it.
You're my lucky star, Julie.
I'd like to take you out
for coffee.
At noon.
Across the street.
Okay?
What'll you have?
Coffee and a brandy, please.
Why'd you say hello?
Know him?
No.
So what?
Do you have to know someone
to say hello?
People forget their manners.
I feel like saying hello,
so I do.
What's the harm?
Give me a coffee, too.
You're waiting for someone...
Aren't you?
A woman.
So am l.
A young woman.
Her name's Julie.
I work for the city.
I hire for the Paris museums.
She applied for a job
this morning.
We hit it off, so
I asked her out for coffee.
A charming young woman,
the pensive sort.
She's very vulnerable,
someone not made for
the cruel modern world.
I hired her as a guard.
It's her first job.
Her mother can't
support her anymore...
No kiss?
What's going on?
Look, I'm leaving you.
We fell out of love years ago.
We stay together out of habit.
You tell me that here?
Where should I tell you?
Sure, a station's a place
to say, "l love you."
But "l don't
love you anymore?"
You sound like
you're reading lines.
But it's true.
I just want things to change,
before it's too late.
I don't want to.
I don't want to lose you,
and end up alone.
I didn't mean to make you cry.
I just want things to change.
I can't go on like this.
- You agree with me, no?
- Sure!
I'm such a dope...
There's another woman.
Right?
Say it instead of lying.
Say it!
Yes, there's another woman.
A woman who loves me, and
can't stand this situation.
She asked me to tell you today.
I don't believe it!
You didn't even
decide it yourself?
You're amazing!
Unbelievable!
You're such a coward,
you make me sick!
You poor jerk!
I chose one...
the Zadkin Museum.
With a garden.
Peaceful.
Sorry, not interested.
I'm the one who's sorry.
I disturbed your thoughts.
That's right.
You did.
Coffee comes with chocolate now?
Yup.
That's nice.
But you can keep it.
You don't want it?
It's Swiss dark chocolate.
But we're going to stop.
Only half the customers eat it.
"lf he eats his chocolate,
I tell Marie everything."
"BIG ASSHOLE"
Get out of my sight!
- Why?
- Get out of my sight!
See that?
He skipped on the bill.
Shit, I didn't see a thing!
The guy's a pro.
Relax, I got him memorized.
If I see him again, I'll corner him,
get him to pay you.
I keep a lighter in my pocket.
I don't smoke, I use it
as brass knuckles.
- Skip it.
- Don't pay for him!
I've got a philosophy.
So have l.
Coffee and brandy, how much?
5 bucks.
Think I'm out 5 bucks?
Wrong, fella.
Dead wrong.
It's more like I got
a $5 credit line.
Get me?
What's the chance you'll die
of a bee sting?
No idea?
3 million to 1 chance.
Better odds than
winning the lottery.
Think the lottery's just chance?
Sure, there are guys who wipe
their ass with $100 bills.
Only because they deserve it.
Assholes win, too.
I wouldn't want to be
in their shoes.
It could be risky.
Admit you got screwed.
Don't believe me?
I'll prove I'm right.
See that?
"20%%% discount on all
household appliances."
You think I lost $5?
Don't make me laugh!
With this coupon
I can get huge savings.
Say I want to buy...
I don't know...
What can I buy?
A fridge, for $300.
20%%% off is how much?
3 times 20...
- Lemme figure...
- $60.
5 times the outlay.
What do you say now?
What are you doing?
Keep it.
This way, I keep
the ball rolling.
See?
I rack up points.
I get a bonus.
I couldn't tell her.
I didn't have the guts.
I don't love you enough...
Enough to hurt her like that.
I'd rather lose you.
"lf he scores,
I tell Elsa everything."
- You sure you'll score?
- Yeah.
Well, almost.
100% sure?
On the next throw...
Okay?
Fine.
Do me a favor?
Would you mind missing?
Howwould that be a favor?
All right.
See the man sitting...
over there?
I feel sure this man has
decided to play his fate
on that little pebble.
I'd really like to see
what happens if you miss.
Why not?
- Well?
- I told her everything.
I'm so happy.
It's a lovely day,
a day to be remembered.
I'm glad.
We've altered
the course of fate,
Iike a grain of sand
that jams the works.
You must take me for an old
nut who talks a lot of rot.
Maybe so.
You're partly right,
but only partly.
Listen to me,
there's not a gesture,
even the most insignificant,
that can't change the world.
That man there decided
to lie to his mistress
Iike he lied to his wife
on the simple toss
of a pebble.
You see, every detail,
every gesture,
as slight as it may be,
reveals an infinity of truths
and thus has an endless repercussion
and grandiose effects.
You only have to piss in the sea
to make the ocean rise.
Don't they say the beating
of a butterfly's wings
over the Atlantic can cause
a hurricane in the Pacific?
So feel free sometimes
to do something stupid,
random and ludicrous.
That stupid, random
and ludicrous act
can upset the order
of the world.
Seen Mrs. Viennot?
Yes.
Don't worry.
I start this afternoon.
I don't mean to scare you
but as of next month,
I can't give you money.
I can't pay your rent,
understand?
You're on your own now.
I can't deal with you,
your grandmother and my work.
I have to think about myself.
I love you both but I need
to live for myself...
a little.
- Howyou've grown!
- Hello, Granny.
He's 30.
He stopped growing.
Then I've shrunk.
No kiss?
I'm so glad to see you.
It's been so long.
Why do you never visit?
Because he failed
his driving test.
- You failed?
- A long time ago.
- Take it again.
- I can't afford it.
Let him talk.
I rarely see him
and you talk for him.
So?
I hope you didn't make lunch.
I go back to work at 2:30.
Remember?
I told you.
Yes, you did.
It's true.
Don't go batty on me.
The table's set
for some friends coming by.
You don't knowthem.
Will you have coffee?
I have a surprise for you.
- Why'd you buy this?
- It's for Luc.
He visits 3 times a year!
- Look...
- Yes, and...
Why doesn't it work?
Cheated again!
Old ladies always get cheated.
Take it back
and give them hell.
Come with me?
You got swindled,
you handle it.
Go on.
You'll get some exercise.
What's that?
Beat it!
I don't have much time left.
You're my favorite, so
I'll let you in on a secret.
See the milk carton...
Take it.
Open it.
When I go, you'll know.
You'll come over and take it all
without telling anyone.
Everything here is yours.
It won't be long now.
Get ready, Luc.
We're going.
I made you macaroons.
Don't let your mother see.
Hide them.
What's that?
Macaroons Granny made me.
Disgusting!
The old lady's losing her marbles.
She's really useless.
"Hurry!
"Last chance to enjoy
our special offer.
"20%%% off
all household appliances!"
Can I help you?
No...
just looking.
Irene...
Don't bother with that customer.
You're green.
Don't bother.
Learn to size people up.
I've learned in 10 years
on the job.
That guy's the example
of the customer who never buys.
A bad customer.
OK.
Why?
Did you see his teeth?
Absolutely no dental hygiene.
Slight limp.
Dirty hair, unwashed.
It's a weekday, 2 p.m.
So he's probably unemployed.
$300 unemployment,
plus $300 disability.
But there's a good category
of jobless:
the guy who watches TV all day
and nibbles is good for us?
That's not him.
Do you understand?
Why?
See the elbows of his jacket?
Completely shiny.
Why?
Picture him: he's at the bar.
He broods and broods.
It wears and wears.
He drinks and drinks.
He drinks to forget,
his buying power
is spent on drinks.
I can judge people now.
But it doesn't work!
I bought it for my grandson.
I'm telling you
it didn't turn on.
It's brand new!
I still have the guarantee.
It's expired, Ma'am, and
this coffee maker functions.
- Then what do I do?
- Read the instructions.
Just listening, that's all.
- Listening to what?
- Your conversation.
So?
It's wrong to torment her.
- Give her a new one!
- Let's calm down.
No point getting excited...
What's it cost you
to replace it?
You don't scare me.
I can stand here for hours.
So can l.
C'mon...
Where are we going?
Don't worry.
- Stay here.
- Why?
Just wait for me.
What do I do?
It lasts longer.
It's set at 15 bars.
- What's a bar?
- A measure of pressure.
You need pressure
to make espresso.
I don't like this brand.
It's guaranteed a year.
We can make you...
Catch him!
- Me?
- No, you.
Catch him!
You see that?
This one's guaranteed
for 3 years.
- Did you find him?
- I did.
And you let him go?
He's half-crippled.
I don't believe this...
Change jobs, girl.
Get your things.
In the staff room.
- I'll think it over.
- Just put it here.
Here, it's all yours!
Keep your damn coffee maker!
She lost her job
because of you.
You wanted to play Robin Hood.
A good deed can backfire.
Oh, shit!
He had no right to do that.
- I'll go back and explain.
- Don't bother, it's too late.
She says it's too late.
Her boss got angry.
It's normal.
She's not cut out for that job.
She can't sell coffee makers.
I'd like to give it to you.
I don't want it.
It can't replace a job, OK.
But it's something,
so you'll remember me kindly.
Mr. Gosener, you may not read,
smoke or go outdoors while on duty.
You can use the restroom
once every 4 hours.
You're off-duty at 8 p.m.
Here comes the curator
to welcome you.
Madam, this is Mr. Gosener.
What are you doing?
I forgot my keys and my friend's
not home from work yet.
You can't wait out there!
Come in.
- We'll have some tea.
- No, thanks.
I love young people.
I often meet your partner
when I take the garbage down.
You make a nice couple.
We're just roommates.
Sure, I was AC/DC once.
It's fine when you're young.
Have you been together long?
I said, we're roommates!
You're lucky.
In my day, you had
to be discreet.
I married, like everyone then.
He was a handsome young man,
he looked like a pop singer.
He died 10 years ago.
Or was it 15?
I forget.
I keep chasing after memories.
He got hit by a bus.
He died a year later,
after terrible suffering.
Those rap singers
are magnificent!
I adore their thick,
creased necks.
It's so virile-looking.
I'll do your tarot cards.
I love reading the future.
I see something...
I see...
It's cold.
I need to move around.
What will we get?
- What did you want?
- Whatever you like.
I love strawberries.
Strawberry pie for four.
- How much?
- $10.
Oh, look.
Remember in the park?
I said it was a day to remember.
I took the pebble as a memento.
Isn't it sweet?
It's so white.
I'll keep it all my life.
Why a pie for four?
I forgot to tell you.
We're eating at my parents.
Obviously, they knew
I had someone,
but obviously I didn't say
you're married.
But nowwe're sort
of official, right?
They'll be glad to meet you.
We're going tonight?
Obviously, they're expecting us.
- They knowwe're coming?
- Obviously.
You didn't hear.
I phoned while you were
in the shower.
Isn't it annoying that I say
"obviously" so much?
That's all I say.
You should call me on it.
What else could I say?
Look, Elsa,
I have to tell you...
My God, do you see that?
Did you see that?
I'm so happy!
You can't imagine!
I saw Frank again.
I mean, I'm seeing him tonight.
- Who's that?
- You know, Frank!
I told you about him
lots of times.
The guy I met 10 years ago.
We were madly in love.
We spent 2 years together.
We split up
over something stupid.
Then I saw him
totally by chance.
Like in a movie!
Let me tell you the story.
It's wild!
How are you?
I've got your pictures.
Here.
Revolting!
I don't believe this!
I know him!
It's Frank!
Hurry up, the guy's
about to croak!
What are you doing?
It's for you.
Personal.
Stephanie?
I don't believe it!
We're meeting tonight
for dinner.
Nothing like this
ever happened to me!
Can you sleep somewhere else?
- Like where?
- A hotel.
Why should l?
This place is tiny.
If we come back here,
three's a crowd.
Don't worry.
I'm leaving.
I'm going home.
- Where?
- To my mom's.
Good idea.
Take the 10 p.m. train,
you'll be there at 1 1 :30.
Good idea going home
to your folks.
What about your job?
I got fired.
Shit.
Look...
All the more reason
to go see your mom.
You'll be able to unwind.
Want me to help you pack?
Let's go.
- Where to?
- The station.
Now?
My train's in 4 hours!
You can get a cup of coffee.
I see what you're up to,
you know.
You just want me out of here.
You're really low.
Think I want to watch
you guys make out?
I'm out of here!
And I won't be back.
Don't take it that way!
Come back!
Shit!
- You're not French?
- What?
I'm in art school here.
Mom?
It's me.
Yes, your daughter.
I'll be home tonight.
Sorry to disturb you, folks.
I'm just out of the hospital.
It isn't my fault.
I'm selling metro
station guides.
Published by "The ltinerant."
It's $1 .50.
Not interested.
If you can't buy one,
then how 'bout some change,
or a meal ticket
to help me stay clean...
to sleep in a bed...
If you can't spare any money,
gimme a smile.
I shoulda stayed
in the hospital.
What dirty mugs...
A smile, get it?
A smile.
Think you make me want to smile?
With your filth,
your stink, your shit!
Why smile at a sight like you?
Wait, Mister.
- Keep the change.
- Have a nice day.
Why look at me like that?
Do I bother you?
Your behavior bothers me.
If you like smiling
at poverty, go ahead!
Bunch of jerks!
I can't come to the cafe
with you.
I would have loved to.
I've never been to art school.
I'm a museum guard.
I'm paid to sit around
on those dumb chairs,
bored stiff, wasting my time,
wasting my life.
That's all.
I didn't want to lie to you.
I don't understand.
Where were you?
The men's room.
I'm sure you went outside.
How can you be so sure?
Look in your hair.
This won't be tolerated.
I'm notifying the curator.
You're accused
of striking an officer.
Why did you do it?
I didn't do nothing, Ma'am.
I saved a poor bum
about to croak.
The cops, instead of taking him
to the hospital,
pull me in
for smoking in the subway.
It's crazy!
Sure I got a little worked up,
but it isn't my fault.
Let me explain.
It's 'cause of a guy,
one single guy!
It's this dude's fault.
He just sat there doing nothing.
I swear, all by himself...
Like the whole world
could have croaked around him!
I should have hit him,
not the cops.
That's it, Ma'am,
it isn't my fault.
I swear, what do you do
with guys like that?
They're criminals.
I didn't do nothing.
That's all I got to say.
You'll stand trial next week.
Meanwhile, you're free to go.
Here.
Fifth floor.
Shit!
We forgot flowers.
I hate coming empty-handed.
Be right back!
What're you thinking about?
Lots of things.
Thinking about me?
Sure, you most of all.
How's my sweetie?
Here he is.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Richard...
Mom.
Dad not home?
He's at the bar.
Excuse me...
Sorry, I didn't see you.
I'm the one who's sorry.
I'm transparent.
- What'll it be?
- Coffee.
It's going to rain.
No more sunshine.
Glum, eh?
What about the sun?
The sun!
Rain and more rain.
What crap...
You want the trees
to wither and die,
shrivel under the ultra-violets?
You want skin cancer?
Moron!
- Read your palm?
- No way!
You're like me.
You keep quiet
but your mind's working.
Like me, you expect
nothing more from life.
You feel alone and abandoned.
I'm by your side.
An old jerk 30 feet from you
that you never saw or heard,
is thinking about you.
Love, luck, fortune...
If you could read the future,
you'd have predicted
your sorry fate.
Now beat it!
Luck, love, fortune...
No, thanks.
Love and all that...
- I already heard.
- Show palm.
No, I said.
Don't bother.
No, I work here.
I'm not a customer.
Show palm...
Not want to know?
I know my fate.
I heard today's horoscope.
The restaurant's
been closed for ages.
It's a wild story.
It's a story about...
No, it's too long,
I don't have time.
It could make a good movie.
I'll have sweet vermouth, too.
Marc, my husband.
- Can I close the door?
- Sure.
I'm not eating.
I'll just have tea.
I'm waiting for someone
across the street.
"Your attention, please.
"Due to a suspicious package,
this train will skip the next stop."
I don't knowwhy she waited
till tonight to showyou off.
Isn't he handsome?
He sure is.
Show me your hands.
I first need to look
at a man's hands.
Well, I don't.
I need my glasses.
Where're my glasses?
In your bedroom.
No, they're in the kitchen.
What am I supposed
to say to him?
I'm hungry.
I wish we'd eat.
- Excuse me?
- What?
I said "excuse me" because...
I didn't hear what you said.
Just talking to myself.
No need to answer.
- Where's Rue Senard?
- How should I know!
So this is the one
who's so handsome,
so funny, so charming.
Looks like he's bored shitless.
More than bored,
he looks miserable.
That's it.
He looks so miserable
that I almost like him.
Something to drink?
I asked you earlier.
I went in the kitchen
and prepared you a little...
Damn!
I'm out of cigarettes.
Any tobacconist open?
The local one's closed.
- The cafe?
- He sells cigarettes.
Since you're going,
get me a pack of lights.
Any brand.
Sure.
- I'll give you money.
- Don't bother.
- Hurry back.
- Just be a sec, don't worry.
Be right back.
Bastard!
You bastard!
I can't believe it!
You can't do this...
Did you give him
the door code at least?
Give this to that man?
Him.
- Buy me one?
- She's nuts!
Try that one.
From the girl over there.
Thanks.
You're a gentleman,
not like him.
- What do you do?
- I'm in the restaurant business.
What sort of restaurant?
Italian.
Don't say you're ltalian!
Not working tonight?
I took the night off.
Business is bad.
- And I knewwe'd meet.
- What?
What's your line?
Dog trainer.
I do surveillance work.
Security guard.
- You seem surprised.
- A bit.
I haven't done it all my life.
I worked for a dry cleaner,
but the place folded.
Some Chinese bought it out.
The Chinese work
around the clock.
They have a different attitude.
At least they don't bug us,
unlike the Arabs.
We like to have fun.
Slitting girls' throats?
It's awful what
goes on in Algeria.
- You Algerian?
- Yeah.
I'm just teasing you a bit,
but I'm not mean.
I'm a nice girl, you'll see.
Give me change
for an instant lottery?
It's $3.
Train station...
Bastard!
He's swiping my bag!
Help!
I almost ran him over!
Good thing he's wearing yellow.
What does life boil down to?
Mine boils down to 3 things:
a clothespin, a kiwi,
a faucet joint.
I'm going out to look for him!
What can be taking him so long?
I wish I were like you.
I wish I were a dog.
You're making me lose.
You're bad luck.
Give me another $3.
Hello.
Did a man come in for cigarettes
a half-hour ago?
I see thousands of people a day.
He'd have to have something
special for me to notice a guy.
Give me a pack of lights.
Describe him?
He looks like...
He looks like he's not
where he should be.
How much?
$4.
It was way back,
at least 30 years ago.
I lived in a small place
on the fifth floor.
I was hanging out laundry
over the courtyard.
The clothespin broke,
my underwear fell below.
To get it back, I had to go
through the ground floor flat.
Which I did.
That's where I met my wife.
We married, had a kid.
When my son was 15,
he became a motor-cross freak.
We took him to races.
Once, just before a race,
my wife bought some kiwis.
This was before
they were popular.
I ate one, it made me sick.
We called the doctor,
he said it was an allergy.
The next day,
I couldn't take my son.
So my wife drove him.
They had an accident.
My son was killed instantly.
My wife survived.
She always blamed
me for his death.
She left me.
I went into a depression.
I lost my job.
So I decided to end it all.
I had lots of pills...
I knewthat if I took 10 grams
of aspirin and two antidepressants,
that would do it.
I stuffed them all in my mouth
and went to the sink
for a glass of water.
But as I later learned,
there was a leak
because of a bad joint,
and the mains
were turned off.
So there I was
with a mouthful of pills
and not a drop of water!
So I drank some oil
I found in the cupboard.
I threw it all up, naturally.
So there's no such thing
as chance.
I don't believe this!
I'm cold.
I'm hungry.
I don't care anyhow!
I won $15!
Going already?
Why?
I did what I had to do.
That way I keep
the ball rolling, see?
I rack up points.
I get a bonus.
Mister...
It's for you.
Why?
Because I want to win
the lottery.
That's all.
You bastard!
Oh, sorry.
You okay?
Shit!
Richard!
- What's wrong?
- Careful, it hurts.
What happened?
I cut my eyebrow.
They stitched me up.
I knew it!
Our son had a bad dream
last night.
It's incredible.
Little sister, bring me my bag.
Praise God,
you're back with us.
Look at this sand, Sonia.
I brought it from home,
from the desert.
Take some,
it will bring you luck.
