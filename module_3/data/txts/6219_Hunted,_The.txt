Ready? Here we go.
One, two, three, go!
No.
Okay, Daddy, you're up.
I found myself, Daddy.
All right, come here. All right.
Hi, Daddy!
Okay, okay.
The camera...
That's enough testing.
That's enough testing.
High fives. High fives.
Then them deer I shoot
on my BowTech Insanity.
A tree hugger, I spend most of my days
in a tree, so that makes me the original.
Spend most of my days in a tree,
so that makes me a tree hugger.
What the... what are you
doing sneaking up on me?
I thought you were
supposed to be the hunter.
I am a hunter.
That's ridiculous.
Where's your truck?
Stevie's riggin' it with cameras.
Oh...
What are you doing?
- Are you getting ready?
- I am.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Practicing your lines?
Yeah, I am, is that okay with you?
Now can you put that stuff down?
You're worse than the kids.
You're gonna be great.
Is that why you're laughing
at me? You're terrible.
I'm just messing with you,
you're gonna be great...
because we need you to.
You sure you're all right
with me doing this?
Yes.
Pinky swear.
I pinky swear.
All right, it's gonna
be good. I promise.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
So, uh... we have all
these cameras here.
What do you think?
We should make a home video.
- Come on.
- When you get back.
Oh, come on.
I don't want to interrupt
your focus... tree hugger.
Oh, I'll give you a tree to hug.
I got it.
I'm a genuine tree hugger.
A West, by God,
Virginian tree hugger.
Oh, that's terrible.
You know what? I should
host your hunting show.
Take your clothes off
and people might watch.
- That is a good idea.
- I'd just mute it.
You wouldn't be able to handle it.
Go ahead.
This is it, man, first episode.
I really appreciate you
doing this, brother.
I got a lot riding on it, man.
Of course. What is that?
Buck semen.
Oh, god.
Well, you gotta Christen this thing and it
seemed more appropriate than champagne.
If Goocher will get this on the
Outdoor Channel, I'll buy one dozen.
- Come on.
- I got it, man, you can put it away.
No, no, no, here you go.
Put it away, man,
that smells like shit.
It would, it's buck semen.
Not to mention, I quit my job.
Oh, yeah, then there's
that, right? No pressure.
It's all good, dude. My wife loves
seeing you pull into the driveway.
You know, she says we work
best when I'm gone, right?
Why do you think I was a camera man for
the 11:00 news? Never home when she was.
We're here for three days?
Yeah, three days, most hunting shows get
what they need in that amount of time,
so I think we'll be good.
We'll get what we need.
Bucks only, right?
Yeah, bucks are the ones
with the horns on them.
Yeah, I got that.
Hold on a second. Turn it up.
<i>A low pressure system over Webster County
will bring periods of rain and a few spot...</i>
<i>Low 60's during the day, dropping
down to a chilly 30 degrees at night.</i>
<i>- Currently it's a breezy 61 degrees...</i>
- Look at that.
Yay, we're getting close now.
I mean, we're in the middle
of the boonies down here.
You've never been here before?
No. I've known Tony for a while,
but it's my first time here now.
Give me one set.
All right, when we get down here,
Tony will walk out and meet us.
My thought is we just stay
on Tony, okay? Make it easier.
You can just give us a quick hello, here we
are, let's get going type of thing, okay?
- All right.
- Don't even put anything on it.
You don't have to be Marlon Brando.
You don't even have
to be Kevin Sorbo.
All right, so I'll let you out here.
Looks like you found it.
We did. You order up this rain?
Ah, it's just a little bit. We'll turn it
off in a minute. How was the trip?
Not too bad, a little long,
but we made it. Glad to be here.
- Glad to have you.
- I really appreciate you doing this.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.
- We're ready to get up a tree.
All right, well let's get your stuff
and get you out in the woods.
Sounds good. That good?
- Perfect.
- That mean I can cuss now?
- It does.
- Let's get your shit, man.
- So, you Stevie, huh?
- Yes, sir.
You're the big news
camera man from the big city?
- That's me.
- You ever been hunting before?
Yeah, a little bit, as a kid,
but first time with a camera.
Well, you'll never be able
to kill anything with that.
You guys need any help?
Boys, this is Jessi.
Jessi, this is Jake, Stevie.
This is a hands-off
proposition right here.
You might want to talk
to him about that.
This is a hands-off
proposition right here.
- Yes, sir, understood.
- It was nice to meet you, guys.
We're rolling.
Good.
This new piece should be real good.
Nobody's hunted it. We just
got the lease on the property.
It looks really good.
It sits right up next to the
piece where we saw Movie Star.
Who's that?
- Movie Star, he's the big boy we're after.
- How'd he get that name?
It's because the only way anybody's
ever seen him is in pictures.
Trail camera photos is it.
But you're not allowed to kill him.
If you see him,
you gotta let him walk.
Oh, now come on.
I need to make money off
of him for a little while longer.
Aw, shit.
Tree stands are all set up,
waiting for you.
I am gonna charge you for the labor
of hanging those things up there.
- Out of your paycheck.
- Yeah, I figured.
Jake tells me you never hunted out
of a tree stand before, is that right?
I never have.
Well, we hung 'em up about
20 feet off the ground.
Yeah, I think I should be
fine once I'm up there.
Right?
I hope you will.
Callaway and I went back in there
a couple weeks ago about noon.
Hung the tree stands. We download
the photos from the trail cameras,
- haven't been a soul back in there since.
- That sounds good.
You'll want to check those
cameras when you get up there.
We will.
Goddamn, Jake, you think you
boys got enough cameras?
He's got big cameras and little cameras
and remote controls for cameras.
- Looks to me you're just about set.
- Oh, yeah.
All right, so, remember, once you forward
the river look for the orange ribbons,
- that's where you park.
- All right.
Then you're going to
go across that field...
cut to the big, brick chimney
in the middle of it.
- And that's the Prudy Place?
- Right, that's the old Prudy Place.
Then when you get on the other
side, look for the ribbons again.
Pick 'em up, that'll take
you right into the stand.
It sounds good.
- See you when we get back.
- Kill a big 'un.
Weather changing on a
dime around here, isn't it?
First it rains, then the sun shines, I bet
it's gonna rain again before the day is over.
I remember this road just runs right
up along the river the whole way.
Look at that.
Let me set the camera.
That will be a cool shot.
Back here looking up
this way while we cross.
I saw some good stuff on Solo Hunters
and some other hunting shows.
We can do a lot of cool stuff.
I'm gonna follow you with a camera.
I can lead you with a camera.
I can also run ahead
and place the camera
so they can film us approaching
walking past them.
- Long way back in here, ain't it?
- Sure is.
Hey, Jake, let's get a bit
before we get going. That cool?
Just set up like right there.
- You got the camera set?
- Yeah, one sec.
- You like this one over here?
- That one's ready, this is ready.
- It's on you, bud.
- All right.
Here we are. We're about five
country miles from the lodge,
which puts us about 30...
I'm gonna take that back.
I'm gonna push in.
- You good?
- Yeah, we're good.
All right.
Well, here we are.
We're about five country
miles from the lodge...
which puts us about 30 miles by the
way a crow flies from anywhere else.
The road was a little
rough getting in here...
but thanks to Lockard's down in Flatwoods,
this Ranger got us here safe and sound.
We're pretty pumped to be huntin'
here with Calloway Outfitters...
because we've seen pretty amazing
photos on the trail cams.
So let's get in the stand
and see what we can find.
Perfect.
Good?
Nice.
Here's the Prudy Place.
That old chimney is cool, right?
It is a good shot.
Cut.
It's opening day of bow
season here in West Virginia.
Some weather has moved in
on us, but that's all right...
we're excited to be here
with Calloway Outfitters.
The bucks are far from
chasing the does,
but we still feel pretty
good about this spot.
We know there's a monster
buck cruising this area...
so I got somebody I want to introduce
him to... my BowTech Insanity.
She's hungry and I'm
dying to let her feed.
I spend most of my days up in a tree,
so I guess that makes me a tree hugger...
a genuine tree hugger... a West,
by God, Virginia tree hugger.
It's time to hunt.
Great, that was great.
Was that good?
- Great.
- All right.
What the hell is that?
It's the fan.
That'll scare everything off.
What kind of camera is that?
This is a good, damn camera,
don't you worry about that.
David Fincher shoots on this camera.
Who's David Fincher?
He's a director, directed Fight Club.
Oh, yeah, that was
a pretty good movie.
Needed more fighting in it,
though. Good movie, though.
Let's get settled in.
I see him.
Where's the bucks?
They didn't like something.
We're gonna lose
daylight in a minute.
- What the hell was that?
- Turn on the light. Turn on the light.
- How?
- Up top, in the front.
Go, go, I got it, I got it, I got it.
What the hell was that, man?
Which direction was it coming from?
Ssh.
- What the hell was that?
- Just listen.
Holy shit.
Ssh, just listen.
What was that?
I don't know.
It sounded like a woman
screaming her damn head off.
I know, it did, right?
Yeah.
I can't hear anything now.
That sounded like it was down
at the bottom by the river.
Think it could have been Tony?
Tony? No, Tony wouldn't
ruin our hunting like that.
You know what that was?
What?
That was a friggin' cat.
What?
A bobcat, you ever
hear a bobcat scream?
No.
They say a bobcat scream sounds
just like a freakin' woman.
All my years of hunting,
I never heard that before.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.
I tell you what...
let's slip up around the field.
I wanna go check those trail
camera's before we head in.
See what's been cruisin'
through this area.
I'm gonna keep that rolling in case it
does it again, so we can catch it. Okay?
Yeah.
You don't hear that in the
city very often, do you?
If I do, it's a woman.
That's never a good thing.
I don't imagine so.
We sent a couple of these Leupold
Trail Camera's to Tony a while back...
to hang for us, so we could track
what was moving through the area.
Now the great thing
about this system is...
is you can plug your viewer
directly into your camera...
and download all your photos
and videos right here in the field.
Or you can just sit here
and view them as well.
That easy and it's done.
It's the perfect set-up. All right
then, let's go check the other one.
What is it?
You hear something?
Look at this.
Whoa.
Whoever made that,
that's who we're looking for.
Bucks will take their front hooves and
they'll clear out all the leaves...
and sticks and everything
right down to the dirt.
They'll make it nice and big
so the other deer will see it.
They stand over and drop their scent in
there to let all the other bucks know...
that this is my territory, this is where
I'm gonna breed. This is my spot.
And with our trail
camera right there...
I betcha a dollar we
got a picture of him.
Man, this is a great
spot for a buck to be.
There's so much cover down
through there. It's so thick.
Yeah. Got a wore out, too.
Man, I'm not so sure that we're in
the right place with our stands.
We might wanna think
about coming in here.
The other stand set up is
right down here somewhere.
It may be a little bit
longer walk in, but...
Let's get out of here before
we disturb them too much.
Where's my knife?
Leave me your jacket out here,
to keep them as scent-free as possible.
Did I lose that frickin' thing?
I don't know, buddy. Maybe you dropped
it coming in and out of the stand.
I heard what you said and
I want you to walk away.
I told you!
He looked happy.
All right, buddy, listen, so we're
gonna do a quick walk and talk.
We'll talk to the people, ask them
about their hunt type thing, okay?
Yeah.
I might go ahead and set
this camera up, okay?
Yeah.
Just walk down the middle, I'm gonna
shoot right over your shoulder.
Ready?
I smell dinner.
Well, there's Jordan and the
Norba guest. You boys doing good?
I've seen a shooter, just couldn't get
him in range. You guys have any luck?
No... coming back for dinner, right?
Yeah, we're gonna drop our
stuff, be back in a few minutes.
All right.
The television stars have returned.
How's that new piece of property?
Anything exciting happen up there?
We didn't see much. Heard a bobcat
or something scream at dark, though.
Did you?
Yeah, I got a little concerned
for Stevie there for a minute.
It scare you, did it, Stevie?
Like a woman screaming
bloody murder.
Now they won't bother you, if you
don't try to have sex with them.
- We did find a huge scrape, though.
- Oh, they at it already, huh?
Oh, yeah. Right smack in front of that trail
camera, couldn't have been in a better spot.
Makes me wonder where
you got 'em all tied up at.
Only if you pay me to take you hunting and
I'll show you where I got 'em tied up at.
I'm not sure I want to know what
you have tied up in these woods.
- Shit.
- Hey, what was with that guy out front?
It's nothing, he's just upset because we got
that new piece of property you're hunting.
- What? He want to hunt it, too?
- Yeah.
He can have it if it's gonna
be like it was tonight.
Everybody wants to hunt it.
We're still hoping
you're gonna hunt it.
I'm depending on you to make sure
everybody knows it's a good place to hunt!
Man, I hope there's
something on here.
Because I'm not gonna lie to you,
I'm a little discouraged after today.
What have we got?
That's not what we're looking for.
Skunk.
Nope.
Raccoon.
No.
Possum?
No.
Another raccoon.
Nope.
- Come on now.
- What?
Ow, what?
That is what we're
freaking looking for!
Hello, Movie Star.
Oh, wow.
That, folks, is the
grandaddy of these woods.
Tony has been telling me about
him for over a year now.
This is the only place you
see him, never in person.
He's like a freaking ghost.
Whoa, he is massive.
Damn straight he is.
Look at him mug for the camera.
Come on, Movie Star, I want
to put you in my movie.
I'll make you famous.
You got that?
Well...
it's about 5:00 AM.
I like to get to the stand a
good hour or so before daylight.
So we can get up and get settled in.
Catch those deer moving from
their food to their beds.
Put the sneak attack on.
- Did you do that?
- No.
I didn't do that. Why would
I stick my knife in a tree?
- Did you have it out?
- I don't think so.
There it is. There it is.
Don't move.
Did you get that?
Yeah, I got it, man. And it
sounds exactly like a damn woman.
It's moving away.
That's a cat.
Jesus Christ, Jake, I've never
heard anything like that.
We gotta go look, man,
we gotta go check.
What do you mean?
What if someone's out there?
What if someone's hurt?
That's a cat. My old man
used to say that when...
You'd stand straight up if you heard
one of them pussies screaming at you.
I don't know, man, that sounds
far too much like a person to me.
People don't hang around in the
woods in the middle of nowhere...
screaming and crying
all night. Animals do.
I mean, come on, you were an investigative
news cameraman. Think about it.
I mean, if someone were hurt or in trouble,
don't you think they'd be yelling for help?
And that sound moves,
it doesn't stay in the same place.
We heard it at dark and before daylight.
I mean, that's when animals move.
I know.
- Right?
- Right.
It's gone now.
What I want to know is how my
knife got stuck in that tree.
I want to go check.
Where are the deer?
We gotta shoot the morning intro stuff.
Let's go ahead and do that right now.
I'm not gonna be able to sit
here all day without checking.
All right, just wait for the camera.
I'm gonna pan through the
woods and find you, okay?
Here we are, it's Morning 2.
We had a couple of does move
through right before daylight,
but we checked the trail camera.
We know that Movie Star is
moving through this area.
We've got a front moving in, so that
should get the deer up on their feet.
Get that big boy moving.
I like our chances.
I want to go check.
You've got to be kidding me,
we just got here.
I know.
We'll stay on the river, be less
likely to jump anything that way.
We'll go a few hundred yards
and glass both sides good.
We wouldn't have heard anything
if it were any further than that.
Stay close and keep quiet.
Don't make a lot of movement.
If there was something
here, it'll be close.
Be careful. Watch your step.
I thought we'd find something.
I don't see any need
to go any further.
Let's get back to the stand.
Whoa, whoa.
That's blood.
Something was dragged
off the hill right there.
Here, take this.
That's a lot of blood.
Whatever it was,
must have gone in the river.
Jake!
Jesus Christ. Look at its face, man.
What the hell could have done that?
Could have been a
coyote or another cat.
They got big coon down
here by the river.
Well, that's what we heard this morning
right there was that thing getting whipped.
There's your screamer,
or was your screamer.
Let's get back to the stand.
You just want to leave it?
You want to bring it with you?
Damn it.
You all right, bud? You get
the wind knocked out of you?
Yeah.
Jake?
Damn it, I hate that shit
more than anything. Damn it.
What the hell happened?
The damn ladder broke.
Did they break?
It ain't broke.
Even if it were loose,
it wouldn't come unhooked.
Well, how the hell
did they come apart?
The only way they come
apart is if you unhook them.
We are on the right side
of the property, right?
If the river is the property line,
and this field is Calloway's.
I hope to hell if someone didn't want
us here, they'd come and tell us...
and not unhook our damn ladder
so we'd fall and break our neck.
What's your investigative
intuition tell you about this one?
These crows have all the
answers, don't they?
That's a deer. There's a deer.
He's coming out.
It's a buck.
That's a shooter. That's a shooter.
Where? I don't see it.
He's right there!
You got him?
Where?
He's up the right hand side.
He's right at the edge of the tree line.
I don't have him in frame.
He's 57 yards... that's Movie
Star. That's Movie Star.
Do it. Do it.
Shoot.
Damn it, I don't have a shot.
He's not moving. How do you not?
There's a branch in the way.
I need him to take a step.
He's gotta take a step.
- Oh, he's turning back.
- What?
I gotta let down.
No, no, no, he's moving
back into the woods.
No.
Damn it.
That's a freaking buck, man.
That's a freaking buck.
So close, man. Not a freaking shot.
Of course, damn it,
I should have shot.
I have a shot, and you
don't have him in frame.
And then when you do,
I can't freaking shoot.
The one place he stops,
he stops right behind that snag.
That was our show right there.
Relax. You still got another day.
Damn.
It better pick up.
Two weeks ago, there was 20-30 head of
deer in this field every freaking evening.
With those acorns falling, they ain't
going in, they're staying in the woods.
I'm so stupid, we should have gone
to the other stands in the woods.
You think that's where they are?
That's where they gotta be,
they gotta be staying in.
That many deer can't just disappear.
Damn it.
We gotta move that other set-up.
We gotta move the other stands.
It's just like you ripped my freaking
heart out of my chest... that much more.
Horse's balls.
We'll sit here 'til dark.
We'll give it about 30 minutes after and
we'll move. We'll go to those other stands.
Ready when ever you are, man.
Hold on, I got the stand unhooked.
Top stand or the bottom stand?
Top.
What was wrong with it?
Just wasn't a good
filming angle, hold on.
- Oh, fuck.
- Ssh.
Stay there, stay there! Don't step
on the stand! It's not hooked up.
It's coming right to us.
It's coming right to the light.
I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
You still think that was a cat?
That camera is gonna d...
Whoa, whoa.
Nothing.
Everytime we heard that thing, it sounded
like it was moving along this road.
So let's put a trail
camera on that tree...
and anything comes through here
will set the motion sensor off,
and we'll get a picture of it.
It had to have been just out of
your camera light, whatever it was.
There's no way there
was nothing there.
All right, we'll talk to Tony,
but let's do it upstairs, okay?
All right.
Can't wait to hear what
he has to say about this.
I know, right?
Damn! What the hell?
If you boys knew what was good for
you, you'd not go back down there.
What's your problem, pal? Damn.
What was that?
I'm telling you,
there was nothing there.
There wasn't... that close
I would have seen it.
I don't know what to tell you boys.
Jake, you know, you said it yourself,
you spend a lifetime in the woods...
sooner or later something's gonna
come around and surprise you.
But I tell you what I do know.
That video you got of the
big boy, that right there...
being that close, seeing him with
your own eyes... that's hunting.
That's what you gotta
keep your mind on.
That's the reason you came here,
bringing down Movie Star.
You saw a dead cat.
You probably heard another one.
I listened to your story,
I watched your video.
But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I just don't believe in that stuff.
Your imagination is always a lot scarier than
anything you'll find out there in the dark.
What about the knife?
What about the ladder coming undone?
Do you think there's any shot this
guy might be screwing with us?
No, I don't, son,
because it's my property.
Now if I was you two boys, I'd be
right back out there tomorrow.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I gotta hit it. I'm tired.
I'm gonna get some sleep,
I'd advise you boys to do the same.
I don't believe him.
I mean, he talked an awful lot about
ghosts until the camera was on him.
He talked about a story he heard a long
time ago that he could barely remember.
He also said he
doesn't believe in it.
Seemed pretty sure about it to me.
Why would he lie about it? Why?
I mean, hell, if you don't believe in Santa
Claus, you don't believe in Santa Claus.
I mean, he also said that when we
leave out of here tomorrow night...
that he'd have clients
in there the next day.
Of course, he did, Jake.
It's more money for him. Right?
But you're telling me that he
didn't hear anything up there?
I think he would have
told us if he did.
He was in there at noon, in and out.
Well, he sure clammed up when he
saw that video, I'll tell you that much.
Bro, there's just too much going
on for nobody to know nothing.
Why do you have a hair
up your ass about him?
Think about this. It doesn't serve him
at all to keep something from us.
It only helps him if we kill a big buck on
his property. That's good business for him.
We didn't come here to chase some
freaking half-baked ghost story.
We came here to kill a big buck,
and that's what we're gonna do.
I need this freaking show on the air.
That's how we're gonna get it.
Okay.
Are we going hunting in the morning?
- Yes.
- All right.
Now damn it, I miss my wife,
so I'm gonna go call her.
We got a long walk in the morning...
so let's get some sleep, all right?
Roger that.
Hey, babe.
I thought I'd record this
and e-mail it to you...
because I know you're
missing my pretty face.
Plus, I'm all by my lonesome,
so I can talk dirty to you.
Stevie's said he was gonna
download today's footage, so...
Okay, you want me to
just talk about it? Okay.
- Just talk.
- Okay.
It's so funny that anyone else has
ever heard this. Um, okay, so...
Our grandpa was the one who used to tell
us that there was a ghost of a woman...
that walked up and down
the road way up the holler
at what they call the
Prudy Place, screaming.
Now that's the chimney that
stands straight up in the field.
Right, yeah.
Okay, so the story went that her
husband was real bad to abuse her.
This is pretty good, actually,
we should do this more often.
Because then I get to talk about hunting
and you can't... you can't cut me off.
Well, I guess you could turn
it off if you wanted, right?
How are you? How's the kids?
You good? They good?
I miss you. This hasn't
been the easiest.
Hunting with a camera
is a whole other world.
It's hard.
Plus, it's... the weather, it's...
Sun shines or rain pours, it's warm during
the day, cold as balls at night, but...
After years of abuse, and living in fear,
she finally did go crazy. She lost it.
People would see her walking
up and down the road crying.
She'd scream at them for never
believing her, never helping her.
Whoa.
So finally, one day,
her husband got drunk...
and had done a bunch of unmentionable
things to her and then passed out.
So she took a shotgun,
shut the house up...
nailed the doors and windows
shut with him in it...
and set the place on fire,
burned it to the ground.
When the neighbors saw
smoke and came to help...
and found out that he was locked
up in there they tried to save him.
Like this evening, we did get a taste
of who's the boss of these woods.
All my years, and you hear stories...
anybody that's ever spent any
amount of time in the woods.
Don't worry, babe, it's gonna work.
But we know there's
a monster out there.
You know, where were
they when I needed them?
So she laid into them
with a shotgun...
then went down by the river
and put the gun in her mouth.
- She committed suicide?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god.
- It's crazy, right?
Jessi, I got hairs standing
up on the back of my neck.

<i>I mean, I think that's the big reason
why Tony wanted the property so bad.</i>
<i>Because no one's ever in there anymore.
Makes a perfect place to hunt.</i>
<i>Let me ask you, did you
guys ever hear this thing?</i>
<i>No, not me, mm-mm. I mean after...</i>
- Hey.
- Damn it! That's not cool, man.
Sorry, dude, sorry, man,
I didn't mean to scare you.
- What's up?
- You done with the download?
Yeah, man, I'm done, I'm done.
Well, we better hit it.
All right, man, have a good night.
- Good?
- Good.
What do you think, Bud,
you ready to do this?
Oh, I'm ready.
Then you know what I say we do?
I say we go find this big, ugly buck, and I
send an arrow flying at this big, ugly buck.
Put it right behind his shoulder, right
to his pump house, rendering it useless.
I like that...
because I'm gonna have my little
moving picture takers up and running...
and I'm gonna take little moving pictures
of his pump house being shot wide open...
like Connie Costello's legs on
the desk of the F and B office.
I totally forgot you were with
her. What were you thinking?
What's wrong with that? What?
She was fine was I was there.
When you were there, you say that like
you were there on vacation or something.
Right? The Grand Canyon.
More like the Mohave Desert.
Ugh, you ready?
Ready and raring, bud.
Don't go down there!
Let's just do that morning
intro stuff right here.
Let's do it here in the Ranger?
Yeah.
Well, here we are, it's our last
day here with Calloway Outfitters.
We know there's a monster in
here and we've had him close.
But we needed just a little bit more
luck to put that boy on the ground.
But I think we can get it done today.
I feel good about it.
We'll go get him,
and we'll go get him good.
Let's go hunting.
That's good.
That's good?
What?
There's something walking.
What is it?
That doesn't sound like a deer.
I don't hear it anymore.
I don't know. Let's get ready.
Don't let me forget that
trail camera this evening.
Okay.
Let's go.
Hey, I want to go check the
trail cam before we climb in.
You want me to take your stuff up?
No, it's okay, I'll get
it when we get back.
I'll just be a few minutes.
We got a little time.
Listen, go ahead and take
this up with you, okay?
Get some B-roll while
you're out there.
It should be fully charged.
There, good to go.
Okay, go ahead and climb
up and get set in, all right?
Okay.
Don't forget to hook
your spider harness.
Yeah, I got it.
There they are, there's the eyes.
We've been having some interesting
activity in here. So I want to come...
and check out the Leupold Trail Camera
and see if there's anything on it.
What the hell?
Wait a second. Where the hell is it?
I'll be damned.
Now here's that trail camera.
And it was on that tree,
30 feet over there.
Where are you, Jake?
What happened?
I spooked a deer.
Trail cam wasn't on the tree.
What was it?
Could have been a lot of things.
Turn that light off.
I don't believe this.
I can't believe it's this slow.
I know, right? I would have thought at least
a couple of doe would come through here.
We've only got, little more
than a half a day left...
and all we got is me
pulling back on a buck.
I don't think we have enough
footage, not for a 22-minute show.
Well, I plan on getting a
shit-ton of B-roll today.
I also think we should shoot at dusk,
so we can include it with the stuff...
when you pulled back on that
big one. Just stretch it out.
What do you mean?
Just something we can
cut in with, you know?
We used to make up all sorts of shit on
the news. Makes for an interesting story.
That's great. That's comforting.
If we need it,
I also spoke with Jessi.
What do you mean?
I asked her about the ghost.
She talked about it.
- On camera.
- Yeah.
- Why would you do that?
- In case we needed it.
If Tony wouldn't talk
about it on camera...
what makes you think he'd want one
of his employees talking about it?
We can cut in with it, all I'm
saying is we have it if we need it.
No, we're not gonna do that,
we'd look like a couple of jack asses.
No, all it does is corroberates the
footage we already have, okay?
That way we don't
look like we're crazy.
Tony would be so pissed off.
Not to mention you'd get Jessi fired.
We're not gonna do that.
We came here to kill a buck and
that's what we're going to do.
That's what we're filming, all right?
This is miserable. This is
just the icing on the cake.
I know.
Just frickin' rain...
There's nothing.
What do you think?
Who knows, it must have
been moving all night.
Must have been it.
I bet if you checked the trail camera,
they'd be all over it from last night.
You want me to check?
If you want to.
I just hope we have enough to
show the program and people
at least what our show
would look like, you know?
You know what I mean?
- There's something out there, man.
- What, what?
- And whatever it is, does not want us here.
- Ssh, what are you talking about?
- I want to go, okay?
- Hey, hey, ssh.
I want to leave and I
want to leave right now.
What's wrong? What are
you talking about?
- Look at this. See that?
- What am I looking at?
I'm gonna scroll back. Look at that...
look at that sapling, okay?
Keep your voice down.
I'm gonna scroll back, and then I'm gonna
scroll forward. You see that? Explain that.
I don't know, man, it's probably...
It's not a bobcat, okay? It's not a bobcat
and it's not the wind, okay? I'm done.
- You see that? You see that?
- It's probably just...
- The sapling goes to the ground.
- All right, calm down.
I'm sorry, man. I know how much this meant
to you. I know how much you had riding on this.
- But I'm done, I don't do ghosts.
- All right, all right...
First the ladder comes undone? Right?
You could have broken your neck.
Stevie, we don't know what that was.
Exactly! We don't know what that was
and that's exactly why I'm leaving.
Look at that? You see that?
What are you doing?
First two are fine, right?
And notice the sapling.
Stevie, what... come on,
what are you doing?
It moves, explain that to me. Huh?
Huh? And then it bounces back.
So something, unseen, I might add, takes
that sapling, and moves it to the ground.
And then it bounces
right back to normal,
and here's the best part.
What triggered the sensor?
There was nothing to trigger the sensor,
right? And look at these last two.
There's a flare, there's a goddamn
flare right there, right?
How is there a goddamn
flare when it's dark outside?
That was not a bobcat, okay?
That was not a bobcat.
You okay? In the news,
they tell you to stay alert
and know what makes for
compelling footage.
So whatever you do, keep filming.
You hear me? And put this on.
Listen, do you hear that?
There was nothing,
there was nothing. Come on.
What the...
What the hell?
Who the hell did this?
This is not good, man.
I don't see any footprints.
Get the viewer.
I got it!
I'm starting to get pissed off now.
Someone is screwing with us?
Come and mess with us now!
You fucking punks! I hope you
smiled, because you're on camera!
Here we go, this is
from this morning.
Wait, what set the motion sensor off?
What the hell? There's nothing there!
No, no, no, no, look at the time.
Right, that's when we got here.
What's throwing this shit out?
I don't know.
Jake, this isn't happening.
How's it flying out?
I don't know.
That's what I heard this
morning. I heard that.
It was here when we were here.
Oh, damn it, are you all right?
We gotta go.
- Where's the key?
- What?
I always leave the key
in here. Did you take it?
I don't have it, man.
Why would I have it?
Check your pockets. I don't have the
key, why would I have the damn key?
Damn it!
This isn't happening.
Let's find the key
and get out of here.
It's five miles down that road.
That's five miles down the river and that's
exactly where it sounds like it's coming from.
And the keys are gone.
How the hell are the keys gone?
Let's just stay calm.
If it were gonna hurt us, I think it would
have, so let's just walk down the road.
No, I'm not going down the road, man.
You want to just wait here? Let me go get
the truck and come back and get you?
Listen to me, okay?
We're gonna cross the river.
We're gonna go over the ridge
until it leads us to the road.
The road just wraps
around this point.
You want to lug all this
stuff up over that hill?
We'll take the camera equipment,
we'll come back for the rest.
Damn it, Jake, let's go.
Aw, damn... all right.
Can't see a damn thing.
Looks like a good a place
as any, doesn't it?
I don't know.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Are you coming?
Yeah.
Keep up! Come on!
Right.
You gotta stay close.
I know.
Back up. Let's go back!
Jake! Are you okay?
How did it know which
way we were going?
Let's go!
Where are the keys, man?
Where are the goddamn keys?
I don't have the keys.
I know you have them, Jake!
Listen, I need you to calm
down, all right? Stay calm.
We're gonna walk down this road.
We're gonna walk out of here, okay?
Come on.
Come on.
What?
Listen.
Did you hear that?
That sounds heavy.
That's a deer.
Go, go, go, go!
Go!
Stop. It's me.
- It's hunting us.
- Stevie.
It knows. How did it know we
were gonna cross that ridge?
It knows, man, it lived here. It knows this
place. She lived at the Prudy Place, man.
- Stevie, stop, just stop.
- Jessi told me.
Run, man. Run.
Stevie, ssh, goddamn it.
Stevie!
Stevie! Where are you!
- Stevie!
- Stop screaming.
She's gonna hear you.
Where are you, man?
Stevie!
Don't do it, Jake.
Stevie!
Stevie!
- Stevie!
- Ssh!
Stevie! Where are you?
Be quiet, she's gonna hear you.
Perfect, it worked. It worked.
Oh, shit.
Stevie!
Stevie!
Stevie!
Stevie!
Just yell out!
Stevie! Damn!
Stevie!
What the hell?
Stevie.
Stevie, is that you?
Stevie. Stevie.
<i>- Stevie! Stevie!</i>
- Whoa, whoa, right there.
<i>Perfect. It worked. It worked.</i>
No, no. Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I can't find Stevie.
I can't find him.
Jake.
Jake.
Stevie?
Where are you?
Stevie?
