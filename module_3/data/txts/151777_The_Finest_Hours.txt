this is where they asked us
to meet? (LAUGHING)
BERNIE: Yeah.
What do you mean?
GUS: (GASPS)
Oh, I think I see her.
BERNIE: Where?
GUS: Oh, that's gotta be her.
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)
So, what are we gonna do?
Are we gonna grab
a milkshake, Bernie?
Is that why we're here?
BERNIE: Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
GUS: All right. You're gonna
owe me big for this.
(CLEARS THROAT)
So...
(WHISTLES)
You think I should have worn
the other shirt?
You look nice. (LAUGHS)
I don't know, Gus.
Maybe, she...
What if she don't like
the look of me or something?
Bernie. Come on.
Are you serious?
What about her?
Aren't you dying to see
what she looks like?
She could be a dog.
No, she isn't a dog.
(SCOFFS) She could be.
I already know what
she looks like in my head.
- She ain't a dog.
- (SNICKERS)
So, uh...
You been talking to her for
weeks on the phone, right?
- Yeah.
- Right?
Yeah.
(CAR DOOR OPENS)
She likes you
from talking to you, Bernie.
And I don't think
you gotta worry about her...
getting a good look at ya.
That ain't never
been your problem.
Let's go.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
(KNOCKS ON WINDOW) Come on.
Should have worn
the other shirt.
(GUS EXHALES)
(GUS BLOWING)
I'm the one taking a risk.
Doubling with some girl
I ain't never even spoke to...
let alone seen!
I don't know
why this Miriam girl...
says it's gotta be a double
date, anyway. (LAUGHS)
Maybe she's not
sure about me yet.
How can anybody
not be sure about you, Bernie?
Yeah. Thanks, Gus.
Yeah, hey,
don't tell none of the guys...
down at the station
about this.
It's not like you've
never been on a date before.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
- CATHERINE: All set there?
- Uh...
Excuse me.
Are you Miriam?
No. (LAUGHS)
I'm her friend.
She's, uh...
Hi. How you doin'? I'm Gus.
- Catherine.
- It's nice to meet you.
(LAUGHS)
Okay. We'll talk later.
(CHUCKLES) Bye.
Hi.
Wait.
You are Bernie Webber, right?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm Bernie.
(LAUGHS)
GUS: Hey, you two,
let's go grab a drink.
Yeah.
You wanna go?
Sure.
How you doin'? I'm Gus.
You know,
for a minute there...
I thought it was
Smokey the Bear...
makin' a call in that booth.
(STAMMERS)
'Cause of your jacket.
Oh. (LAUGHS)
CATHERINE: Bernie...
Miriam's never been on a boat.
She's scared of the water.
Has she never?
I told her I don't know how...
she's gonna date a guy
in the Coast Guard.
I'm not scared.
I live on the Cape.
Don't worry, Miriam.
You know, we, uh...
We all get scared out there.
I'm not afraid
of the water, Bernie.
It scares me at night,
that's all.
You can't see
what's underneath.
Just more water.
(CHUCKLES)
(UPBEAT 1950s MUSIC PLAYING)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
GUS: You know, I get funnier
as the night goes on.
So, why, uh... Why didn't you
wanna meet me for a date?
Why'd you...
Why'd you wait so long?
I didn't know if you'd be a...
If I'd what?
- You know.
- No.
You're so handsome...
I just didn't know
if you'd be attracted to me.
Oh, God, no, Miriam.
You're exactly
how I pictured you.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Better.
(LAUGHS)
You know... (CLEARS THROAT)
My brother, uh...
He always says that, "When
you know, you just know."
Which one?
Uh, all of it.
I guess, you know, everything.
No. I mean, which brother?
Oh. (SIGHS) Ay...
Uh, Paul. My brother, Paul.
He's the one who fought
over in Germany, right?
In Germany, yeah.
He's the oldest.
Father's favorite.
All three of my brothers
went over to the war.
He's your father's what?
(GUS LAUGHING)
GUS: Hey.
We should get Miriam
out on a boat tonight.
What do you say, Bernie, hmm?
We take out the dory.
It'll be fantastic.
You know
we can't do that, Gus.
We could get in trouble.
Come on, Bernie. It'll be fun.
Rules are rules.
No. (LAUGHS)
We don't gotta row out far.
Just so this sweet girl
can say...
she's been on a boat,
that's it.
A rowboat? No.
(SCOFFS) No.
No, no. Small boats that...
How about one of those bigger
boats? Tied up to the dock?
If Bernie's with me,
I'll do it.
GUS: Oh, a fishing boat?
(LAUGHS)
Those fishermen
don't want us around...
unless we're pullin' them in.
They think they own
the goddamn water.
- (CATHERINE LAUGHS)
- They're not very nice.
Come on. Don't be
such a fathead, Miriam.
Yeah.
Let's go out on the dory.
What's there to be afraid of?
(WHISPERS)
What's underneath, right?
Hey there, Mr. Stello.
How's it goin'?
- Hey, Bernie.
- Mr. Ryder.
Hey, so you see that girl
sitting over there?
The one with the coat
looks like a bear, Bernie?
- Yeah.
- Can't miss her.
I said the same thing myself.
Funny you should say that.
Looks like Smokey, right?
Smokey the Bear.
I don't know
no Smokey, Bernie.
Oh, it's just a cartoon.
Anyway, Mr. Stello,
she thinks...
she's scared of
going out on a boat.
And I don't think
we should row out on a dory.
I don't want her gettin' sick
on that nice, big coat.
So, I was wondering if...
So, you wanna take her on
the Anna G round the harbor?
Yeah.
CARL: Can't row out
on that dory
even if ya wanted,
right, Bernie?
- Carl, stop.
- Year anniversary's coming.
My sister's now
livin' in my house.
How's it going
with you, Bernie?
That's enough, Carl.
He did all he could.
I am sorry, Mr. Nickerson.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Just wanted to
ask Mr. Stello...
about borrowing a boat.
- GUS: Got you. I got you.
- (CATHERINE LAUGHS)
This is a boat. (LAUGHS)
BERNIE: Give me your hands.
- It's okay.

That's the Fort Mercer.

She's a big lady.
She's a T2 tanker.
Started radioin'
a couple hours ago.
Apparently she's got
a big crack in her hull.
It's spillin' oil
all over the place.
She's, uh, about 20 miles east
off of Nantucket.
It sounds like Boston
and Nantucket...
are sendin' out
their entire fleet, huh?
We could be next.
They're saying
gale force winds...
50 to 60 miles per hour.

Webber. Pick yourself a crew.
Go out there,
help them fishermen...
secure their boats
to the pier.
Oh. Uh, yes, sir.
Sir, I need to
ask you a question.
Uh...
I need permission about
a girl, you know?
Permission?
Permission... For a girl?
FITZGERALD: Mr. Cluff,
it's working.
Yes, sir.
Not now, Webber.

Not now, Webber.
We're back up.

It's Fitzgerald, sir.

No, Mr. Cluff.
Why are you still

Sir, but...
Take Livesey here with you,
go tie up them fishin' boats.
Yes, sir.
You want me to go
with Webber, sir?
Secure fishing boats?
You didn't hear me, Livesey?
Uh, yeah, you with Webber.
Sorry, Richie.
His orders, you know.
(RICHIE SIGHS)
(ALL PRAYING)
That's enough time,
what do you think, huh?
We're takin' on water, we
gotta launch them lifeboats.
Why you gotta be
such a jackass, Brown?
Least we can do, pray for
the captain, Chief Collagen...
Rest of them men.
All good men.
Hey, ain't we good men,
Quirey?
Ah, don't get me wrong.
Prayin's great,
but it ain't everything.
We need to actually
do somethin'.
FRANK: Sybert.
A word.
That hothead Brown, he wants
to launch the lifeboats.
The lifeboats?
Quirey, he wants
to do nothin'.
Now, between them,
the two of them...
are getting the men worked up.
(FRANK GROANS)
Now, I figure that you know
the boat better than anybody.
You're practically
married to it.
So, I think
they'll listen to ya.
Listen to me?
Pop, those men don't like me.
Nobody on the ship likes me
but you and Tchuda.
They might not like you, but
they'll know to listen to ya.
We don't know if the captain
got off an S.O.S.
Radio room's gone.
We can't call nobody!
It's just Garcia over there
with a little shortwave...
tryin' to pick up chatter.
I mean, as far as we know...
nobody even knows
we're out here.
Now I'm saying we launch
them lifeboats now...
and we get off this ship
while we can.
How are you gonna get 'em down
in the water in this storm?
It can't be done,
those boats are too small.
It's suicide, Brown.
BROWN: You can't do this,
you can't do that.
What do you
want us to do, Quirey?
Just sit up here
and do nothin'?
That's it, no officers,
no orders.
Every man for himself.
That ain't the way, Brown.
That never did
nothing for nobody.
Now, the ship's split...
at the bulkheads separating
tanks eight and nine.
Mr. Sybert says that the other
tanks aren't fractured...
So the air in the ballast
tanks should keep us afloat.
But Mr. Sybert
also says that...
Mr. Sybert says this,
Mr. Sybert says that.
He's a big boy.
Let him say it himself.
He's right here.
Go ahead.
Uh...
We're sinking. (CHUCKLES)
(ALL SIGH)
SYBERT: Yeah,
but the whistle works.
So, we should keep
blowing that.
Maybe somebody'll hear it.
I don't know,
but we're definitely sinking.
The crack in the engine room
is takin' on too much water.
Pumps can't keep up.
If the water reaches the
air-intake in the engine...
we're going to,
uh, lose all the power.
And if we lose all the power,
we lose the pumps.
When we lose the pumps...
She's gonna drop pretty quick.
How long have we got
before that happens?
Four, maybe five hours.
(SEAMEN MURMURING)
We need to buy
ourselves some time.
So somebody can find us.
If anybody's even lookin'.
QUIREY: Even if they
do know we're here...
those seas are big enough.
I mean, it ripped
this thing in half.
How the hell
are they gonna get out?
That's why I'm sayin' we gotta
launch some lifeboats.
Our luck's runnin' out.
I don't believe
in luck, Brown.
Put those lifeboats
out in those seas...
they won't last 12 seconds.
You and Quirey both...
you just wanna sit around
and do nothin'.
You got a better idea,
Sybert...
or you just go back,
hide down below?
(SCOFFS)
We're gonna run her aground.
- ALL: Huh?
- (STAMMERS) Do what?
You wanna run her
aground, Sybert?
Even if you could with
half a ship, why would you?
She'd break apart,
dump us all out in that sea.
SYBERT: It's our only choice.
We're gonna find a soft shoal,
and we'll lay her up.
We'll slow the water
that's coming in.
We'll stay in the same spot.
We'll blow the whistle.
We'll give whoever's
coming to look for us...
a chance to find us.
You're gonna steer a ship
without hydraulics?
That's your plan?
How's that gonna work?
I'm gonna build
a manual tiller.
BROWN: Hey, Sybert, why should
we even listen to you?
The only thing you ever cared
about was this ship.
Man, I'll tell you what.
You two make a cute couple
at the bottom of the ocean.
Me, I'm gonna get
on a lifeboat.
Look.
We'll insert a steel beam
into the steering quadrant.
We'll put pulleys
on the end of it for leverage.
And we'll move her manually.

It's just a formality,

Yeah.

They think
it's their best hope.
SYBERT: Oh, Pop.
We need every guy we got.
Well, they're gonna
take them lifeboats.
(SIGHS)
(SEAMEN ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)
(GRUNTS)
What are you
tryin' to do, Sybert?
FRANK: Get off him!
You come up here
tryin' to kill us?
Are you trying to kill us?
TINY: Back off him.
Get up!
You're out of your mind!
QUIREY: Brown, he just
saved your life, okay?
The boat's in pieces.
It's gone!
Enough!
That boat is too small
for these seas.
And this ship
will be sunk by nightfall.
Now, every fella here
wants to live...
and the only way that happens
is if we run her aground!
We gotta set up a watch
and look out for a shoal.
I need four men
working the pulleys...
on the emergency tiller.
I need four men manning
the pumps, aft to steering...
and the rest of you
run a bucket line...
topside down below...
...communicate with
the engine room.
And somebody...
keep blowing that whistle.
You heard him, boys!
Now move it! Come on!
Sounds like
you're the man now, Sybert.
I hope you didn't
just kill us all.
(SIGHS)
CARL: I saw a ship driftin'.
Heard it whistle.
A distress signal.
45 minutes ago, Bernie.
From my house.
Uh...
With the wind blowin' south,
and those currents...
I guess that'd put her
close to here about now...
comin' up over the bar.
Can't be part of
the Mercer, Bernie.
She's off Nantucket,
40 miles southeast of here.
Means she would have
drifted northwest then, right?
I know what I heard.
Know what I saw.
Well, okay, then, uh...
How about we go
back to the station...
see if we can get
to the bottom of it?
Just got off the phone
with Boston.
They diverted a plane
from the Mercer...
and it sighted the stern
of the tanker Pendleton...
five miles east of here.
Oh, my God.
Two tankers broken in half
in one day.
That's gotta be
some kind of record.
Boston and Nantucket
have dispatched...
all their boats to the Mercer.
They can't make it here
in this weather.
(RADAR BEEPING)
Webber.
Pick yourself a crew.
Take that 36500 out
and you go over the bar...
and you find the stern of
the Pendleton. You hear?
Uh... Yes, sir.
Um...
You fellas want to
get warmed up...
get some coffee?
Bernie.
Yeah.
Uh...
What?
What Carl's trying to say...
This isn't about the Landry.
Oh, sure it is.
Richie.
RICHIE: Eight men
died that night.
You and Gus and Masachi
couldn't even get out.
What makes you think
you can do it now?
You know the bar on this
kind of day, right, Bernie?
Yeah.
That man in there
don't know what he's doin'.
He's sending you out to die.
You can't make it over Chatham
bar on a day like this.
Can't stay afloat for long
on half a ship neither.
Mr. Stello, in the Coast Guard
they say, you gotta go out.
But they don't say
you gotta come back in.
That's regulation, you know.
Bernie, better you get lost...
afore you get
too far out, then.
Oh, don't worry about me,
Mr. Ryder.
I can't get lost out there.
I know those waters
pretty good.
How could I get lost?
No, no, no, no, Bernie.
What Dave's trying to say...
you should just
motor around the harbor...
say you tried to get out
and couldn't.
You know?
Thank you, Mr. Ryder.
Thank you.
But, Mr. Stello, I'm gonna do
my best to get out there.
I don't know if I will,
but I'm gonna try.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Okay.
I guess Richie's in.
Who else?
Uh, I don't know, Gus.
You can hardly lift your head.
Who else
you gonna take, Bernie?
Fitz is the only other
engineman left.
And he's only third class...
and he don't got
the experience.
I'll... I'll go.
(STAMMERS) Yeah,
I can do the job.
I mean, I can do it.
You can't go.
You're sick as a dog, Gus.
He's right, Gus.
One more.
(RICHIE CLEARS THROAT)
Someone has to go out there
and save those guys, right?
That's why I signed up.
Guess now's my chance.
Seaman Ervin Maske,

Can you lock
that boiler on full?
You crazy to think
you can steer her broken...
with a couple of ropes
and a hand-made tiller, boy.
You got a better idea?
I'm all ears.
There!
A shoal about a mile distance!
We can make that!
Rudder, 15 degrees to port!

if we want to hit it head on!
Gotta make a turn 80 degrees
on the compass to 310!

- Pull, pull, pull! Come on!
Please tell me
we're takin' that boat...
to a bigger boat.
You ever been
on a rescue mission before?
No.
Mostly I just chip paint.
Sometimes I cook for the boys.
Great.
(GRUNTING)
BERNIE: All right, you,
uh, take the glory hole.
Maske. Ervin Maske.
Ervin, yeah.
Uh, Richie, drop
the mooring line when you can.
Last known position
of the Pendleton is here.
So, I figure
once we cross the bar...
I reckon with the currents...
she'll have drifted
about here.
That's six miles from us.
So, you think Bernie can get
us out past the bar in this?
I've never seen
anything like it.
Yeah, I mean,
he's just gotta be sure...
that he doesn't pitchpole us,
that's all.
Huh?
The power of the waves
on that bar...
they can pick you up...
they can turn you end for end
over and over again.
There's no way
to survive that.
That's pitchpoling.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Hey, Fitz, are we good?
All right, give it a shot!
(ENGINE STARTING)
Free the lines!
Lines freed!
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Did Bernie go out, Gus?
Miriam, what are you
doing here?
Did he?
Yeah, Cluff sent him.
I wanna talk to him.
- Who?
- Cluff.
Your commanding officer.
Where is he?
I wanna find out
where Bernie is.
I'm worried about him.
We're supposed to get married.
Miriam, this isn't what
any of the other girls do.
Or wives.
They don't come in here,
and they don't do this.
So?
If you want,
I guess you can wait in here.
Listen to what's going on.
Sit down.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Tide's risin'.
Gonna work us off that shoal.
We need to hit it hard.
Yeah, there's no other way.
Wave!
(SEAMEN YELPING)
(SEAMEN GROANING)
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
SYBERT: You feel that?
She's drifting.
Must have lost the tiller.
We gotta slow her headway...
or we're gonna miss
that shoal for good.
Close the governor valves,
cut the propulsion.
We gotta isolate the boiler.
We gotta conserve everything
she's got left!
I keep tellin' you, Bouloo.
This boat just bad luck.
It's got nothing...
to do... with luck.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING

Station Chatham,
this is the CG-36500.
Do you copy?
CLUFF: (ON RADIO)
This is Station Chatham.
36500, what is your location?
Over.
BERNIE: Station Chatham,
we, uh...
We are now passing
Morris Island.
Heading down the channel
towards Chatham bar. Over.
What's it mean,
going over that bar?
Miriam,
don't do this to yourself.
Why not?
Why not, Gus?
If I'm gonna be with him,
I wanna know.
You're the girl
with the bear coat, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me. (CHUCKLES)
You gonna tell me
what it's like out there?
Shoals on that bar are never
in the same place twice.
Flood currents carryin' them
big ocean swells...
that rise up
when they hit the shallows...
crash up against that bar.
Outgoing tide
crashes up against that bar.
That, uh...
That man shouldn't have sent
them out to cross that bar...
in a storm like this.
Maybe they can turn back.
Maybe they get lost before.
Can't get out.
You know Bernie, right?
You know he won't
get lost out there.
You know he follows the rules.
(SCOFFS)
Yeah, we know.
We all going down
to the pier soon.
See if there's anything
we can do down there.
Welcome to come.
GUS: Miriam. Miriam!
Miriam, please come here.
Miriam!
Excuse me, are you
Commander Cluff?
Who are you?
I'm Miriam Penttinen,
Bernie Webber's girlfriend.
I want you to call
Bernie back in.
That girl he was
asking me about.
You know what
he was gonna ask me?
For your permission
to marry me.
(SCOFFS)
Well, that's between you,
him and your God.
Asking me is just a formality.
He can marry you all he wants.
Don't he know that?
But you can't be
in here, miss.
It's Bernie.
BERNIE: (ON RADIO)
Chatham bar dead ahead. Over.
36500, Station Chatham.
Proceed as directed
towards Pendleton stern.
I didn't copy that,
Station Chatham.
Conditions hazardous.
Why give us permission if
you're sending him out to die?
What the hell?
Gouthro, get her out of here.
Sir, winds have gone
from 40 to 60...
since the call first come in.
That's gonna be
hurricane strength in an hour.
CLUFF: Gouthro,
he's got his orders.
You get her out of here,
and you get yourself to bed.
You're too sick to be in here.
36500, Station Chatham,
proceed over the bar.
I repeat, proceed.
Once over,
travel directly south.
The radar's intermittent...
but it's showing
a pip 10 or 12 miles...
...east of Monomoy Point,
moving south. Over.
Station Chatham,
this is the 500.
Copy that.
(CLUFF SIGHS)
I hear what everyone's saying.
You don't know
what you're doing.
Excuse me?
Maybe... Maybe it's because
you're not from here.
You don't know
what it's like out there...
What the hell
would you know...
what it's like
out there, miss?
Hmm?
Please, just call them back.
What do you think
it's gonna be like...
being married to
a Coast Guard man?
Please, just call them back.
You gonna come
in here scared...
every time
he out in the water?
Please call them back.
You don't belong here.
Please call them back.
Get out of here!
Get out of my station!
And go home to
where you belong, miss!
Please call them back.
Get out of my station!

If we lose power,
we'll lose our pumps.
And I'm afraid we're taking on
so much water...
the weight will pull us
right back off the shoal.
Feels funny not to be

All right.
Let's get to it.

I need some help.
Yeah, all right.
We live near here.
We can go back to my house.
I'll call my brother.
He can tow you out. Jump in.
Thank you.

You can move that.
We're bringing it

You got a man there?

(TCHUDA LAUGHS)
FRANK: Sybert,
what's going on?
We're using
every pump we've got.
We jammed the breakers so
the pumps wouldn't trip them.
We've got about
two feet till the water...
hits those air inlets
to the engines...
and then the ship's dead.
Jesus Christ.
BROWN: You hear that?
That's the tide rising,
gonna work us off this shoal.
Look, look, this'll at least
give us some time.
Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?
That right. Sure does, boy.
Yeah, long as
we got the generators...
keeping the pumps going.
Buy whoever might be coming...
to find us
a little bit of time.
You wanted to be

Now you're the man, right?
Except you got no wife,
you got no kids back home.
You're a single man.
Always hiding down below.
What you got to lose?
All right,
that's enough, Brown.
I'm scared, too, Brown.
I got a life, the same as you.

with the McCullough.
They said they lost four men,
but saved the rest.
The captain of the Pollock Rip
sent word that they...
GUS: Mr. Cluff!
It's the 36500! It's Bernie!
It's right there on the radio.
BERNIE: Station Chatham?
Station Chatham, copy?
CG-36500,
this is Station Chatham.
Webber, is that you?
Yes, sir, it's me.
It's Bernie.
We got 32 survivors aboard...
from the tanker
Pendleton, sir.
Station Chatham, do you copy?
36500, Station Chatham.
Did you say you have
32 survivors on board?
They rescued them.
They rescued 32 of them!
BERNIE: Yes, sir, 32.
Sir, we've lost our compass,
so we don't know where we are.
But we're gonna try
to make it back home.
Can't get back
without a compass.
MAN 1: Not in this weather.
MAN 2: They're not gonna
make it back.
You lost your compass, Webber.
MALE DISPATCHER:
Negative, 36500,
this is the Pollock lightship.
Do not proceed to shore.
We're five miles northeast...
of the Pendleton's
last known location.
Proceed to our position. Over.
CG-36500, Station Chatham.
Proceed to
the Pollock lightship...
and unload
all survivors. Over.
What do they know, right?
(CHUCKLES) Right, Richie?
CLUFF: CG-36500, do you copy?
If they know where they are...
someone tell me where I am...
because I don't know
where the hell we are.
Webber, do you copy?
I'm not heading out to sea.
No.
This is Station Chatham.
Do you copy?
We just got you
all off a boat...
so there's no way we're gonna
get you all back up one.
CG-36500,
this is Station Chatham.
Webber, your orders
are to proceed...
five miles northeast...
and unload all survivors
onto the Pollock...
(TURNS RADIO OFF)
Sounds like he cut off
his radio, Mr. Cluff.
He's going it on his own.
Bernie Webber.
What do ya know?
WOMAN 1: How are they gonna
find their way home?
MAN 1: He must have
shut off his radio.
WOMAN 2: Those poor boys.
MAN 2: I can't believe
that's happening.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Some more stuff in the car.
WOMAN 3: Power's out now.
MAN 3: How they gonna
see their way home?
MAN 4: Power's out.
The whole town.
The power's out.
MAN 5: Worse than last year.
WOMAN 4:
They'll never make it.
(SIGHS)
- Let's get down to the pier.
- (CHATTER CONTINUES)
How'd you find us
without a compass?
We, uh...
We just jogged along with
the seasonal currents.
- I think we just got lucky.
- (SYBERT CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
Lucky.
So, you know how to get home?
To be honest with ya,
I'm not sure.
Just disobeyed
all my ranking officers...
and they don't know...
so I guess
I'd better then, right?
Had the wind
on my left going out.
Figure if I, uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)
keep her on my right
we ought to be...
heading the right direction.
We just follow
the lights on shore.
Follow all
the lights on shore.
Well, we're in
your hands, Captain.
Listen up!
I'll put the sea behind us.
Just let it push us along
till we lay up somewhere.
The storm's easing up, boys...
so we just look for the lights
on the shore to guide us in.
Even if we have to go so far
as Nobska Point, so be it.
We just gotta find land.
Been one heck of a long day,
right, fellas? (CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
Sure has.
But don't you give up
hope on me now.
She's a good boat.
She'll get us through.
We'll get you home, okay?
We're all going home.
We're with you, Skipper!
(ALL AGREEING)
Yeah! (WHISTLING)
(ENGINE REVVING)
(COUGHING)
(EXHALES)
MAN 1: Keep your lights on!
Like she's doing!
WOMAN 1:
Quick, turn your lights on!
MAN 2: Turn your headlights
on! Everyone!
MAN 3: Turn 'em on!
MAN 4: More lights
so they can see us!
I think we made it
over the bar.
I think high tide
carried us over.
Richie, you see that?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
BERNIE: Fitz!
Turn on the search light!
(TOWNSFOLK MURMURING)
MAN 1: Look, you see that?
MAN 2: Is it them?
MAN 3: Well done, Bernie!
You did it, Webber!
Way to go, Webber!
MALE DISPATCHER: 36500 is now
docking at the Chatham pier.
There appear to be
32 survivors, sir.
Repeat, they have
32 survivors.
(TOWNSFOLK CHEERING)
That's right.
Throw it, son.
MAN 4: Attaboy, Bernie!
(ENGINE POWERING DOWN)
MAN 5: Give 'em a hand.
MAN 6: Good to see you.
Get on up here.
Nice and easy.
MAN 7: We never thought
we'd see you again.
MAN 8: This guy's freezing.
Give me your coat.
MAN 9: Go on in.
It's warm inside.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
Let's get you up to the lodge.
Next up. Come on, now.
I got you.
SYBERT: Good job, Captain.
MAN 11: Way to go, Bernie.
Webber.
Bernie.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Let's go home.
Are we still good
for April 16th?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I asked Cluff for ya.
He said it's just a...
Just a formality.
Now I know, right?
