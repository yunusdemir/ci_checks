PRIME SUSPECT
Episode 4 - Part 1
The Lost Child
No, leave it.
I want to see you.
Sh. Vicki, Vicki. Sh.
What is it?
Is it me?
Can you not bear to look at me?
Chris...
Chris, please.
How am I supposed to uderstand
if you won´t talk to me?
Chris.
Shit.
<i>...thousand and six,</i>
<i>moving slowly east and filling 10:11...</i>
<i>by 13:00 tomorrow.</i>
<i>Low moving steadily east,
expected 150 miles west of Bailey...</i>
<i>1014 by the same time.</i>
- Your change.
- Thanks.
Cheers.
Morning. Jane Tenison.
One, two, three.
Good girl.
Come on.
There. You go find Vicki.
That´s a good girl.
Yes. Where´s she gone?
Huh? Where´s she gone?
Susan.
Vicki.
Come on, lads.
Let´s move on back behind the line.
- Come on, now.
- Can you give us the statement?
- Victoria Jane.
- Everyone calls her Vicki.
And she´s 14 months old?
On the 23rd.
Can you tell me how tall she is her weight.
- Type?
- I´ll have a match by this afternoon.
- How did they get in?
- Screwdriver.
Dave, sort these guys out, please. Now.
My baby.
My baby.
All right.
Well, that´s fine.
Everything´s just as it should be.
If you experience any problems,
don´t hesitate to contact
Dr Gordon or myself.
Terminations performed this early
don´t usually present any...
When can I get back to work?
- Good morning, ma´am.
- Is Superintendent Thorndike in?
He lefl about an hour ago, ma´am.
I´ve put the case files on your desk.
- Will there be anything else?
- No, that´s all, thanks.
Shall I draw the curtains?
What´s the problem with the phones?
- When did Thorndike authorise this?
- Last night. Through the press office.
- The paper approached us with the idea.
- It was a real rush job.
It´s a bloody disaster.
It worked wonders
with the Kelly Parker kidnapping.
Kelly Parker was abducted from a hospital
by a nurse. There was no violence.
It describes Susan Covington´s condition
as serious, for Christ´s sake.
You´re the abductor, you´re scared,
now you might face a murder charge.
If they´re holding the baby,
that could be a death warrant.
- Is Susan conscious yet?
- Yeah, but she´s in shock.
- She´s not responding to anyone.
- She´s got to talk to us.
- What does the psychiatrist say?
- He was dead cagey.
Even minor head wouds can be serious.
The chances are, she could be suffering
from post-traumatic...
- Amnesia, yeah.
- Amnesia.
Afler 24 hours,
memory loss could be permanent.
Forensic foud a blood smear
on the kitchen wall.
- The abductor threw her against it.
- Who´s the chaperone?
- Havers.
- At least you did something right.
- She´ll give us a shout.
- We´ve gotta take the heat off.
So, Richard, arrange to have a camera team
standing by to make an appeal.
If Susan can´t do it, I´ll make it.
Half an hour´s notice.
Right, boss.
No wonder Thorndike was in such a hurry.
I´ll make this short
and to the point as possible.
I´ve got a lot of catching up to do,
and so have the officers from AMIP.
That´s DS Westbrook and DC Aplin.
Now, I know how difficult it is
to give 100º/º on upaid overtime.
But I´m sure we all want to find
Vicki Warwick alive and well.
No-one would want to be
five minutes too late.
Let´s make sure we´re not. OK, Richard.
Warwick is the husband´s name.
He left the family home about 10 months ago.
He´s up north now,
running a farm he inherited.
He says he was at the farm,
at the time of the abduction,
but he lives alone
and no-one can confirm his story.
- Did they search the place?
- Yeah, nothing. And he blew a fuse.
He might have lefl the baby somewhere else.
Girlfriend?
Not that we know of.
The bird he left his wife for
is getting married next week.
The local CID are keeping an eye out.
OK. Tony, Fernham Road?
The back door was forced.
Forensics are a nightmare.
Fingerprints, hair, fibres galore.
Chances are most of them
belong to the builders.
- You tracking them down for examples ?
- Susan has to tell us who they were first.
Until we interview her,
we´ve no way of knowing
what time the intruder
or intruders entered the building,
but we know they didn´t leave
till after 12:30.
The next-door neighbours got back about then
and reversed into Susan´s car.
- Drunk?
- New contact lenses.
- Have you found the car?
- Not yet boss
Well, obviously, that´s a priority.
Now, who´s our abductor?
Well, they´re either local
or at least spend time in the area.
They´d have had to watch the house.
We´ve ruled out kidnapping so far.
We haven´t received a ransom demand
and you only have to look at the house
to know there´s not enough dosh aroud
So we proceed on the assumption that
Vicki was abducted for nurture or abuse.
- Who´s pounding the computers?
- DS McColl guv
I´m compiling a list of paedophiles
living within a 30-mile radius of London.
- What database are you using?
- ENS YS.
There´s another one in Derby that keeps tabs
on suspected as well as convicted.
- I´ll get on it, guv.
- Get hold of the local registrar.
See if anyone´s lost a baby recently,
illness, cot death, miscarriage...
That gets my vote. I don´t see what
a nonce could do with a kid that young.
Try the adoption agencies,
see if anyone´s been refused an application.
Maybe they wouldn´t take no for an answer.
- I´ll do that, guv.
- Good. Thanks.
Well, right, I think that´s it.
- Come on, then.
- No. Wait a minute.
This is a long shot, but it might be
worthwhile. Call traffic.
See if their cameras caught the missing car
on monday night.
If I´d just abducted a baby and
bust the mother on the head,
I might be rattled enough
to run a red light or break the speed limit.
All right. That´s it.
Let´s find Vicki Warwick.
Theresa, I´ve got to go now.
A detective
Yeah
Yeah, she showed me her card, her ID.
Yeah, OK. OK.
Sorry. It´s Natalie´s mum.
She´s a bit anxious.
- How long have you worked for Susan?
- Since Vicki was born.
- Not easy working for two families.
Oh!  It´s no problem  as long
if the kids don´t hate each other.
Susan and Theresa work for the same firm
so it costs them less than two nannies
and I make a bit extra.
So you got to Susan´s house at 7:30.
Was that normal time?
Yeah. I picked Natalie up at seven
and went right over.
We do one week here and the next at Susan´s,
you know alternate
- Is she gonna be all right?
- She´s conscious but she´s still in shock.
You used a mobile phone to call us?
Susan gave it to me to carry
in case of emergencies.
I moaned about it
cos I already had enough to lug around.
- Where did you get this?
- Susan brought it back from Florida.
Did you know you could be prosecuted
for just carrying Mace?
No.
She got me that about a month ago
I was supposed to take a photo
if anyone dodgy was hanging around
when I took the kids to the park.
The film´s blank,
except for the shots I took to try it out.
- What of?
- Vicki.
I´ll borrow this.
I´ll return it tomorrow with the negatives.
- They´re recent photos you see
- Go ahead.
Thank you for your help.
Woman who reported it
was out walking her dogs.
- Any of the kids in custody?
- One. Malcolm Roberts.
Ten years old. Spends more time in
the local nick than he does at school.
Anyway, his gang found it about eleven
this morning, keys still in the ignition.
- But he doesn´t drive...
- No sign of Vicki?
- No, sorry, guv.
- We´re only five minutes from Susan´s.
Why ditch it here?
Maybe they had another car waiting.
Muddyman.
Kids like Malcolm have their eyes peeled.
Talk to him again.
See if he saw another car
parked around here.
Guv.
She´d had a rotten day
A rotten week, really.
She couldn´t eat and she wouldn´t settle.
I had to take her to the doctor
when her first teeth came through.
I finally put...
I finally got her to sleep
at about half past one.
Then I went downstairs.
Not to bed?
I had work to do.
I´m... craming for my exams.
I´m taking my taxation finals on Tuesday.
Today.
I started to read, then I fell asleep.
- And how long were you asleep?
- Not long
Something woke me
I went into the hall...
When I got near the kitchen,
I was grabbed -
pulled from behind.
I tried to fight, I tried.
Then I was thrown against the wall.
- I don´t remember falling or...
- Can you describe your attacker?
Susan, anything.
The smallest detaiI´s absolutely crucial.
Did you get an impressión of their build
or feel what clothes they were wearing?
- I´m sorry.
- It´s all right. It´s all right.
If you remember anything later on,
just tell Maureen.
Susan I spoke to Carolyn today your nanny
And she told me you´d given her a camera
to carry around. Do you remember that?
- It was about a month ago.
- Yes.
- Why did you do that?
- I don´t know.
Well, has someone been following
you and Vicki?
Have you noticed someone
watching the house?
- Well, have you...
- There was someone.
In the park. In Fernham Park.
He had two little girls with him.
- He didn´t look dangerous, but...
- But what?
- He was clingy.
- What do you mean, ´´clingy´´?
Difficult to get rid of. He kept...
putting his hands on Vicki´s pushchair
and touching her.
Can you describe him for me?
Right. Hey, where´s Mumy?
Where´s Mumy?
Hello, Mumy! Hello!
"I don´t want anything to happen to you
or Vicki. Revenge is the last thing..."
- How´s she doing?
- She´s not too happy about the make-up.
It´s important she looks healthy.
Did you explain that?
Yeah, but it´s bound to feel odd,
like tarting yourself up for a rapist.
No joy at the factory, boss.
We got clear impressions of
the Renault tyres but nothing else.
Shit. All right, well, just put anyone
you can on a house-to-house search.
Maybe they were stupid enough
to dump the car on their own doorstep
Did you get the photos back from the lab?
I´ve been polite, sarcastic and obnoxious.
They´ve got a backlog.
Would have been better off
sending them to Boots.
You up to this?
Good.
I hope I´m talking to the person
who has Vicki.
I´d give anything to hold
my little girl again.
I´m very frightened.
Perhaps you´re frightened too.
I don´t want anything to happen
to you or to Vicki.
Revenge is the last thing I want.
I don´t want you to be puished
You just need help
Please help us all you me and Vicki
by contacting the police
The sooneryou call
the sooner we can all stop being afraid
Please bring Vicki back
Please bring
Bring
I don´t know.
How reliable do you think this thing is?
Run it by the nanny,
see if it rings any bells.
From traffic, guv.
Boss. Traffic came through.
Bugger my boots.
- What´s this code?
- The camera location.
Falloden Way.
It´s a stretch of the A1 here,
just below the M1.
Nowhere near where it was abandoned.
3:30, two hours afler Susan was attacked.
They couldn´t have spent
that long in the house.
- Where the hell were they going?
- To dump the corpse.
- Or transfer the body somewhere else.
- Shall I call off the house-to-house?
No, perhaps they made the drop
and didn´t fancy a long walk home.
We could get the shot enhanced
for a silhouette.
We´ll die of old age before we get that
back, but try first thing tomorrow.
So...
Vicki Warwick could be anywhere
north of London.
No. It started to get light around 5:30.
They wouldn´t want to be seen
ditching the car.
They were caught speeding at 3:30.
Two hours to get where they were going
and come back.
Less five or ten minutes to drop the baby.
If we work out the farthest they could go
and get back in 80 minutes,
we´ve got our search radius.
But if the second vehicle theory holds good,
he could be in Scotland by now.
I thought you were supposed to be
working the nonce records, hm?
Go on, then.
Prick.
Where are you?
- Kernan.
- Mike, it´s Jane.
Hello Jane I saw the appeal
You handled it very well
I need more help. The Service Level
Agreement guarantees me more officers.
You´ve got all the bodies
you´re entitled to under SLA.
If it turns into a murder investigation,
I can get you another six men.
Are they supposed to be pallbearers?
You know as well as I do,
this kid is probably dead already.
No! No, I do not know that!
I need more detectives, Mike,
I need more uniforms.
- Vicki needs them.
- I´m sorry.
Jesus, Mike. You can´t spare six officers
to help save a child´s life...
but you can spare them to find her killer.
Go home, get some sleep.
Give me an update in the morning.
You OK, guv?
Yeah.
Where did you say that husband lived?
Derbyshire.
- M1?
- Yeah. They searched the place once.
We´ll drive up tomorrow and do it ourselves.
Local plod are gonna love us. Night.
Night.
Hello?
Hello? Do you want to leave
a message for Susan?
Mr Warwick?
Mr Warwick? Hello?
Mr Warwick?
Mr Warwick sir?
There´s no-one upstairs, ma´am.
Perhaps he´s out with his stock.
- Or perhaps he´s done a runner.
- We´ve got two men watching the house.
Well, the house isn´t gonna run, is it?
Mr Warwick?
Mr Warwick?
This is Detective Constable Hawker.
Mr Warwick?
Mr Warwick?
Mr Warwick!
- Mr Warwick!
- I´m Detective Superintendent Tennison.
What are you doing here?
I want to ask you some questions
about your daughter.
D´you recognise him?
He might have had
two little girls with him -
one dark, one fair -
about six or seven years old.
- No.
- You´re positive?
Who is he?
He was seen approaching your wife
in Fernham Park last month.
I haven´t been in London for a year,
let alone Fernham Park.
- Why do you live up here?
- My father died about 11 months ago
Somebody has to look afler the place.
- And you live here alone?
- You know I do.
But you lefl your family
because of an affair.
Yeah, two of them: Me and Margaret Lacey,
Susan and her career.
You don´t approve of women
who take their careers seriously?
Not if it makes them selfish.
I don´t approve of anyone
who turns a career into a fetish.
I was an estate agent. I made a pile at it.
- But it wasn´t an obsessión
- Just as well, since you got fired.
- The bottom fell out of the market.
- And you lived on your wife´s income.
Yes, but there isn´t a mortgage.
She used the money from her father´s will,
and I did the deal, a bloody good one.
And my money paid for the restorations
I´m gonna fight her for custody.
Vicki´d have a better life here.
I mean, where would you rather grow up?
I could look afler her just as well.
Better. She wouldn´t have been kidnapped
if I´d been with her.
Yeah, but you weren´t, were you?
Do you think you´ll be awarded
custody of Vicki?
Your chances are rather slim.
You´re an unfaithful husband,
you lefl the family home,
you haven´t seen your daughter in...
- That´s only because of Susan.
- She wouldn´t let you?
No, but when you fall in love you think,
"This is what it´s like? I never knew."
The same thing goes for falling in hate.
I couldn´t stand to be near her.
- You hate your wife?
- Deeply.
- Enough to take Vicki?
- No.
- Did you pay someone else to take her?
- No!
- Well, where is she?
- I don´t know! I wish to Christ I did!
- Didn´t your man turn up?
- This is ridiculous.
I was here all weekend.
I told you, I couldn´t possibly...
- Where did you... How dare you...
- Do you want to read the search warrant?
This is a credit card receipt for petrol
you bought at the services on the M1
2:30 on Sunday aflernoon.
You were not here all weekend
You were in London Why did you lie?
Were you planning on abducting Vicki?
If you don´t talk to us,
I´m taking you down to London.
- Cuff him I´m arresting you on
- I was with Margaret.
I´m sorry?
Margaret Lacey.
Mrs Margaret Harper as of next Friday.
She lives in Hendon.
We were together when...
When Vicki was taken.
Oh.
Oh, I see. You were sleeping
with someone else´s fiancée
when your daughter was abducted.
Is that what you´re trying to tell me?
She´s dead, isn´t she?
Bloody hell. Sorry, mate.
Yeah, I´ll call you back. Yeah.
Get on the phone and have them blow this up.
Quick.
They may be slow, but they´re not stupid.
Get copies run off for the boys out there
and then blitz the neighbourhood.
Eliminate from our enquiries.
I don´t want his relatives or
mates panicking him.
- Right.
- All right, go on.
Now, the chances are he visits this park
on a regular basis.
The kids are eating ice creams.
Check out vans that work the area.
Someone must know who he is.
Christopher Edward Hughes.
Born 4th September 1956.
December ´85 sentenced
to 14 years imprisonment
afler the systematic abuse
of his seven-year-old stepdaughter.
June ´92 six months residential Osborne
Clinic, released on parole December ´92.
Touchstone Avenue. Only half a bloody mile
from Vicki Warwick´s house
and a 20-minute walk from the factory
where the Renault was dumped.
Gotcha.
Jane, Jane...
Listen, nobody goes in without a warrant.
Have you got a warrant?
Good. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Thanks for your cooperation, Mr Warwick.
We´ll verify his alibi.
If he needs to see his stock,
cuff him to a cow.
Come on.
Come on.
Sod it.
- Hey
- Jesus Christ.
Look at this.
Bye-bye, Annabelle.
- Christopher Edward Hughes?
- Yeah. Who are you?
DI Muddyman,
Southampton Row Police Station.
- Cuff him.
- What´s going on?
I´m arresting you on suspición
of the abduction of Vicki Warwick.
That´s bollocks.
- Do you understand?
- I don´t know anything about the baby.
- Do you understand?!
- Yes!
- They´re just pictures from magazines.
- Pictures of young children.
There´s no law against
collecting pictures of children.
Not ones like that, anyway.
And I haven´t had any
of the other sort in years.
There´s no harm in them.
Plenty of harm in this, though, Christopher.
All these children missing,
abused, murdered.
Why´d you take such an interest in them?
Look, I was sick, I was screwed up,
all right?
I went to a clinic
when I come out of prison.
That´s what they taught me.
When you´re sick, like say you´ve got cancer,
and then they cure you,
you´d still be interested in the disease,
different cases, causes,
new cures.
No cures in here, Christopher,
just the disease.
You´ve worked at CarFit for six months.
Yeah, bloke I went to school with owns it.
He believes in giving people
a second chance.
But the money´s not up to much,
though, is it?
Sometimes I have to skip a few meals.
What´s that got to do with anything?
Skip a few meals?
2,000 quid here, Christopher.
Yeah, I play the horses.
An accumulator paid off.
Came to nearly three grand.
I spent about 900 buying a telly for Anne
and some presents for the girls.
A mattress is a strange place
for this amount.
Why not put it in a savings account?
Sooner or later, some nosy bastard
wants to know where it come from.
You used to be a member
of the paedophile information exchange.
Not any more.
Supposing you were still in touch
with your old mates,
what would the going rate be
for a 14-month-old child? 2,000 quid?
- Where is she?
- Don´t know.
- Why did you take the car?
- What car?
Susan Covington´s.
Did your client need a lifl home?
I didn´t take her.
I told you, I was with me girlfriend.
Why don´t you just ask her?!
Do you recognise this woman?
No, I´ve never seen her before.
Now do you recognise her?
I´ve never met her.
Take as much time as you need.
- Number four.
- Yes!
He´s the man from the park.
How did you find him so quickly?
- Has he taken a child before?
- I´m afraid we can´t tell you that.
We watched a film on the box
then turned in We were together all night
He couldn´t have left
when you were asleep?
- No I´m a light sleeper
- What time did he leave the house?
- Well, at about 1:30, but...
- I´m sorry
I thought you said you´d spent
the night together.
- We had a fight.
- What about?
Nothing, really.
Afler a couple of minutes, I went afler him
and we spent the night at his place.
- So you lefl the children unattended?
- No. What is it with you people?
You see a single mother and think we´re all
screwed up, useless, disaster areas.
- I´m sorry.
- It´s half term.
Gayle and Alison were sleeping over
at a friend´s house
afler Chris had taken us
all to the pictures.
Where did you catch up with Chris?
Fernham Park. It´s on his way home.
He was sitting there about to come back,
but his place is closer.
- What time did you leave him?
- Seven.
- How long was he out of your sight?
- 15 minutes.
And you´re prepared to sign a statement
to that effect?
Look, what´s Chris supposed to have done?
We´re questioning him in connection
with the abduction of Vicki Warwick.
What, that baby that was taken?
You´re crazy.
How long have you known him?
Since last August, about six months.
He´s a decent bloke.
God knows, there aren´t many of them about.
How did you meet him?
I don´t see that that´s any
of your business.
- An ad.
- What kind of ad?
In the local paper.
Attractive 30-something divorcee
seeks sincere, caring man
for friendship and possible romance.
Good sense of humour essential.
Must love children.
See if her neighbours
saw or heard her leave the house.
Also, re-interview everyone in Hughes´s building.
- See if anyone saw her arrive or leave.
- Right.
We´ve got him till 12 o´clock tomorrow.
That´s... 19 hours to get something solid
or we´re gonna have to let him walk.
Richard, how did he hold up?
Had to ease off when his brief turned up.
What did he say
when you told him he´d been identified?
He couldn´t remember.
He talks to a lot of people in the park.
- He´s a friendly bloke.
- Especially with kids
We´ve gotta break his alibi
and we´ve got to find out
who might´ve bought Vicki.
So keep the boys at it,
all known associates.
Also check with
Anne Sutherland´s relatives and friends
See if anyone´s suddenly got
an extra little girl.
Let´s wheel him up again, boss.
Let me take a crack at him.
No, you´re driving me to Bedford.
- Bedford?
- Yeah. The Osborne Clinic.
There´s a car coming!
Superintendent!
Bog off. Bog off.
They really piss me off.
Sorry. They had to be opened.
Makes you think, though.
Some people´s hearts are in the right place.
Fancy some tea?
Dr Schofield´ll be with you shortly
I saw the broadcast you made.
Was a psychiatrist consulted?
- There wasn´t time.
- I´m assuming you wrote the appeal.
- Mm-hm.
- Did a very good job.
- For an amateur?
- No, no, by any standards.
Please, sit.
So, how much evidence
do you have against Hughes?
He´s our prime suspect.
And you haven´t found the child as yet?
No. We think that Hughes
may have been paid to take her.
What, by another paedophile?
Yes, perhaps by someone he served time with.
- Or met here
- I would say that was very unlikely.
Hughes didn´t form friendships
here or in prison.
How can you know that?
I am correct in assuming you´re here
to benefit from my professional opinion?
Please, sit down.
Most of our clients take to the theory
and practice of group therapy
with an ease that sometimes
borders on enthusiasm.
But our Mr Hughes was disruptive.
That´s why he was referred to me.
You´re an independent consultant?
I have a practice and some of
my spare time is spent on research.
I´m doing some work for the Met.
Given the seriousness of our case,
would you build a profile of our abductor?
No.
But only because it´s so serious.
What I can tell you is
that I would very much doubt
whether Hughes is the person
that you´re looking for.
Why?
Because he would never abuse a child
younger than five years old.
He´d consider it perverse.
He believes that children
reach sexual maturity at five.
That´s the age he was
when he was first abused.
- That´s no bloody excuse, is it?
- No. But it is the reason.
You have to understand that 98º/º
of our clients are the products of abuse.
Not everyone who´s abused
turns into a nonce.
That´s the most important aspect
of the work that we do here
Learning how to treat abused children
so they don´t turn into monsters.
But you only get half the story.
That´s true, but unfortunately we have
serious problems in gaining insights
into mature survivors of abuse.
- Hughes told us that you´d cured him.
- Really?
The client could spend the rest of his life
in here and still not be healed.
The wounds are too old.
And I´m afraid that there are no cures.
- Castration.
- No cures that the law allows.
Why did you release him?
It´s not my decisión.
It´s up to the parole board and
the local authority paying for his treatment.
The best that we can do for these men
is to get them to acknowledge
their behaviour is deviant,
examine the reasons and help them to
achieve some measure of control over it.
Hughes is dating a divorcee,
the mother of two little girls six and seven
How much control did you give him?
Can we see Hughes´s case notes?
No.
Dr Schofield, a child´s life
is at stake here.
It´s a question of ethics and,
beside which, I would very much doubt
whether you´re qualified
to interpret the material correctly.
And you´re certain that he didn´t take her?
Well, Dr Schofield, I dare say
that you won´t care too much
about professional ethics
if Vicki Warwick is found dead.
You could have saved her.
Thank you.
Susan
Superintendent Tennison´s here
Can she come in for a few minutes?
Hello, Susan.
I´m sorry. There´s no news about Vicki yet.
- Is Maureen looking afler you?
- She´s spoiling me.
I´m so used to living on my own.
I wanted to ask you a question about the man
you identified, Christopher Hughes.
He´s got an alibi.
So did you ever see him with another man?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I only saw him once.
With the little girls
I´m sorry.
It´s all right. Thank you.
Will he be released?
I don´t know.
I want her back.
Please bring her back.
Travellers made camp yesterday.
One of the kids spotted a bag
stuck in the sluice.
Could have been dropped miles upstream.
The current´s a killer.
Without drainage to the lake,
it might never have been found.
- Where are the nearest houses?
- That way about half a mile.
My boys are asking
but I doubt if anybody´s seen anything
Where did the travellers phone in from?
Payphone on the motorway services
We got here as soon as we had the call
Is this your girl?
Yes.
- How long´s she been in the water?
- Two or three days. No rigor present.
If the water weren´t so cold,
she´d have started to decay.
Was she molested?
Hard to say yet. We´ll need
rectal and vaginal swabs, but she is naked.
What did she die of?
Until I see her lungs, I can´t say for sure.
No, no cutting.
Not until she´s been formally identified.
And I want Oscar Bream to do the postmortem.
Thank you.
Is this Vicki?
Did she suffer?
No.
We´ll get whoever did this, I promise you.
I promise you
There he is!
Tony, forget it.
The 24 hours were up.
I want surveillance on Hughes
and I want him to know it.
If Anne´s daughters are at risk,
I want him to think twice.
Go back to the names
from our offenders´ search
and the disappointed adopters
and bereaved parents.
I want them all interviewed,
relatives, friends, neighbours, the lot!
- Wild-goose chase.
- It is not a wild-goose chase!
If you need an incentive
go down to Oscar Bream´s
and see what´s lying on his slab!
Have you got anything from forensics,
Richard?
They´re still working.
But it looks like the river´s probably
washed away any of the evidence.
But he did say that
the mud from the river bank...
matches the mud found
in the Renault´s... where the...
- Foot well!
- Foot well.
Yeah, well, all right.
That´s not much, but it´s something.
All right, that´s it.
Except, uh...
I know what hours you´ve been putting in.
No-one could be working any harder.
Thank you.
Put the new boys to work, Tony.
Right, guv.
Boss, there´s a Dr Schofield
waiting in reception.
I heard about the little girl.
I´m very sorry.
We all are.
Look, I need to know, Vicki Warwick,
were there any signs of abuse?
We haven´t got the medical reports yet.
Are you still certain we´ve got
the wrong man?
Can I see him?
Is that why you´re here?
Your finger is on a trigger.
This kind of emotional stress
could drive him back
to established behaviour patterns.
As far as we know,
he hasn´t abused the girls available to him,
but if you keep this pressure up,
then there´s every chance
that he´ll fixate on them.
Can I see the file?
What´s all the cloak and dagger about?
You and me, video room, no guests.
<i>Vanessa was five when I married Carol.</i>
<i>Five and three quarters.</i>
<i>I mean even a couple of months
is a big deal at that age.</i>
<i>She was wondenful.</i>
<i>And like, um, you know
when she started to trust me.</i>
<i>You.</i>
<i>There´s no trust like a child´s.</i>
<i>It´s like... it´s like perfect.</i>
<i>It´s a perfect thing, yeah?</i>
<i>She´d look up at me with
them big green eyes.</i>
<i>People can´t meet your eyes
like that.</i>
<i>She didn´t uderstand what she felt.</i>
<i>And you helped her to uderstand?</i>
<i>Yeah gently.</i>
<i>It was like a game.</i>
<i>The best game.</i>
<i>You know she´d get so excited.</i>
<i>She´d fill with such emotion
and there´d be tears.</i>
<i>She loved me that much...</i>
<i>It doesn´t occur to you
she may have been frightened?</i>
<i>No she loved me.</i>
<i>Men like you can sometimes
frighten children-</i>
<i>No, no only the bastards. Yeah.</i>
<i>The ones who are too pig ignorant to know
how to help a child to uderstand.</i>
<i>And...</i>
<i>There was this one bloke a bloke here
one of those group sessions...</i>
<i>and he bought his little girl
two kittens, right?</i>
<i>- Yeah
- And...</i>
<i>After she got attached...</i>
<i>he killed one.</i>
<i>He strangled it in front of her...</i>
<i>and said he´d do the same to the other one
if she didn´t do what he wanted...</i>
<i>Bastard.</i>
<i>I mean, imagine putting me
someone like me...</i>
<i>in the same room
as a shit like that...</i>
<i>Jesus!</i>
Hughes was sent to prison in 1985
It was probably only then
that he realised there was no chance...
of seeing Vanessa again.
He was foud with his wrists slashed...
and he was in a critical condition
for some time...
I really think I should see him.
We had to release him an hour ago.
Where are the girls?
They´re playing roud at Angela´s.
I took ´em over before I came to meet you.
- You didn´t tell ´em I´d been arrested?
- What do you think?
Thanks for sticking up for me,
making the statement and that.
Some people get scared, you know.
Just being around the police
makes them feel guilty.
They must have guilty consciences,
then, mustn´t they?
You want to know why they picked me up?
They´re picking up anyone local
who´s got a record.
You didn´t tell me you had one.
No.
Sorry. It was years ago.
Some burglaries. I got 14 months
in Wandsworth. I should have told you.
What would burglary
have to do with a kidnapping?
The place was broken into.
Expert job, they reckoned.
Thought I might have done it.
- Mind those filthy overalls.
- They didn´t give me time to change.
- I could always take ´em off.
- No.
You need to eat before you go back to work
and I´ve got to pick up the girls.
Sharon, get me DCI Turner
of the Child Protection Team.
Yeah, that´s Ruth Turner. Soon as possible.
Yes. Ruth?
Well, keep trying. Thanks.
- Danny, have you got Hughes´s file?
- Tony´s using it.
Jane Right well
There was no physical trauma consistent
with attempted or actual intromissión.
There was nothing on the internal swabs.
She didn´t drown. There was hardly any water
in the lungs, none in her tumy.
- What was the cause of death?
- Asphyxiation
The lungs stop working
but the blood becomes depleted of oxygen.
This can cause a colour change
in the victim´s skin, cyanosis.
Though she´s been in the water,
you can see a blue tinge
on the tips of the ears,
lips and the nail beds,
and there´s cyanotic congestion in all
the major organs, especially the lungs.
- And was she strangled?
- No, that would have lefl bruising.
Provided we get negative results
from the toxicology and drug screens,
my guess is she was suffocated.
It can take as little as 20 to 30 seconds.
She died quickly.
They can always tell
when they´ve got a rival...
especially if it´s their daughter.
No Carol was a pain in the neck.
It was touch and go whether I could
put up with her till I met little Vanessa.
- Did you make love with Carol?
- Yeah but not often.
Anyway I don´t think she minded that much.
I mean she had a rough time
with her first husband
I think all she really wanted
was to be treated decent
Anyway you put up with anything don´t you?
To be near someone that you love.
- Where is she?
- Seven. He lefl her place at 1:30.
She didn´t see him again
until the next morning.
Pick him up.
- What time did he leave your house?
- Half past one, like I said.
I was telling the truth about the fight.
Well, who started it?
Um, I don´t know. Um...
I suppose he did. It was over, um...
Well, he won´t make love
unless the light is off,
and I wanted to leave it on
and we ended up shouting.
In your statement,
you said you went afler him.
I was too upset,
but the next morning I felt silly,
so I went round to his bedsit and
he said he was sorry, I said I was sorry,
one thing led to another and...
Aflerwards, he told me
that he´d got drunk...
because he thought he was gonna lose me
and he´d got into a fight...
and he thought
that there might be some trouble.
So he asked me to say that we were together
if anyone asked about him.
Now, why have you changed your mind, Anne?
There was something about him today.
Afler he was released.
There was something different.
And I was scared.
And, um, then I...
saw that little girl on the telly and...
Get out of the bloody way!
Get off!
No!
Jesus.
Get an ambulance. Jesus Christ, Tony!
Well, I was off balance.
It was his own fault!
- Do you want someone to stay with you?
- No. We´ll be fine.
- Guv.
- Drive Miss Sutherland home.
- Arrange for someone to pick up...
- Guv.
Would you just wait here for a moment?
- What?
- Cock-up.
Hughes is on his way to hospital.
No, he´s walking wounded.
Aplin.
OK, guv.
She wants us back at the station.
What will you tell her?
Like you said, you were off balance.
Shit.
Have we hit someone?
- You all right?
- OK, you two.
Home, James.
- Where the hell is he?
- We don´t know.
Find him. Send him back.
Stake out the bedsit.
Get a car sent round to Fernham Road.
And tell Maureen Havers Hughes is running.
- Hughes is on his way to hospital.
- Aplin´s on his way to hospital.
- Christ knows where Hughes is.
- He could hardly walk.
And I want to hear about that. Richard,
get over to Anne Sutherland´s place.
Now! Fast!
Ali! Gayle! Come on!
Come on I´ve got your bubbles
- Hello?
- Come on you two!
You can watch televisión later!
Hold on a minute.
The roof has fallen down
I´ll have to dig a tunel
What´s making it collapse?
- Too much weight on
- Mm.
Ali, you nearly gave me a heart attack.
Police are on the phone.
Hello.
Gayle, come here, love.
What´d you tell ´em?
Gayle, come on, darling.
- What´d you tell ´em?!
- Gayle! Run!
Run! Get out! Get out!
Shit!
He almost dragged me into the bloody road.
- It´s bollocks!
- Haskons´ll back me up.
- You´d better hope the van driver does.
- It all happened too fast.
- Is that what you´ll say in court?
- Look!
Hughes was dead set on doing a runner
from the moment he saw us.
Not because he was scared shitless
he´d get done over, by any chance?
Yes!
Hughes is at Anne Sutherland´s place.
Richard got there 30 seconds too late.
He got cut.
- Is she in the house?
- She´s a hostage.
What about the kids?
Mum?
She´s fine. You can see her in a minute.
Just try and pretend it´s a game.
Just try and pretend it´s...
Can we clear the area?
Let´s go.
Is it the one with the punched-out window
in the front door?
Danny into the corner.
Mind the cabling.
Guv.
On yourpositions.
Andrews.
Right.
Land line´s hooked up, guv.
DI Muddyman to the incident room.
Are the children safe?
Chris, are you listening?
Are Alison and Gayle safe?
How can you ask that
when we´re surrounded by snipers?
They´re here to protect Anne
and the children.
And I´m here to make sure no-one gets hurt,
and that includes you.
Chris?
I just wanted to talk to Anne.
I had to come and find her, that´s all.
- I just need to talk
- Chris?
Chris are you listening? Chris?
I´ve been paging you for the past hour.
I´m sorry. I didn´t hear.
Oh, no, no.
That´s not good enough, Inspector.
Well, I´m sorry, ma´am!
All right?!
How did you change Anne Sutherland´s mind?
She was guilty about covering for him.
I just convinced her it was serious.
- I touched a nerve.
- And how did you do that?
I just showed her Vicki Warwick´s photograph
and asked her how she´d feel
if one of her own children had been hurt.
- Where are the therapy tapes?
- I don´t know anything about them.
I spoke to Schofield.
Did you steal the case file too?
I didn´t do that, no.
You´re finished.
I mean, do you realise what you´ve done?
- She won´t say anything.
- We´ll never get a conviction!
- We´ll get a conviction. Come on!
- Do you have any idea what you´ve done?
I had it all sorted. I had it sorted.
That prick should have cuffed him.
He´s got the children!
He won´t hurt them.
I did it to protect them. Hughes...
For Christ´s sake,
you heard what Schofield said.
He´s got a knife at her throat,
he´s got the children
and you´re the one that put them there!
Oh, God. It happened to you, too, didn´t it?
Tony how old were you?
I´m disgusting.
I´m disgusting
I love you
Just tell me what happened.
Anne, please.
- Talk to me.
- I want to see Alison and Gayle.
- I love you.
- I know what you are.
I know, so don´t lie.
That I was in a clinic yeah?
How they helped me.
I´m not like I was before.
You know, I...
I was only like that cos, like,
what happened to me when I was a kid, yeah?
Because of what was done to me.
All me feelings and thoughts
are all twisted,
you know, all sort of shaken up, yeah?
But I understand now.
I´ve never hurt Ali and Gayle.
They´re too special to us.
And you´re the only woman that...
that I´ve ever felt anything for.
- Give us a chance!
- You´re a liar!
Who was here, then, eh?
Eh?
That big bastard, was it?
What´d you say to him?
Mummy?
Mum
Please, Chris. Please.
- Hello? Chris?
- I want to talk to Tennison.
We might be able to arrange that, but...
I´ll only talk to Tennison now, no-one else.
- Chris...
- Get her out front. I want to see her.
Chris, I have to speak to Anne first.
Oh, shit.
<i>The siege at Helliers Road in Islington
began soon after five o´clock.</i>
<i>The identity of the man holding
the family hostage is still uconfirmed...</i>
<i>but reports suggest
that the intruder may be a man...</i>
<i>who escaped from police custody
earlier today...</i>
The man had been detained in connection
with the murder of Vicki Warwick.
Are you all right?
I think I´ll just go upstairs
and lie down for a while.
Is the man in the house
the same man who escaped this aflernoon?
- DCI Birnam. They briefed you?
- Is he on the line?
This phone.
Hello. Chris, can you hear me?
Did you get that bastard
to work me over, eh?
Inspector Muddyman
has been removed from the case
and his conduct will be
the subject of an official inquiry.
Now, nobody´s out to get you, Chris.
Did you talk to Schofield?
- Yes.
- What´d he tell you?
That you are unlikely to have taken Vicki.
Then why is all this happening?!
Chris. Chris, listen.
Why won´t anyone believe me?!
Chris, I´m only interested in the truth.
OK? You have to convince me
that I can trust you
Chris?
Chris?
- Superintendent.
- Anne?
- Anne, are you all right?
- I lied. I´m sorry.
What do you mean?
What did you lie about?
In my statement today.
Chris was with me that night.
I was just afraid he´d hurt my kids.
I wanted him locked away
where he couldn´t hurt anybody.
- This is all my fault.
- Did you hear that?
Yes.
D´you believe it?
Yes, I think I do.
But we can´t talk properly until
you release Anne and the children.
- I can´t.
- Yes, you can.
And you´ll get rid of the snipers?
Tell him yes.
Yes, they´ll be withdrawn.
- I don´t believe you.
- I give you my word.
- I need a doctor!
- We can´t send in a doctor.
But if you come out
with Anne and the children,
we´ll get you to hospital imediately.
Those bastards out there´ll
do anything to get me.
They won´t, I promise you.
Now, do you hear me? I promise.
This is Stubbs. The hostages will be
leaving the house first...
and crossing the street
to the intelligence cell.
If the hostage taker does anything
likely to endanger them,
you´re authorised to fire
at your own discretion.
I repeat you are authorised to fire
at your own discretion
Susan!
Susan?
Shit!
Miss Covington.
- I have to speak to him.
- I´m afraid you can´t go in there.
- What are you doing here?
- He mustn´t hurt those children.
This way Susan Susan
It´s all right Chris.
You can trust me, I promise.
- Chris...
- You bastard!
Gayle!
Gayle! No!
I want my Gayle!
No!
Chris?
Chris can you hear me?
- I´m sorry.
- Chris?
- Chris can you hear me?
- I´m sorry.
Chris?
I gave him my word
those snipers would be withdrawn.
You lied to me.
It´s standard procedure
for negotiators to be...
- Anne Sutherland was almost killed.
- No.
My man pulled that shot
as soon as she ran into his line of fire.
Hughes was scared of catching a bullet.
First thing he sees is one of your men.
We won´t know that
till afler the tactical debriefing, will we?
Oh, Jesus.
Where are you going?
To the intelligence cell.
He´s still got a little girl.
No.
- What do you mean, no?
- No.
You´re contaminated.
Hughes won´t trust you now.
Yeah, well, whose fault is that?
DCI Birnam will handle the negotiations
from now on.
Negotiations.
Boss.
I didn´t want him to hurt anyone.
I heard the shot.
- No-one was hit.
- The children
He´s got the youngest.
- Why did he do it?
- What, take the hostages?
- To prove his innocence
- Is he?
Of taking Vicki?
Yes.
Yes, I think so.
What do you think?
It´s my fault, isn´t it?
If I hadn´t remembered
seeing him in the park.
No. He made choices.
He did this to himself.
But he must have been frightened.
If he panicked.
It´s so easy to make a mistake,
lose control.
You must have been frightened
when they fired.
No.
More that sick feeling you get
when something´s gone terribly wrong.
I´m frightened for Gayle
Is that her name?
Have you ever hurt anyone?
Once.
I had a gun. I shot back.
None of us know how we will cope
in a crisis.
You see, I don´t think
I could have done what you did.
You had a child you´re all alone
I wouldn´t have done it if I´d realised.
The idea, the... image
that´s shoved down your throat.
It´s a lie
You struggle to get a good job
and then you struggle to keep it.
You get a house and...
fill it with all the things
you´re supposed to fill it with...
and you struggle to keep that,
and you finish it off with a child.
People were always going on and on about...
how wonderful and fulfilling.
One even said...
you weren´t a real woman
unless you had a baby.
So I...
You did what you thought you should.
Like most women.
That was brave of you
She...
She took so much.
Everything.
And she would not be satisfied,
would not let me sleep.
Sometimes, like Sunday, all day.
I couldn´t... She just wouldn´t...
Nothing I did...
The screaming just went on and on
and on and on and on!
Then she was quiet.
I fell asleep.
I dreamed she...
Then shouting.
It was me.
I...
Why should I suffer for what she did to me?
I´m the victim!
Suffocated since the beginning!
Did you know where you were going to drive?
I´d seen the river before.
I´d dreamed about it.
I put her blanket in a skip.
I can show you where.
She was just supposed to be quiet,
but she wouldn´t wake up.
I walked back.
I thought I could hear her.
But the door was locked.
I had to break it.
I looked for her everywhere.
But I couldn´t find her.
I couldn´t find her.
I couldn´t find her.
I´m sorry!
I´m sorry.
- I´m sorry.
- Sh.
- I´m sorry.
- Sh.
- Sh.
- I´m sorry.
I´m sorry.
I´m sorry.
