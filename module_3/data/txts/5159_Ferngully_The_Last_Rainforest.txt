Our world was much larger then.
The forest went on forever.
We tree spirits nurtured the harmony
of all living things,
but our closest friends were humans.
Then, as sometimes happens,
the balance of nature shifted,
and Hexxus...
the very spirit of destruction...
rose up from the bowels
of the earth...
and rained down his poison.
The forest was nearly destroyed.
Many lives were lost,
and the humans fled in fear,
never to return.
Most think they didn't survive.
It was only by calling up
the magical powers of nature...
that I was able to trap Hexxus
inside an enchanted tree...
and save FernGully.
Which is why it is so important
for you to learn to use these powers.
I won't be around forever,
and you'll have to...
Crysta?
Yes.
That is why it is so important
for you to learn the secrets of...
- Crysta!
- Magi, yes. The secrets.
I know. But, I mean,
it's all right now.
That was so long ago, and you trapped
him in that tree and everything, so...
I really have to go now,
but I'll see you later, okay? Bye!
- Hey!
- Pips.
You know, you're spending more time
with Magi than you do with me.
Well, what can I learn from you?
- Hey!

There she goes.
Come on. Don't lose her.
- Okay.
- Crysta, stop!
Never, never go above the canopy.
Never go above the canopy.
Crysta!
Crysta!
I got ya.
Are you crazy, going above the canopy?
Yeah, we was almost falcon fodder.
- I've got to tell Magi.
- Tell Magi what?
Hey, wait!
What'd you see... up there?
- Halt! Who goes there?
- Hi, Crysta!
- Okay, what's the password?
- Come on, you guys.
- Is that the password?
- It sounds good.
- Bye.
- "Bye." That's it! That's the password!
Well, I don't know if that's the
password or not. I'm so confused, you...
Magi? Magi.
Magi, I just saw the most
incredible thing above the canopy.
A whole other world.
The sky went on forever.
And way over in the distance
as far as I could see,
there was this enormous rock like a...
Mountain.
That was Mount Warning.
And next to it was a... a...
I don't know.
It looked like a strange black cloud
rising out of the earth.
- Smoke, I should think.
- What's smoke?
There are many things in our world
you don't yet know about, Crysta.
There are worlds
within worlds, Crysta.
Everything in our world is connected by
the delicate strands of the web of life,
which is balanced
between forces of destruction...
and the magic forces of creation.
Help it grow.
Why can't I do it?
Everyone can call on
the magic powers of the web of life.
You have to find it in yourself.
I want to, Magi.
You know I do.
But I was thinking about that smoke.
Do you think
it could be... Hexxus?
No, there isn't a force in
nature that could release him,
and there are no poisons here
on which he can feed.
Hexxus is trapped for all time.
Now that's enough for today.
- But what could have caused the smoke?
- Now, now, now, off with you.
But, Magi...
Hexxus.
So what did the Mag have to say, huh?
- She said I should get serious.
- 'Bout time.
And stop hanging around with
bug-brained layabouts like you.
Oh, no!
Red light.
Red light again.
Immediate clearance requested!
Immediate clearance!
- Oh, no!
- Where you goin'? Crysta!
Hello?
Bless your heart with magic light.
I give the gift of fairy sight.
What a strange little bug.
I did it! I did it!
Gravity works.
Poor guy.
Primary testing laboratory.
No! Pass the probe.
Graduate students,
all gather forward. No!
Love the haircut.
It's all right.
We won't hurt you.
- He's still a little confused.
- Clearly.
Hello, I'm a nocturnal
placental flying mammal,
a member of the family of pteropodidae,
or Ptero-didn't I.
If you can't tell, I'm a bat!
Yes, I am. And they used to
call me "Batty," Batty Koda.
Pleased to meet you. Bonjour.
And where are you from?
I just blew in from a biology lab.
I'm back, and I'm flappin' free.
Let me tell you a story,
and it's all about...
♪ Yo, the name is Batty
The logic is erratic ♪
♪ Potato in a jacket
Toys in the attic ♪
♪ I rock and I ramble
My brain is scrambled ♪
♪ Wrapped like an animal
But I'm a mammal ♪
All of our cosmetics
are non carcinogenic.
♪ I've been brain-fried, electrified
infected and injectified ♪
♪ Vivisectified
and fed pesticide ♪
♪ My face is all cut up 'cause
my radar's all shut up ♪
♪ Nurse, I need a checkup
from the neck up I'm Batty ♪
Seems to have no effect, Doctor. Get me
another one. Get me another animal!
♪ They used and abused me
Battered and bruised me ♪
♪ Red wires, green wires
Stuck 'em right through me ♪
♪ So hear my batty word and
exercise a little prudence ♪
♪ When dealing with... humans ♪
- Humans?
- Where?
No!
Lucy!
No, no, there are no humans.
- They're long gone.
- Vanished.
Definitely extinct.
They only exist in stories.
Excuse me.
- Charming.
- It's been lovely, but I gotta "hoon".
Adios, amigos!
Ding! Check, please.
Father, do you think it's possible?
Could humans still exist?
Now, Crysta.
Don't you think you're a little old
to believe in human tales?
Human tails?
Humans don't have tails.
They have big, big bottoms
that they wear with bad shorts.
They walk around going,
"Hi, Helen!"
Did you really see humans?
- Were they at Mount Warning?
- Masses of Homo sapiens.
Hey!
Where are you going?
Yeah, this territory
looks kinda familiar.
Fabulous day in the canopy, isn't it?
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Mount Warning.
I know where I am.
I know where I am.
Hey! You scared me there. For a minute I thought
you said you were going to Mount Warning.
Well, I did.
- But there are humans on Mount Warning!
- Exactly.
Fractured fig, fairy bug!
Come on!
Mount Warning is the last place in the
world a little bug like you wants to go.
Look at these!
You think nature did this?
Do you think I put this in
to get better reception?
No! Humans did this.
We should stay here.
It's nice here.
Come on! You got a great set of wings.
Let's just flutter for a while.
Batty?
Batty.
Well, come on!
My heart! Oh, my heart!
I can't go on. Help me!
My little wings can't make it.
Maybe you should wait here for me.
This is a fabulous idea.
I really think we should fly with that.
Only, why don't you stay here with me?
It's okay, really.
I'll be right back.
Why do I not believe you?
- How're you comin' in your quadrant, Pete?
- All done here.
How 'bout you, Willie?
Finito, good buddy.
How 'bout you, Zak?
Zak?
Zak?
Zak?
Zak!
Yeah, yeah.
What's the big deal?
You finished marking those trees yet?
I'm gettin' to it.
Don't have a cow. Sheesh!
- This city kid comes up here for a summer job.
- He doesn't take it seriously.
That kid don't belong in the woods.
Freaky.
Gotcha!
Hexxus.
Man!
Look out!
Bless your eyes with magic light, I give
the gift of fairy size... sight!
Lift! I need lift!
"Don't go!" I said. "Bad idea." I said.
But would you listen?
No. Don't listen to Batty.
Well, what have we here?
Shoes! Animals don't wear shoes.
- A human!
- A tree!
Take anything you want.
I won't tell the cops. Huh?
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- What is going on here?
- The monster... it tried to eat you.
- Monster?
- My friend and I saved you.
Oh, Batty. Batty?
Sonic interference.
What a nightmare.
I thought I saw a human.
Human!
That's a human?
Yes! Kill it! Restrain it!
Medicate it! Something!
Puff up. They hate that.
Back! Back!
Get back!
- Don't worry! I've got it scared.
- No! Stop!
- I have but one claw, but beware.
- Will you both just calm down?
He tried to kill you!
I did not! You did!
Hold on! The only thing
that tried to kill anybody...
was that horrible monster
in the forest.
"Monster"? What monster?
The one that ate the tree.
It was terrible.
Tree?
The leveler.
- Hey, am-am I dead?
- No.
We could fix that for ya.
- Then I must be dreaming.
- Nope.
Aw, sure. And what are you
supposed to be... some kind of fairy?
Of course I am. What about you?
Are you really a human?
Last time I checked.
Listen, fairy, it's been weird,
but I'm outta here,
this dream is history.
Check this out.

Well, any friend of a fairy...
Is a friend of mine.
Thanks a lot.
Man. You owe me a free
dinner after this one.
- Are you okay?
- What happened to me?
I'm three inches tall!
- I shrank you.
- You what?
Well, it was the most amazing thing.
Of course, it's not what the spell
is really supposed to do.
But Magi Lune will fix you.
You shrank me?
- Yeah.
- Catches on quick, doesn't he?
- We better buzz off. It's getting late.
- "Buzz off'?
I'm not buzzing anywhere.
Now, unshrink me, and I mean now!
- Well, I guess I could take a bash at it.
- "Take a bash"?
Actually, I'm just sort of learning.
Great! I've been shrunk
by an amateur.
I don't believe this.
Okay, come on. Bash away.
Okay!
What was done, now undo.
Return you to the form that's true.
Bbig ears.
Elephant! No, no, no.
Anteater! Orangutan!
Okay, okay, let me guess. A duck!
A duck! It's Darwin's grab bag!
Let me try again.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
- No, no, no!
Thank you, but I think maybe
we better go see this Magi.
I'm Zak.
- I'm Crysta.
- Nice to meet you.
You're going to love FernGully.
It's the most beautiful,
wonderful place in the forest.
Well, come on.
Batty can carry you.
Moi?
Not this little mammal.
Fly a human?
I'd rather suck wax fruit.
- Hey, Tony.
- What?
You see Zak anywhere?
No, his shift's about over.
He probably cut out early.
That's the problem with
the world today. People are lazy.
I heard that with my bad ear.
What is that?
Hey, Tony, you think the leveler
can handle this baby?
- Sure. That leveler eats everything.
- Kinda like you.
How many times a day
I gotta threaten your life?
Hexxus.
I've got so many things
I want to ask you.
Like, why have humans
returned to the forest?
And what was that monster
that tried to eat you?
That wasn't a monster.
That was a machine.
What's a "machine"?
It's a... a thing...
for cutting down trees.
That's terrible.
Only if you live in a tree.
I do live in a tree.
You didn't have anything
to do with that "machine," did you?
What, me?
No. No, no.
No, of course not.
How could I have anything to do
with something that eats trees?
Could it come to FernGully?
Oh, no, no. Of course not.
You've got nothing to worry about.
- Why?
- Because, um, it's trapped.
I know.
By those red marks.
- It can't go past them. Well, they must be magic.
- Yeah!
You know, you're pretty smart, fairy.
I want to learn magic like yours.
Yeah?
Well, here.
Come here.
What is it?
It's fire.
That's fire?
Careful!
Delicious.
A first-class smoke.
Mother's milk.
What is this delightful thing,
and how did I get out of that tree?
Of course... humans.
What wonderful creatures.
So clever, so helpful.
I must take this wonderful
human thing to...
FernGully.
New orders, boys.
You're going to FernGully,
and I want you there by morning.
By morning?
I don't know if we can do that.
You'll just have to work harder, then.
Double shifts. No breaks.
No breaks?
And make sure you got plenty of oil.
Roger that.
We'll give her the gas.
Hey, Tone, you know what this means.
Yeah.
Beaucoup overtime.
What a miraculous device.
I'm really getting the hang of this.
I do believe we are destined
to be soul mates.

- Hey!
- Any sign of her? - Let's go back.
- She's probably back home havin' dinner.
Yeah, or she's somebody else's dinner.
She's fine.
Now, keep looking.
- We're lookin', we're lookin'.
- Okay, yeah, we're lookin'.
- We're lookin'. What are we lookin' for?
- Look at us look. We're lookin'.

What are the trees like where you live?
Not like this.
I live in a city.
"City"?
Yeah... buildings,
traffic, roads,
lights... a city.
Most humans live in cities.
- There's not many trees there.
- But how can you live without trees?
- Easy.
- But trees give life.
They make the clouds,
the rain, the air.
We've got air.
Yeah, if you don't mind getting
all your minerals in one breath.
Don't you miss talking to the forest?
Can't say I've actually
talked with a forest before.
I do all the time.

So what about you, Crysta?
I mean, what do fairies do anyway?
- "Do"?
- Yeah, I mean, do you have jobs or anything?
What-What's a job?
Guess that answers that question.
Look, um, what do you do all day?
- Help things grow.
- Yeah? That sounds cool.
No, usually it's warm.
- No, no. Cool means hot.
- What?
Yeah. You know...
bodacious, bad, tubular.
Awesome use of the language, dude.
As in,
"You are
one bodacious babe."
And that's good.
I mean cool.
Yeah. We're communicating now.
Tubular.
Morning!
What are you doing?
Carving your name.
See? C-R-Y-S...
No, no, you mustn't do that.
Here.
- Can't you feel its pain?
- "Its pain"?
Yes.
Humans can't feel anything...
they're numb from the brain down.
Zak.
He doesn't understand.
Did I say something wrong?
So, which way to FernGully?
Isn't this great?
- What is this place?
- This is FernGully.
Hey, Crysta, what's this?
Careful, Stump.
He's a human.
- Hey!
- Hey, how does it taste?
- A "hoo-man"?
- Is this what we're lookin' for?
Let go of me!
- Crysta!
- Hey, that's my human!
Hey!
Oh, no!
I'm blind! Oh, no!
I can see!
It's a miracle!
Another perfect landing.
No worries. I'm okay.
Thank you for caring. It's just a few bruises.
- Nobody cares about me.
- I do, bat man.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- Only fools are positive.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive. I fell for it!
- I should have known!
- Come on, Zak.
Crysta, we were so worried about...
- What's that?
- Father, I'd like you to meet Zak.
- Hi.
- He's a bodacious babe.
- A what?
- He's a human!
Somehow I thought they'd be...
bigger.
Well, I had a little accident,
and he sort of shrank.
But just think...
humans back in the forest.
Yep, there goes the neighborhood.
- Be nice, Batty.
- First thing, all these trees go.
Then come your highways, then come your
shopping malls and your parking lots...
and your convenience stores,
and then come...
Price check on prune juice, Bob.
Price check on prune juice.
Crysta! Where you been?
I've been looking all over for ya.
Pips, you won't believe what I found.
Isn't he amazing?
Shouldn't we be charging
admission for this?
That's all you've got to say?
I been out all night,
and you want to show me
this weird creature here?
This "weird creature" is a human.
He's kinda small, ain't he?
Look out!
Pips, why don't you tell us
about your strange treasure?
Well, it's simple, really.
It's hard like stone,
yet it's hollow.
And, yeah, it has this, ...
it has this little vine
coming out of it and... and...
It's my stereo.
Look, I found it,
so I'll explain it, all right?
Okay.
Then what is it?
- Well, it's obviously, ...
- Yeah?
Obviously, it's, ...
Where are you going?
- It's alive!
- And it's noisy!
It's a recording of music.
Well, I don't know
what a recording is,
but I know what music is,
and that is not music.

Well, I guess I better go find
Magi and get you unshrunk.
- There's no hurry.
- No, I promised.
Let it wait till tomorrow.
Come here.
No, I've got to tell her
about you anyway.
Wait here. I'll be back
as soon as I can find her.
Can't you feel its pain?
Oil. The leveler.
Oh, no.
Run, little ones.
We'll catch up to you
in FernGully soon enough.
Magi?
Magi!
Magi, I've got so much to tell you.
I went to Mount Warning,
and I found a human.
Well, come on.
I want you to meet him.
Magi, what's wrong?
Magi, can you heal it?
A force outside of nature did this.
I can't heal it, and I can't stop it.
Zak can.
I know what did this, Magi.
A monster the humans fight.
Humans can stop it.
They have
these magic red marks that...
But Zak said...
Humans did it.
Humans did it all.
Crysta!
- Hey, what's goin' on, Zak?
- What are you talkin' about?
You know exactly what I'm
talkin' about... the forest.
- You know what's happening, don't you?
- What?
Good idea. Ask the human.
He may know.
- Crysta...
- You lied to me!
Crysta...
I wish... I wish
the human tales were true.
They're not here
to protect the forest.
They're cutting down trees.
They're destroying the forest.
And I was helping them do it.
Batty was right.
- I was?
- They're coming this way.
You can't stop them.
You'll have to leave.
The humans have released Hexxus.
Gather everyone in the circle.
You know, Zak, truth doesn't
always win friends,
but it certainly influences people.
You're not half bad for a hominid.
Father?
- Since the beginning of time,
- Father.
We have been the guardians
and the healers of the forest.
We have too long forgotten
the magic powers of nature.
The time has come
to call on them again.
All the magic of creation...
exists within a single tiny seed.
We must go to Magi.
Look for the hero
inside yourself, Crysta.
Look to the good and loving heart
in you and all others.
For just as every seed holds
the power and magic of creation,
so, too, do you...
and every other creature
in this world.
Magi, don't leave me.
I love you.
I'll always be with you.
We all have a power,
and it grows when it is shared.
Remember what you've learned, Crysta.
Magi.
I'm back!
Hexxus!
Tony, Ralph,
stop!
Come on!
Let... go!
Hey, it's safer in here.
Coming through!
A fairy fortification!
Crysta! Come on.
We gotta get everyone out of here.
- No!
- Crysta!
We can't. We've got
nowhere else to go.
This is our home.
Zak.
This is the last time
I save you, human.
No! No, Batty.
Batty, take me back to the leveler.
Are you crazy?
That's lemming talk.
Wrong channel!
O Caesar, Emperor of Rome...
Wrong channel!
Well, all right, gummy.
- We're goin' to war.
- Yes, that's it!
Back to the camp!
Batty, let's go!
Fasten your seat belts.
It's gonna be a bumpy night.
We're goin' in full throttle. That ought
to keep those rebel fighters off our tail.
Lock and load, gentlemen!
Time to rock and roll!
- Tora, tora, tora!
- No, no, no! Batty, to the cab!
Bogey, bogey! Bogey at 3:00!
Red Leader! Red Leader!
Did you see that? It looked
like some kind of flying rat.
Aye, aye, Captain.
I can't get enough speed.
We got no dilithium crystals.
No!
- Batty, watch out!
- This is gonna hurt.
- Oh, no!
- No!
Hey, Tone, there's a little man
on the windshield here.
Tony, Ralph, it's me!
It's Zak!
- Hey, Tone...
- Keep it moving, boy!
You need a set of your own wings.
Here's your first flyin' lesson, Zak.
Thanks!
I should've sprayed for pests.
Lovely wings.
So easily detached.
Yes!
What happened to the energy?
All the magic of creation
exists within a single, tiny seed.
- Crysta!
- No! No!
Crysta.
Come on!
Help it grow!
Come on, guys!
- Come on!
- Let's go! Follow me!
Crysta's gone.
Look!
We did it, Zak.
Now Hexxus can never harm
FernGully again.
But humans still could.
That's why I have to go back.
There's a part of me
that really wants to stay.
There's a part of you
that will always stay.
Remember, Zak.
Remember everything.
Keep the stereo, dude.
- Thanks, dude.
- Hey, he's not going already?
He was a nice guy.
- He just needed wings.
- What was done, now undo.
Return you to the form...
that's true.
Good-bye, Zak.
Batty.
I've shrunk!
- Zak!
- What happened here?
I will remember.
Guys, things have gotta change.
Crysta, help it grow.
