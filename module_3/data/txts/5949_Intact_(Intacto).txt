We hav e a Spanish client
cleaning us out
on table 1 2,
s eat number six.
The old man wants
to proceed as usual.
H e's wearing a blue blazer,
a purple-and-gold-striped tie.
Sorry. I took you
for someone els e.
29 black.
No winner.
- Federico?
- The y'v e gone.
How many laps
did you do today?
Six.
You're out of shape.
I'v e come to say goodby e.
The last couple of days...
I'v e woken up
with a pain in my chest.
I can't get my breath.
It won't be long now.
- You won't die of old age.
- You think someone could beat me?
You keep on playing...
Just looking
after the business.
With e v ery game,
you put it in danger.
Belie v e me,
I'm not going to los e.
The casino, the mone y,
the captiv es...
the y'll all be yours.
I don't want anything
I hav en't won.
You're going to do
the circuit?
You want to play
against me?
You hav e no chance.
Your gift isn't
strong enough.
You don't know that.
I'v e known you since
you surviv ed that earthquake.
Or was it maybe somebody els e
who took you under his wing,
who fed you, paid
your way through s chool,
- made you somebody--
- My luck sav ed me.
- You told me that.
- I won't sacrifice you.
I taught you
how to us e that luck.
Now you think you're
luckier than me, huh?
I'v e rais ed a fool.
Sit down !
You're the only one
I allow to s ee my face.
Hav e you had dinner y et?
No, not y et.
Grab a shower.
I'll buy you dinner.
I can't make it tonight.
Other plans.
You're leaving, Federico...
without e v en a hug?
Don't do it.
Your gift I dis cov ered,
and your gift I take away.
Now you can leav e.
Goodby e, Federico.
Now that the old man
has deactiv ated him,
we can put our hands on him
without getting jinxed.
SEVEN YEARS LATER
H is name's Tomas Sanz.
H e wasn't trav eling alone.
- What about this?
- Cut it open.
N urs e !
I put up with my mother-in-law
for three months.
She finally croaks and her associate
giv es her 500,000 pes etas.
But my wife los es the che ck.
She said it was all my fault,
that I was bad luck.
I blew up-- that fuck up
was suddenly my fault.
- Do you hav e a picture of her?
- I'll find one.
I kicked her out of the hous e.
She slammed the door
and all the papers
went flying up in the air.
Suddenly, a che ck
for 500,000 pes etas
comes landing on my lap.
What do you think of that,
Federico?
Am I lucky or what?
- Are you going to keep it?
- What?
The che ck.
- What do you think?
- Horacio Caparros,
you are a lucky man.
No.
Giv e it to me later.
It's Claudia.
Pick up the phone.
I found fresh meat
in that plane crash.
Well, too bad.
Since you're on v acation,
the y pass ed the file on to me.
Tough luck, huh?
This time,
it'll cost you double--
The y're not all dead?
All that for a measly
50 million pes etas.
Or half if he surviv es.
If he had signed up
for our life insurance plan,
he'd get fiv e
or six times as much.
That is 200
or e v en 300 million.
That's mone y.
Thank you.
Claudia !
H i, old man.
H ello.
Is that enough?
It's purely routine.
H e's under arrest for theft.
I know.
Will he get some mone y?
H e surviv ed
a horrific experience.
That mone y is his.
Wait until he's made
his statement.
Pleas e...
I just need to make sure
he signs it.
How much?
What?
How much will he get?
25 million.
Do you think that will make up
for such trauma?
That's what he was awarded.
Still a bargain
for the airline.
Two minutes...
- Good e v ening.
- Good e v ening.
- I'm with the insurance company.
- I need to frisk you.
Thanks.
I hav e the che ck.
Sign here and it's yours.
May I?
She's beautiful.
What will you do
with the mone y?
Excus e me?
How will you spend it?
You'll cash the che ck
in two days.
Yes.
It won't be of much us e
where you're going.
When I'm worried,
I take out my cards.
It kills time and
helps me clear my mind.
Sometimes, just shuffling them
makes my troubles go away.
If you draw an ace,
I'll get you out of here.
We're not betting anything.
Tomas Sanz,
you are a lucky man.
- Sure.
- Don't doub t it.
There's one chance in a million
for a plane to crash.
And for it to crash,
leaving you the only survivor
out of how many--
23 7 pass engers?
One chance in 23 7 million.
One more time.
No bets either?
You play for me
and you're a free man.
Play?
Play what?
Sorry, your time's up.
We're almost done.
So, will you sign it or not?
We'll place our first bet
with your compensation.
Then we'll play
with our gains.
In the end, we'll split
e v erything 50-50.
What if I los e?
- That won't happen.
- And what if it happens?
You're free to walk away.
How long will that last?
Two weeks at the most.
- I don't know how to play.
- Don't you worry,
you don't need any talent.
Just remember two things--
don't e v er touch me--
- Why not?
- Just a thing I hav e.
And ne v er take my picture.
We don't need any souv enirs.
Remember it.
Good e v ening.
Hav e the y started y et?
- No.
- Do you want to s ee his I D?
Yes. I don't know him.
The plane lost contact
with the control tower
1 2 minutes after takeoff.
The black box,
which was re cently retrie v ed,
should shed some light on
the e v ents pre ceding the accident.
The casualty figures stand
at 23 1 pass engers
and six members of the crew.
The only person aliv e,
Tomas Sanz,
was arrested...
Are you here
of your own free will?
What does it feel like
when a plane is going down?
- I was asleep.
- Come on.
- You're pulling my leg.
- What's this?
- What's that smell?
- Molass es.
That's his favorite.
Right.
Place your bets, pleas e.
I'm sorry.
Federico, you can't be here.
- H e's new.
- Get him started and go.
H ere.
What's this?
- No mone y bets.
- It's not mone y.
It's a jewel.
The indemnity of the only
survivor of the plane crash.
That's right...
- I knew I'd s een you before.
- I won't play against him.
E v en this won't do.
One of your fingers
would be a nice trophy.
- If he agrees, we're game.
- Good idea.
- So, Federico?
- Let's play.
- Wait!
- Forget it!
Come on, wait!
- What about my finger?
- You won't los e it.
- Right. Get lost.
- Thos e guys...
the y're fucking amateurs
who won a bingo game
or fell from the s e cond floor.
The y hav e no chance
against you.
- I won't do it.
- Fuck.
You surviv ed a plane crash, I helped
you get out of the hospital.
- Isn't that luck?
- And so what?
All you need in there
is luck.
But I'm not stupid.
You are lucky and
you can control that luck.
You're fucking insane.
Let me go
or I'll touch you.
Let me go.
Why do you think
you're the only survivor?
There were good people
on that plane.
What sav ed you--
a thief? God?
- Chance.
- That doesn't exist for you.
Your gift is to steal
other people's luck.
Otherwis e, you'd be dead.
- Right.
- I belie v e in you.
But if you don't,
there's nothing els e to say.
- You can keep the mone y.
- You mess ed up
be caus e of a finger
I would hav e wagered with you.
It's yours.
Place your hands on the table,
gentlemen.
Remov e the s carv es.
Do not mov e.
H ello?
H ello?
Are you still playing?
Who is this?
Are you still playing?
What do you think,
Federico?
You won't die of old age.
- What?
- With a bug on my head,
I made more in one night
than in a lifetime
of risking my ass !
You could hav e lost a finger.
- So could you.
- No.
After the y'd cut yours off,
I'd hav e taken off.
You can run away from them,
but not from me.
I'm glad you like the game.
How do we split that thing,
wis e guy?
Fall and winter for you.
Spring and summer for me.
Very funny!
I'll go look for a bedroom.
This is Ana.
Leav e a message at the tone.
H ello, Ana. It's me.
Are you there?
Ana...
are you there?
Okay, well...
nothing.
I hope you're well.
Thank God
you didn't come with me.
I shouldn't hav e taken
that damn plane.
I am glad that
we're both aliv e.
Very glad.
I miss you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come on, run !
U p! U p!
I can't do it.
I'm too old for that.
Come on !
Giv e it to me.
Come on, giv e it to me !
- Don't touch me !
- Giv e it to me !
Don't you e v er
touch me again. E v er!
I thought it was safe
to call from a payphone.
N ext time, just tell me,
and we'll do it
the smart way.
- What's her name?
- Ana.
- Is that the girl in the picture?
- Yes.
- Wasn't she going with you?
- She miss ed the plane.
How lucky.
How did she miss it?
We need a phone.
We hav e to tell the bullfighter.
Only fear makes
for a great fight.
For a real bullfighter,
it's not the fear of losing,
but the fear of suffering--
your own suffering and
that of thos e around you.
It is that fear that driv es you
to really fight.
Why quit?
You were ne v er injured.
I lost my fear
of the bull.
You can't fight the bull
without fear.
H ello.
H ello.
- Alejandro Dominguez.
- I know.
- Can I hav e a word?
- Giv e me a moment.
Sure.
This is not the first time.
- The alarm didn't go off.
- I always forget to s et it.
- It happens.
- I'm getting old. I forget things.
No need to justify yours elf.
Will it be long?
No, I'll be
right with you.
Thank you.
Leav e it there, pleas e.
Sara.
We found Tomas Sanz's
fingerprints in the car.
- And his accomplice?
- Nothing.
The doors and windows
hav en't been forced.
- How did the y get in?
- Through the walls...
or with a ke y.
Hav e you shown us
the whole hous e?
Dominguez has a clean re cord
and no conne ction
with thos e guys.
Okay.
Goodby e, little bull.
Goodby e.
Leav e me alone.
What the fuck were you going
to Martinique for?
I was fleeing.
And then what?
I was going to open
a business on the beach.
When we're done,
the Caribbean won't be a luxury.
What will we bet?
I hav en't de cided y et.
We'll be back for lunch
next month.
See you then.
Wait.
I'm going to stay.
Thanks for e v erything.
Good e v ening.
Good e v ening.
- You broke the window.
- What?
Turn around,
spread your legs
- and put your hands on the car.
- What's going on?
Did you hear me?
I'm going to handcuff you.
- Right arm first--
- No need to touch me.
- Behind your back.
- Quit touching me.
Let me go!
You'll do to me what you did
to your husband and daughter?
What?
The s car--
you are famous
among your colleagues.
You should be dead,
but you sav ed yours elf.
Where is Tomas Sanz?
Your good luck is
someone els e's mis ery, right?
- Tomas Sanz.
- Let's make a deal.
I take you to him,
and you forget about me.
You spent your insurance
mone y on that?
Will it do?
Yes.
What did Tomas do to you?
Wait till he reaches
the Jew.
- Who?
- The Jew.
H e surviv ed
a concentration camp
and liv es in a casino.
If he touches you,
your gift is gone.
You be come normal.
But I don't belie v e that.
We are the way we are.
Tonight, we'll play
with the captiv es--
morons who let us
bring them bad luck.
All you do is touch them
as much as possible
to steal the little luck
the y might hav e.
Then we roll the dice,
and the highest number wins.
It's going
to rain like hell.
You should hav e brought
warmer clothes.
Bad mummy...
What's wrong?
Don't you hav e
anything to say?
I D, pleas e.
FOR TH E DEATH OF A SPO U SE...
FOR TH E DEATH OF A C H ILD...
Place your bets, pleas e.
Is it authentic?
- What will we wager?
- My hous e.
What, now?
During the game,
think of something nice.
It'll go better
if you're relaxed.
Think of the good times
you'v e had in your life.
With Ana, for instance.
- Why don't you play?
- I don't hav e the gift.
Are you sure?
If you don't hav e it,
you're nobody.
- The guy with Tomas is older.
- Gentlemen, pick your captiv es.
The y should be here.
The next game's in two weeks.
- Let's go.
- No.
- You'd be out of the game for good.
- Pleas e, mov e forward.
This is the only way
to get to him.
The man with the gray hair.
The man with the gray hair,
pleas e mov e forward.
Come clos er to the window.
Pick the one that
turns you on the most.
The man with
the orange sweater.
The man with the orange sweater,
pleas e mov e forward.
The winner gets the wagers
plus the captiv es.
Scarv es.
Don't you worry,
this is the best part.
Well...
let's start.
Don't start y et.
Miss, mov e forward.
Your hand, pleas e.
Six and four-- 1 0.
Your hand, pleas e.
Three and two--
fiv e.
On the ground !
This game's inv alidated.
She was in the hospital
when I woke up.
It's all good.
- She pointed her gun at me twice.
- But she didn't arrest you.
You bitch !
You fucked me ov er.
You should hav e arrested him
after the game.
You don't des erv e your gift.
- What about this?
- It's ours. Put it away.
What's up with that?
- We wager people now?
- Got a problem with that?
That girl...
what will happen to her?
- She'll probably die from a cold.
- Come on.
I don't know.
The picture, the kiss--
she must hav e a crush on you.
What?
You stole her good luck through
the picture. She's yours now.
From now on,
we'll wager people's luck.
The more pictures,
the more luck for you.
You don't belie v e me, do you?
Some sickos like to wager
people's pictures.
It's the easiest way for you
to make mone y and leav e.
Well, I don't like it.
I won't play that way.
I don't s ee any other way.
It's up to you.
You accept it and stay,
or you go rob another bank.
But hurry up. That cop will soon
come to her s ens es.
- You asshole.
- I'm only taking care of business.
FILE: H ORACIO C APARROS
Place your bets, pleas e.
Wait for me in the woods.
Are you ready?
- Did you wager it all?
- I play to win.
The che ck too?
After tonight,
no more running away,
no more sleeping in the car
and eating shit.
After tonight, we're off
to U canca for the last game.
U canca?
What we'll win there
is way bigger.
It's a question of dignity,
of getting what you want
and earning respe ct.
I like that.
What, respe ct?
I like that you actually hav e
a reason for doing this.
When you win in U canca,
you'll be the luckiest man on earth.
And our work will be done.
You'll buy me a drink.
Or 1 0.
Now, try to concentrate.
E v eryone here would kill
to go to U canca.
Come on !
Faster!
Run !
Come on, run !
Go, go!
Only two left!
Go, go!
Stop, Alejandro!
You are the winner.
Federico?
Federico?
I want someone
to open the door for me.
It's wide open.
Can you drop me off
at the train station?
What is she doing here?
What the fuck
is she doing here?
Put that back where it was.
Put it in the briefcas e.
Sorry, but she's mine.
Get out.
Come on, beat it!
I'm sorry.
This should hav e
ne v er happened.
You wouldn't be here
if we had found Tomas.
Ana...
you hav e to help me.
Talk to me.
Let's start from the beginning.
Why didn't you
take that plane?
It didn't do you any good
to leav e him
and es cape the accident.
H e surviv ed too, and
look where that led you.
Your bad luck
is Tomas' fault.
H e can go to hell.
I don't belie v e you.
H e pre v ented me
from taking that plane.
At the airport, he said,
''I don't lov e you anymore.''
H e sav ed my life.
- What did you say?
- I don't lov e you anymore.
Is something wrong?
Why do we hav e a copy
of Caparros' file?
The court required one.
- What for?
- H is ex-wife filed a complaint.
H e committed suicide, but
she wants the insurance mone y.
And Van Kuipp Life
refuses to pay.
Van Kuipp Life?
It`s the insurance company
from the plane crash.
That`s mine.
Good evening.
- Are you Claudia?
- Yes, I am.
Wait, don`t hang up.
I hear you`re in charge
of Caparros` and Sanz`s files.
That`s right.
But I spoke with someone else
at the hospital.
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
Tough luck.
Tough luck... right!
What will happen to Ana?
We can get her back.
How so?
Wager and win
her picture back.
But the guy`s off to Ucanca.
- It belongs to someone else now.
- To whom?
Samuel Berg... the Jew.
How do you know?
He`s the fucking king of fate.
No one has survived
Ucanca in 30 years.
You bastard!
That`s where you were taking me!
You shouldn`t have lost.
That`s why I wagered Ana.
What`s the game?
You`re given a gun
loaded with five bullets.
You shoot first.
If you kill him, you win.
If not...
the Jew shoots.
Five to one...
could be worse.
The guy who got
luckier than you, died.
I make the decisions.
Who will you wager?
They took a plane to Ucanca.
Why are you
bringing me a loser?
Don`t play.
Gerard told me
you used his girlfriend
without his knowledge.
Nobody`s ever come here
out of love.
Your boy deserves to play.
I don`t usually talk
to the people who come to play.
But this time...
I want to make an exception.
Look at this.
Every morning, the door
of the barrack got opened,
and they took a few out.
First, the oldest...
then our parents,
then the brothers and sisters.
In a couple of weeks,
there were only
about 50 of us left--
all children.
Suddenly, they just
stopped coming.
Then...
one day...
a man appeared.
He was not a guard.
He was wearing...
a sand-colored suit.
Spotless it was.
And he held a black
handkerchief to his nose.
We didn`t smell
too good, you see.
And one by one, he took us
by the arm and...
jolted our numbers down
in his notebook.
We would be called
and reunited with our parents.
And then he left
and never came back.
But the guards returned.
They lined us up
and shouted a number.
I looked at my arm...
it wasn`t me.
It was one of the others.
And as he walked through the door,
he turned and
looked at us all,
thrilled to bits
that he had won...
and disappeared.
And so on.
Every day, another number.
Or two.
Or none.
Sometimes they would just
stand, looking at us,
and then leave.
In the end, only Daniel
and I were left...
for four days alone.
And we talked.
We talked a lot.
Daniel knew things.
He used to help his father
at the watchmaker`s shop.
Did you know that...
if you stare at
the minute hand hard enough,
you can see it move?
That photo is of Helena,
his sister.
Daniel knew that
it wasn`t our parents
who would wait
for us outside.
And the day
the door opened again,
I took my friend`s hand...
and I closed my eyes,
willing it not to be my number.
When Daniel let go of me,
I couldn`t open my eyes again.
I didn`t want to look
at him face to face.
He just said to me,
``It`s yours,``
and walked off.
And...
he left the photo
in my hand.
The next time
the door opened...
the uniforms had changed.
Well, if you`re ready,
I think it`s time to play.
I found an elevator
leading to the basement.
Roberto?
Carlos, Javier,
can you hear me?
Federico, you have to go.
Have faith.
Remember that
you came out intact.
I don`t love you anymore.
Let`s get out of here!
Your work is done.
Leave now.
God damn it, Federico,
our work is done.
Come on.
We won.
No, you won.
Take care of yourself.
Sara? Are you there?
To my father
