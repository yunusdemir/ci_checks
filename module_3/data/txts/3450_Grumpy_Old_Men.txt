SNYDER:
Mr. Gustafson, I have to talk to you.
Mr. Gustafson, will you answer
the door, please?
I know you're in there.
It's no use pretending
this isn't happening, Mr. Gustafson.
I can't keep coming back here
every couple of days.
You have to talk to me.
Mr. Gustafson, I'm just trying to help you.
Come on, answer the door.
I'm just gonna keep knocking.
I'm gonna keep ringing the bell,
so you might as well answer the door.
[DOORBELL RINGING]
We know you're in there.
Think of the neighbors, Mr. Gustafson.
There's a letter for you,
Mr. Gustafson.
I suggest you read it.
- Morning, dickhead.
- Hello, moron.
What are you, uh...
Never mind. Just forget it.
- Who's the guy yakking at your door?
- Mind your own business.
[MOCKING TONE]
"Mind your own business."
- Tie your shoelace. You'll fall.
- Aw, shut up.
We're having a heat wave here.
[SINGING "HEAT WAVE"]
Somebody moving
into the old Clickner place.
[MOVERS CHATTERING]
- Gee, you picked up on that, Sherlock.
SNYDER: Excuse me.
I wonder if you gentlemen
could tell me...
...uh, where I could find Mr. Gustafson?
No. Gustafson? No, no, sorry.
- Mr. John Gustafson?
- That's right.
[MAX MUTTERING]
You mean the lowlife, ass-wipe...
...egg-sucker John Gustafson?
- Oh.
Have you seen him?
Man's crazy. Loco.
Always hanging out around
those kinky strip bars.
- What?
- Where men take their clothes off.
Oh, for God's sake.
That's, of course,
if he's taken his medication.
Medication?
Yes. Without it,
he could be anywhere.
Wandering around, talking to the trees.
Believe me, this man is a menace.
He's always drinking, starting fights.
Isn't that right?
- But have you seen him?
- No, sorry.
I think, perhaps...
Um, no.
- No. No.
- No.
If you see him...
...would you give him this
and tell him he must contact...
...Mr. Snyder as soon as possible.
- Yes. Uh-huh. Okay.
- Schneider.
- Snyder.
That's me. It's important.
Important? Yes, sir.
We'll tell him when we see him.
[MAX LAUGHS]
[JOHN LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY]
[GRUNTS]
- Oops.
- Oh, look out!
Watch out for that ice there.
Slippery. Very slippery.
Right.
Holy moly.

[CHUCKLING]
Idiot.

That's just great.
[PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
MAN [ON TV]: Remington MicroScreen
Rechargeable Shaver so much...
...I bought the company.
It shaves as close as a blade,
or I'll give you your money back.
The first microscreen is so thin
it shaves incredibly close.
The second even closer.
Remington's American...
You should have seen Mrs. Carlson's face
when he said, "It's a keeper."
Oh, cold enough for you? Brr!
Oh, shut up, fat-ass.
It's not even Thanksgiving, and here
we are enjoying our lovely fall weather.
Six inches of snow
on the ground already...
...with traveler's advisories
in effect throughout our area tonight...
...you'd be advised to stay inside
and have yourself...
...a warm, home-cooked meal.
How'd you like a clue
for what's coming up this week?
It's snow, snow, and more snow.
We've got snow coming into
our area all week long.
Come Sunday afternoon,
another cold front...

[SAW BUZZING]
[JOHN LAUGHS]
You're still using
that beat-up piece of firewood?
The Green Hornet's caught more fish
than you've lied about, Gustafson.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You see her?
- Huh?
Drives pretty fast on that snowmobile.
- Pretty damn fast.
- Yeah.
Did you hear about Eddie Hicks?
Hypothermia's a bitch.
Not quick like a stroke.
A stroke is no damn good.
You could end up like a vegetable.
Give me a cardiac any day.
MAX:
You know what Jacob said?
Jacob said that old Billy Hinshel
was killed in a car crash.
Head-on collision with a freight truck.
Cleared his car straight over the bridge
into the Mississippi.
Lucky bastard.
You bet.
Hey, how is he anyway?
He's dead. Died on impact.
Jacob, moron. Jacob.
Oh, ah, he's fine.
Doing real good. Real busy and everything.
But he promised to come over
for Thanksgiving.
Is he really gonna run for mayor?
- Make a damn fine mayor, too.
- Good thing he's his mother's son.
If he looked like you,
he'd never get on the ballot.
Eat my shorts.
MOVER: Morning, Mrs. Truax.
ARIEL: Morning, how you doing?
MAX:
Holy moly.
MOVER: Watch your step, ma'am.
ARIEL: Thank you.

[DOOR CHIMES]
I hit the cans again.
I heard.
How is the Grinch today?
Ain't got a pot to piss in
or a window to throw it out of.
CHUCK:
Ha, ha. Can I get you something?
Yeah, I need a six-pack of Schmidt
and I'm out of bait.
- Shiners or wax worms?
- I can't afford shiners. Give me wax worms.
Wax worms are 75 cents.
75 cents? Crime in Italy. Chuck,
we're talking about worms, not caviar.
You go through that every time.
Where are you gonna get worms this
time of year? It's supply and demand.
You could retire in Florida
just from selling me worms.
- And throw the beefjerky in too.
- That's $5 for the beer and the worms.
Now you know your old gut
can't handle no jerky.
God...
Hey, is Pop out there at the shanty?
Always.
Uh-huh. And the moron?
There's lots of ice out there, Gustafson.
Should be room enough
for the both of you.
JOHN [IN MOCKING TONE]:
"Lots of ice out there, Gustafson."
Mm-mm-mm.
[HORN HONKING]
- Hi, Dad.
GRANDPA: Hi, hi.
Any luck today?
How the hell should I know?
I just got here.
JOHN: Oh.
- Say, Mel, she came by the other day...
...and said that you'd been snapping.
JOHN: Oh.
- Like a damned catfish.
- Well, I've had a lot on my mind lately.
I'll tell you what's on my mind.
It's butt-cold out here
and I'm fresh out of beer.
Oh, did you hear? Someone moved into
the Clickner place. Awoman.
- Awoman?
- Yeah.
- Did you mount her?
- Oh, Dad.
No, wait a minute.
Has she got big thighs?
- No.
- No?
Then what's the problem?
If I was a young fellow like you,
I'd be mounting...
...every woman in Wabasha.
Keep the change.
Hi, Punky.
Hi, John.

Hi.
Oh, my God. I, uh...
You see, I was...
Hi.
I hope you don't mind,
but I saw your light on...
...and I was just wondering
if I might use your bathroom.
What?
- So, uh, your toilet is broken?
- Oh, no, thank goodness.
I don't know, the house seemed so empty
tonight. I do so love bathrooms.
You know, you can tell a lot
about a person from his bathroom.
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.
- There's a guest bath...
- I can't wait to see what I find in there.
- Much better than having your palm read.
- Well, uh...
You give me 30 seconds
in a person's bathroom...
...and I will give you a complete
and accurate profile.
- There's a guest bathroom, please.
- I'll only be a minute.
Ah. Guest bathroom.
[TOILET FLUSHES]
So?
Fascinating.
Uh...
Now, don't you think it's time
that you finally introduced yourself?
- Oh, uh...
- John "Goostafson," right?
- Gustafson.
- Gustafson.
Well, I took some of your mail yesterday
just to find out who you were.
But you don't get much and
what you do get doesn't paint a picture.
- You took my mail. That's a federal offense.
- I know.
Sometimes it's necessary to go
a long distance out of the way...
...in order to come back
a short distance correctly.
- Don't you find that too? I love that line.
- What?
I have to confess it's not mine.
It's from The Zoo Story by Edward Albee.
I teach American literature
at Winona State University.
I started yesterday.
Oh, I love the classics, don't you?
- Yeah. Well, I also read Field & Stream.
- Indeed?
You have a whole library
up there from what I could see.
You know, there's something really rugged
and virile about the outdoors, isn't there?
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
My manners. I'm so sorry.
I'm Ariel Truax.
[STUTTERING]
How do you do? I'm John G-Gustafson.
- Yes, I know.
- You know that.
When did you
move into the Clickner place?
Oh, I'm sure you know that, John.
Ever since I got here,
you and Max Goldman...
...have been stuck up against your windows
watching me like two Garfield cats.
You know, those kind that
people stick to their car windows?
You know, those little
suction cups they have? It's so...
Squirrels.
Been watching the squirrels. One of them's
making a nest under your eaves.
Sure, John.
Here's your mail.
Now, there's nothing addressed
to a Mrs. Gustafson.
And by the state of your bathroom,
I presume that you're a bachelor.
Yeah.
Gay or straight?
- Huh?
- Heterosexual or homosexual?
Jeez Louise.
It's a perfectly legitimate question.
[LAUGHING]
Well, maybe in California,
but here in Minnesota... Ho-ho.
Have I upset you?
No, hey.
It's the middle of the night
and I don't know what the hell is...
Would you like me to leave?
No.
Yeah.
Well, it was very nice meeting you,
John Gustafson.
And now that we know each other,
don't be a stranger, neighbor.
Oh, and John...
...king's rook to queen's bishop 3.
Ah.
[HORN HONKS]
MAN:
Hey, John.
Phil, wait a minute.
Don't ring that up yet.
I need something for my lumbago.
The pain is killing me.
Ah, it's killing you, my ass. He doesn't
know the meaning of the word pain.
l got a pinched sciatica that makes
your lumbago look like eye strain.
Pain. He wants to talk about pain.
I had a gallstone the size of a baseball.
Gallstones, yeah.
Gallstones are for pussies.
When I had shingles
did you see me complaining to Phil?
Shingles schmingles.
When I had my ulcers, I was...
...farting razor blades.
- Good morning, John.
- Huh? Good...
Oh, you must be Max Goldman.
Hi, I'm Ariel Truax, your new neighbor.
- Pleasure.
- Isn't it a peach of a day?
- Ah.
ARIEL: Listen, I have something for you.
It was dropped off
at my house by accident.
Some of your mail. Heh.
- Here you are. Sorry.
- Ah.
Phil, have my herbal therapy oils
arrived yet?
They arrived this morning.
Special delivery from California.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Ah, yes, there's nothing like the scent of...
...fresh tea tree...
...just soaking into your pores.
- Hmm.
Don't you agree?
Lovely.
Thank you.
It was such a pleasure meeting you...
...and I'm sure we're going to see
a lot of one another.
Goodbye, gentlemen. Goodbye, John.
Yeah.
[DOOR CHIMES]
- Holy moly.
JOHN: Uh-huh.
JOHN: Now wait. You got all
four wheels on the track? Okay.
All right. Now, careful, fellas, huh?
Hey, Mel.
Be careful. That's over 1 00 years old.
Damn thing might collapse.
- Hi, sweetheart. How are you?
- Hi, Dad. Good.
JOHN: There's Granddaddy's little girl.
- What's going on?
- I'm getting rid of that. It's just firewood.
- Why?
Well, I don't know. I don't play it much.
It sits around, collects dust.
- You love that piano.
- Granddaddy's got a surprise...
...for you in the house, pumpkin.
- Dad.
Oh, just a little C-A-N-D-Y.
It's not going to kill her.
ALEXANDRA:
Candy.
Which one?
Okay, which hand?
This one? No.
Which hand? That's the one. Yeah.
There you are, sweet pea.
How about that? Here.
Dad.
- Is there something wrong?
- No. Nothing's wrong at all.
With me...
Now, Mel, um...
How am I gonna...?
People are asking about you.
I know.
Yeah, now I keep telling them
that you and Mike are doing just fine.
It's just a lot of gum-flapping.
- Mike and I aren't fine.
- Yeah. That's what I thought.
Dad, we're gonna separate for a while.
Honey, marriage isn't easy, you know.
You gotta work at it.
It's hard to work at it
when he's never there.
Oh, my God, is that familiar. Your mother
wondered where I was for 20 years.
You really think I wanted two jobs?
I didn't do that for me.
- I was doing it for you, Brian, your mother.
- Dad. Dad.
Dad, this isn't about you.
This is about me and Mike.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I-I get... I keep...

I'm sorry. I love you so much.
Well, whatever you and Mike decide is...
I never liked him anyway.

Max was telling me

What? My new neighbor?
Oh, yes, yeah, new neighbor.
Yeah, she came over to see me last night.
She what?
Yeah, about 1 :30 in the morning.
Why would a woman come over
at 1 :30 in the morning to see you?
Just why do you think, bonehead?
I'll have a six-pack, Chuck.
Ha. Women and fish...
...you can never
catch either one of them, Gustafson.
I've laid more pipe in this town
than Wabasha Plumbing.
Oh, yeah? Now you're telling me
you're going to go after her?
Oh, me? Oh, jeez. God, no. She's too...
She's too disturbed for me.
For you maybe.
No, I don't wanna have
anything to do with her.
See, women fall too hard for me.
They get obsessed with me.

Yeah, he's a regular Don Juan.
No wonder the ladies "Don Juan"

I'm out. I am out.
Hey, Max, will you say hello to Jake for me?
Why don't you come over

There's always plenty of bird

And I got a black eye for my effort.
- Let me get that.
- There you go.
I always knew, you know.
Knew what?
That you had a crush on me
since 6th grade.
You used to watch me

- What?
- Mm-hm.
No. I...
You never wondered why my curtains
were open just enough?
I thought I was lucky.
I just did it to torture you. Ha, ha.
Yes. Well, you succeeded wonderfully.
How come you never asked me out?

Oh, man. I better run. See you.

- Good.
- They're getting a divorce.
- Huh?
Mel and Mike, they're getting a divorce.
They call it a separation, but it's divorce.
- Gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.
So are you seeing anyone special, are you?
Me? Mmm...
- No, I guess not. Nobody serious.
- What do you know?
We got a new neighbor, did you hear?
JACOB: Everyone in town
is talking about this woman.
Yeah. Gee, she hasn't
been out since 11 :20.
What are you doing? Clocking her, John?
Well, she keeps odd hours, you know.
Very interesting woman.
Sounds like a wacko to me.
I haven't had sex for 1 5 years.
Could I have little? Oh. Mmm.
[BURPS]
GRANDPA: Oh, my.
MELANIE: Too much, Dad?
Yeah, that was plenty.
Hey, why don't you give some of
the leftovers to Jakey?
He'll have his own leftovers.
That pre-cooked stuff his old man gets?
That tastes like cardboard.
Why don't you go and talk to her, Dad?
What? Talk to who?
Ariel.
You spent half the meal
staring out the window.
Just squirrels.
There's the squirrels on her roof.
That's what I was staring at.
You're a handsome, eligible guy
with a nice house, a good pension.
You got a lot to offer her.
Well, I got something to offer her.
[GROWLS]
I got zip to offer her.

Pop, I can't tell if this is done.
Pop, do you know how many minutes
this thing needs to cook?
Getting hungry.
Sure be nice to have some turkey
right about now.

MAX: Double overtime.
- Blackhawks were killers, weren't they?
- Did you catch the game, Chuck?
No.
Oh, sure, you were with

Yeah. How was the turkey at the VFW
this year, Chucky?
The turkey this year...
...was delicious. Ha, ha.
Yeah...
- Oh, come on.
- We saw you.
- You were there half the night.
MAX: What'd you do?
- What's it like in there?
- What did she say?
Fellas. Fellas.
There are some experiences
in life too rich...
...too beautiful to try
to put into words.
- What does that mean exactly?
JOHN: Yeah.
Could have been either of you
if you just had the guts to ask.
- You mean, you and she...?
- I'm not talking about sex, dummies.
JOHN: No?
- Of course not.
Oh.
I get it.
Your old pal failed you, huh, Chuck?
Oh, couldn't rise to the occasion?
- Yes, the spirit was willing...
- Yeah, but the flesh was, uh...
Weak, weak.
Okay, okay, if it wasn't sex what was it?
It was an awakening.
Ariel reminded me that I was alive.
That I was a man full of energy,
love, and passion.
It was like being young again.
If only for a moment.
Couldn't get it up, huh, Chuck?
Get out of here, both of you.
Yeah, I'll see you.
Yeah, but...
[STAMMERS]
MAX: So long.
CHUCK: Hey, boys.
That's not just a woman
living across your street.
She's an angel.
Angel, right. Take it easy, Chuck.
See you, Chuck.
[LAUGHING]
[YELPS]
[SCREAMS]
[TALKING INDISTINCTLY]
MAX:
Holy moly.
Look at all the crap you...
Excuse me. The stuff you got here.
ARIEL: Well, it's my inspiration.
- You did...? You're an artist?
Ah, I try.
I used to teach courses
in Expressionism at Berkeley.
But now I'm back to
the classics of literature.
Berkeley, that explains it.
Oh, my God.
ARIEL:
What?
Your TV. It's got no guts.
I took them out.
How could you do that
to a '54 Super Zenith?
This TV is a classic.
I can fix it for you though,
if you wanted me to.
That's what I used to do.
I was a TV repairman.
Aw, that's so sweet, Max, but...
...you know, I think it works quite well...
...just the way it is.
How the hell does she see any shows?
Holy moly.
ARIEL:
I see you've met Ernest.
- Who?
- The model was my husband.
Boy, he sure wasn't pleased about
modeling in the nude.
Took quite a bit of prompting, I must say.
He's, uh...
Passed on.
Five years ago.
Hmm. Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah.
- Cream and sugar?
Yeah.
Hmm.
[GROANS]
Sure moved around a lot
the last few years, didn't you?
Yeah, I think it's exciting
to experience new things...
...new places, and meet new people.
Like you.
Do you paint?
- Paint? Me?
- Yes. Uh-huh.
Sure do.
I paint the shed every spring.
- Ha-ha!
- No. No.
- You get it?
- I get it, I get it.
No, I mean, you know...
...pictures, paintings.
What for?
Everyone needs some form of...
...release.
I fish.
Fish?
Fish...
Oh. Yeah, fish.
Oh, yeah. I can see the beauty in that.
- Yeah?
- Mm.
Miss Truax,
would you do me the honor...
...of accompanying me
to my ice shanty tomorrow?
I'd be honored.
[TALKING INDISTINCTLY]
MAX: See you tomorrow.
ARIEL: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[BOTH LAUGH]
ARIEL: Be careful.
MAX: Okay.
[MAX SINGING "HEAT WAVE"]
Whoa!
- I can't hold it!
MAX: Reel him in.
ARIEL: I can't hold him, Max.
- Work him. Work him.
ARIEL: I'm trying. He's so strong!
MAX: Easy does it.
MAX: Reel it in.
- I can't hold it.
- I'm trying but I can't!
- All right. Give me the pole.
Oh, not yet. Not on your life.
Get out of here!
- Let me... Pull!
- Stop!
[ARIEL & MAX SHOUTING]
[ARIEL SCREAMING]
MAX: That's it. Coming. Coming.
ARIEL: Aah! Aah!
Morning, John.
[ARIEL & MAX SHOUTING]
Morning, Punky.
ARIEL: Oh, Max.
MAX: Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- Oh, I almost lost him.
- Max, oh, he's just magnificent.
Magnificent? He's a damn record-breaker.
You've got a 3-footer.
Oh, Max.
I can see the beauty in this now.
- Can you see it?
- Yes, the lure. No, the fight.
- The fight. Wait till I show the guys.
- The catch.
- What a catch.
- And then the release.
The release!
- What release? There's no release.
- Oh, yes, it's beautiful.
No, I'll tell you what's beautiful.
This monster on my wall stuffed.
Oh, no. There can be no stuffing.
This is a live creature.
Full of courage and life.
Nobody's gonna believe me.
Let me get a camera.
- Oh, no.
- Just hold it for a minute.
- I hear the water calling it back, Max.
- Where is it?
ARIEL: Here we go.
- Wait, wait!
- Calling.
- Here. Hold it. Hold it!

Hey, Pop.
Hey. Just finishing breaKfast.
So I see.
Colder than a witch's titty out there,
isn't it?
Where did you get this fishing pole?
GRANDPA:
Oh, I snagged it about an hour ago.
The only damn thing I caught all day.
Ah.
Hey, Chuck, guess what Pop found.
[JOHN CHUCKLES]
Chuck?
Chuck? Hey, Chuck!
Ch... You forgot to unlock
the back door, you dummy.
[DISPATCH RADIO CHATTERING]
Isn't it wonderful to have
a little adventure every day?
All I know is you're one hell
of a fisherman, Ariel.
Oh. I learned from the best.
Oh, I hope you weren't mad at me
for putting them all back.
Ah, that's okay.
Gustafson does the same thing.
He just keeps the ones he eats.
That's what he says.
I think he never catches them.
- Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha. Oh, Max.
I think we're going to be great friends.
Oh, fr... Fr...
Friends. Friends is good.
That's good, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.
How about some supper tonight?
After your class, I mean.
Oh, thank you so much, but I already
have made plans. I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- But I'll take a rain check.
- That's a deal.
- Okay?
Yeah.
Until we meet again, my dear Ariel.
Yes.
- Ha, ha.
- Goodbye.
Watch out. Don't slip.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, Gustafson,
looks like the best man won.
Ah. You always were a lousy loser.
[GRUNTS]
He's dead.
- What? Who?
- Chuck.
Chuck? How?
Last night in his sleep.
In his sleep.
Lucky bastard.
Of course, you might have known
if you hadn't been out with that minx.
Hey, it ain't my fault.
Chuck was a friend of mine too.
You call yourself a friend?
You bastard.
Hey, watch your mouth,
you dumb frigging Swede.
Look, don't tell me what to do, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Big man with the ax in your hand.
Ax? All right, fine. You wanna clock me?
You think you can take me? Come on.
- All right. 1 937, at Todd Field...
- Oh, for God's sake.
...I kicked your ass after football practice
when you stole my liniment.
- I kicked your ass and I can do it again.
- Bullshit.
Give it your best shot, shrimp.
It's not worth the effort.
Get out of there.
[SIGHS]
Damn.
He has the intelligence quotient
of a newt.
[GRUNTS]
Shrimp thinks
he can get funny with me.
Left hook...
...right cross...
...and dump him.
Oh, Chuck.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
I'm gonna kill him.
God damn you, Goldman, you...
John Gustafson?
I'm Elliot Snyder

I'm asking you
to accompany me to my office.

- Oh!
- Hi.
[GASPS]
I was wondering where you were.
I, uh...
I had a little, uh, business.
Oh, I hope it went all right.
Yeah. Uh, wh... What are you doing?
Cooking. Ha, ha.
Cooking. Yes, yeah. That's...
Oh, wait a minute.
I can't have anything spicy.
I mean, if it's too exciting, I'm up all night.
Good. I'm making Sichuan.
Ah, gotcha.
From the moment I saw you, I could feel
that we had the same kind of aura.
- That we share something special.
- Teaching.
Thirty-nine years I taught American history
at Wabasha High.
Oh. History, it's so romantic.
Great dental plan.
[LAUGHS]
All the ideas that you brought
to those young minds.
Yeah, the kids think they know it all, right?
Oh, once in a while you reach one.
You touch them somehow.
- I did that once.
- Really?
It was my Roosevelt's New Deal lecture.
I touched a kid on the back of his head
while he was snoring.
- Ha, ha.
- You're so bad.
[LAUGHS]
You know, uh...
- Chuck, he...
- Mm.
- I know.
- Oh.
We can be thanKful that
we had the privilege of knowing him...
...while he was here.
Yeah.
To Chuck.
Yes, to Chuck.
Thank you, John.
It was a wonderful evening.
Thank you, Ariel.
- Now, Pop, you think I should I call her?
- What?
- What?
- The woman.
Well, let me tell you something, John.
That the first 90 years or so...
...they go by pretty fast.
- Ha, ha. Yeah?
- What?
- The first 90 years, they go by pretty fast.
Yeah, but how would you know?
You're just a damn kid.
Well, I didn't say it, you did.
- Well, they do. They go fast.
- Okay. All right.
- Then one day you wake up...
- Yeah?
...and you realize...
...ha, ha, that you're not 81 anymore.
And then you begin to count the minutes
rather than the days...
...and you realize
that pretty soon you'll be gone.
And that all you have, see,
is the experiences.
That's all there is, Johnny.
Everything. The experiences.
You mount the woman, son. Ha, ha.
Or else, uh...
...send her out to me, huh?
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I happened to come by
these two tickets for the Gopher game.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
So, Ariel, uh...
...ever play much ice hockey?
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ah, schmuck.
SNYDER: Mr. Gustafson.
Mr. Gustafson. We had an appointment.
JOHN:
There she is. Wabasha.
ARIEL:
Hmm.
It is just beautiful.
Yeah. Yeah, from up here. I used to
camp out up here when I was a kid.
What are you thinking?
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...
It's the snow.
Reminded me of the Iast Christmas
I spent with my husband.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, an angel.
- What?
- I'm making a snow angel, remember?
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I remember.
ARIEL:
Whoo!
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Hey.
Do you believe in angels?
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh?
- Oh, they're all around us.
- Yeah?
Mm-hm. You've got to look hard
but they're there...
...whenever anything good happens to us.
I think I see one.
[BOTH LAUGHING]

Papa's bald spot is.

MAN 2 [ON TV]: Give it all you've got.

Aha.
I'll have you mated in three moves.
Shouldn't we get to know each other
a little better first?
Oh, you have a wonderful smile.
You should wear it more often.
Yeah? L... I...
I bring it out on special occasions.
Heh.
Hmm.
Tell me, who's this?
- What?
- Over here.
- Oh, that's my dad. That's Pop.
- Oh.
The handsome guy right behind him.
You know him, I think, don't you?
My daughter Melanie and her mother,
and Melanie and her husband, Mike.
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah.
Now, these people over here?
Ah, the little girl is Alexandra,
my granddaughter.
- And my son, Brian.
- Oh, he's so handsome.
Lost him in Vietnam.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay. It's all right. It's okay.
And these little guys.
- Oh, ha. That's me and the moron.
- Max?
- Of course it's Max. He's ugly isn't he?
- Ha, ha!
ARIEL:
Oh, you mean you were friends?
Well, I was 1 0. I didn't know any better.
What can make two grown men spend
most of their lives fighting each other?
- Oh, guess.
- Awoman.
- Uh, yeah.
- How romantic.
Oh, no, it wasn't romantic at all.
It was... Ah, well.
What did I know? I was just a kid.
Which I am not anymore.
I think it's kind of late.
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. I guess...
It's time for bed.
[WHISPERS]
God, you are dumb, dumb, dumb.
Ariel, I'm sorry that...
I thought you said...
I said it's time for bed.
- Well, wait a minute. What about...
- What?
Well, you know, you've been seeing...
- Max?
- Yeah, Max.
He's just my friend.
Uh, yeah, but, uh...
The last man that I slept with
was my husband.
Uh...
Oh, God. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute.
I'm not prepared.
See, these days, they say
you have to do safe sex.
John, when was the last time
you made love?
October 4.
1 978.
Oh, I think we're safe.

You can shove that pole.
You think a lousy old pole
is gonna replace her?

Are you crazy?

Don't egg him on. Go back to your fishing

Look at that.
What the hell has gotten into you?
- You stole her, didn't you?
- What?
She's mine.
- Says who?
- Says me.
Yeah? Well, she came to me.
Bull. You're trying to steal
her away, just like you did May.
Oh, for God's sake. Could I remind you,
Einstein, May was no prize.
- She was to me.
- I was married to the woman 20 years.
- She was no prize.
- She was to me.
Yeah. Well, that's why you're a moron.
If you'd ended up with May...
...you never would have had Amy.
And Amy was a good woman.
- She was the best.
- And more loyal than May ever was.
- Absolutely.
- So.
- So what?
- Huh?
What?
- Huh?
- So?
What?
- What?
- What?
Did you...
Well, did you?
What?
You know.
- Oh, that's a private matter.
- Private, my foot. Did you?
- That's all I can tell you.
- You better tell me.
All right, we did the horizontal mambo!
We danced it!
It was the greatest sex I ever had
in my life. All right, are you happy?

Hey! Drop that fish.

Now go to your shanties, all of you.
You're scaring the fish away.
Damn kids.
GRANDPA: Kids. You can't live with them,
can't shoot them.
How you gonna take care
of her, huh, Gustafson? Huh?
How are you gonna support her
when the IRS takes your house away?
I can't wait around for anotherAmy.
I ain't got time.
JOHN:
Okay, Max. This time you win.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- Hi there.
- Ariel, uh...
If you're not going to keep
our date tonight...
...I'm bringing the date to you.
- Huh?
You promised that you would come over
and give me the New Deal lecture...
- and like a good student...
- Uh, what's that?
It's a gift.
A snow angel.
You inspired it.
I can't accept it.
Why not?
I, uh... It doesn't... It...
Ariel, I think it might be a very good idea
if we didn't see each other.
I mean, for a while. Anyway.
You know, give each of us
a chance to be alone and...
But I thought...
Ah, goddamn it.
Look, Ariel, please.
- First place, I'm too old for you. Okay?
- What does that...?
Mainly, I don't like you coming over here
any time you feel like it.
I don't like you hanging around here
all day long, damn it.
Look, I'm not like you.
L... I'm not afraid to be alone.
I am not afraid to be alone.
I just prefer to experience things...
...and not just watch them on television
or looking out the windows like you do.
Don't you understand? I like being alone.
Oh, I understand.
I understand completely.
You don't know a damn thing about me.
I do too.
And I also know that the only things
in life that you regret...
...are the risks that you don't take.
Oh, but you wouldn't understand that.
Because you're too pig-headed.
[SOBBING]
Oh, damn.
JACOB:
Hi, John.
- John.
JOHN: Yeah?
- How are you doing?
- Hey, Jakey.
- Merry Christmas.
- Congratulations on the election.
Thanks. That's kind of
old news though, John. Where you been?
Ah, well, I had all of this stuff
that I had to get taken care of. I, uh...
Oh, hey, listen. Melanie said
that she's gonna come by tonight.
You, know, Christmas Eve. Around 9:00.
- Is that right?
- Yeah. So why don't you drop over later?
- Yeah. Well, I'll do that.
- Okay.

Hey, Pop.
Merry Christmas, John.
Ariel.
Hey, Gustafson,
your cat crapped on my steps again.
Yeah? Who says you can't train a cat?
Ah, yeah? Well, that's a warning.
Don't let it happen again
or I'll punch you in the nose.
- Pop.
MAX: He started it.
JOHN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey. Where's Santa's favorite little girl,
huh?
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- Merry...
Come on, sweetheart. Hi, John.
What, no twinkle lights?
Huh? Yeah, well, I, uh...
I forgot about them this year.
- Be polite.
- Yeah.
- Hey, John.
- Mike.
- Merry, uh...
- Christmas.
JOHN:
Yeah, Christmas.
Can I put Allie in your bed?
JOHN: Yeah, sure.
MIKE: Good night, baby.
MELANIE: Bedtime. Say good night
to Grandpa.
ALEXANDRA:
Good night, Grandpa.
So how you been?
Lousy. Thought you two
were getting a divorce.
MELANIE: Dad!
MIKE: Ha.
Uh, actually, it's only a separation.
I had to get some things worked out
for myself before we could work on us.
Did you get it worked out?
Uh... Uh, yeah.
You know, as far as I can tell.
Damn, that's great, Mike.
Maybe the rest of us
should just put our lives on hold...
...for the next two, three weeks while you
oil yourself up with enough booze...
...and bullshit that you can make
your mind up. Shall we do that? Huh?
Uh, heh.
You know...
...maybe I'll grab a beer.
Yeah, you grab a beer. It's in the fridge.
What had gotten into you?
JOHN: I don't know.
Grab me one too.
Dad, try and understand.
He showed up last night.
Says he's gotten himself straightened out.
What do I know? I'm 68-year-old man.
I got no house, no wife, no pension.
What are you talking about?
Look, I don't know one damn thing,
but I know this:
The only things in this life that you
really regret are the risks you didn't take.
And, God, Mel, if you
see a chance to be happy...
...you grab it with both hands and
to hell with the consequences.
Okay?
Okay.
Uh, Dad?
I'll be damned if I can find a bottle opener.
Sweetheart, I'm gonna walk down
to Slippery's.
What?
MELANIE:
Dad...
Oh, hey, Jakey. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
[MELANIE SIGHS]
Uh, is this a bad time?
I'm sorry, Jacob.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
He just exploded.
Do you want me to go after him?
No, no. That's okay.
He'll cool off down at Slippery's.
Come on in.
What's that?
Oh, this is, uh, broccoli.
Pop didn't have mistletoe, so I...
[BOTH LAUGH]
Mike! Hey! You're next, big guy.
- Heh. Hi, Stinky.
- Ha.
I, uh... I just came by
to wish you all a Merry Christmas.
Oh, that was sweet, Jacob.
Wasn't that sweet, Mike?
Yeah. Sweet and short.
- Well, I...
- Ha, ha.
JACOB: Uh...
- Ha, ha.
Uh, good to see you, Mike.
Uh, Jacob?
JACOB: Yeah?
- Could I ask you a favor?
JACOB: Sure.
Could you have a word with your dad?
See if they can't make up for Christmas.
Uh, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
MELANIE:
That would be great.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Over at the Gustafsons'?
- Yeah.
- Melanie there?
- Uh-huh.
[MAX CHUCKLES]
She, uh... She look good?
Very. She also looks to still be married.
What? Mike's back?
Looks that way.
You know, Melanie said that
John just exploded and walked out.
- So?
- So, what's going on?
Nothing that shouldn't
have happened years ago.
Pop...
He tried to steal her away from me,
but I won.
Could you at least, uh, talk to him?
My door is open.
He knows where to find me.
He started it.
I don't care who started it,
you're gonna end it.
I don't like him. I never liked him.
You know, it's Christmas, Pop,
all right?
At least you could go down to Slippery's
and make peace with the man.
I'd rather kiss a dead moose's butt.
[MOOSE GROANS]
This 1 ,500-pound moose
is the real thing, folks.

Peter Carlson, of Wabasha...
...who found it injured on a hunting trip,
brought it home, and brought it up...
MAX:
Merry Christmas.
Moron.
Putz.
Thank you, Lou.
Jacob says that Michael and Melanie
are, uh, gonna get back together again.
Well, Jacob doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.
Melanie is getting a divorce.
Ah. Yeah, well, uh...
...I got a couple of things I want to tell you.
- Yeah?
The reason I came down here tonight is...
...I wanted to tell you...
Spit it out. I haven't got all night.
- Don't shout.
- I'm not shouting.
Bust my tuchus to get down here
on Christmas Eve to thank you...
...and all you can do is shout at me.
- Wait.
To thank me?
All right, I take it back. I don't thank you.
Oh, for... Jesus, it's impossible.
Impossible.
Look, Goldman...
I want to ask you something.
Well, what? I ain't got all night, either.
I'm just as busy as you are.
Listen, do you love her?
Do I love her? What the hell
does that have to do with anything?
It would make
the whole thing worthwhile.
You know something, Gustafson?
Sometimes I think you've lost
whatever frigging marbles you ever had.
What do you think you did,
walk on coals for me?
Gave me back my old fishing pole
and I told you, "thank you."
- Fishing pole?
- Yes.
- Pisses me off you had to break it first.
- Oh, my God.
- But schmuck that you are...
- Ha, ha. Aah!
...I suppose I gotta be realistic.
What the hell is so funny?
You are so butt-blind, you think this
whole thing is about a stupid fishing pole?
- What's it about then?
- Forget it.
What do you mean forget it?
Don't give me that crap.
- I wanna know.
- You really wanna know?
Yes, yes!
Ariel.
What about her?
You made me feel sorry for you.
She chose me. She did.
And if anybody says otherwise
they're damn liars.
JOHN: What's the difference?
You got her anyway.
- Heh.
- What the hell are you looking at?
Stupid moron.
Complete idiot. Ah.

Emergency. We need an ambulance.
Somebody dial 911 .
MAX:
Miss?
Miss, could you tell... Could you...?
Oh, nurse. Nurse?
Nurse?
Could you tell me
where Mr. John Gustafson is?
Are you friend or family?
John Gus... What?
Are you friend or family, sir?
Uh...
Friend.
Merry Christmas, John.
You putz.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Well, you'd better have a good reason
for standing me up this morning.
What's wrong?
Can I come in?
Sure.
ARIEL:
Hi.
I know that you said
that you wanted to get rid of me...
...but isn't this a little drastic?
[SIGHS]
You know, my husband
passed away at Easter.
And if you leave me at Christmas...
...I won't have any kind of holidays
to look forward to.
Except for maybe Thanksgiving and...
You know, I really...
I'm not crazy about turkey.
So, what do you say?
Let's get out of here.
[SOFTLY]
All right.
[LAUGHS]
Okay, I can wait.
MAX: The guy could be dead tomorrow,
for chrissake.
I'm sorry your friend is sick,
Mr. Goldman...
...but the court order is in
and my hands are tied.
Check the bedroom.
I want all that paperwork filed.
Gustafson's straight as a grizzly's dick.
He'd never cheat on his taxes. Never.
It's not a matter of cheating.
It's a matter of, oh, miscalculation.
You friend received health benefits for
20 years while claiming as a married man.
Um, however, he omitted to inform us...
...that his ex-wife had a part-time job
for 11 of those 20 years.
Had he done so, we'd have informed him...
...that, because of her income...
...a larger portion of those benefits
were subject, of course, to federal tax.
Ooh, about $1 3,000.
Thirteen thousand? Well, he can raise that.
However, uh...
...that amount, when combined with...
...11 years worth of interest,
mandatory late charges, and penalties...
...uh, comes out at about
$57,000, ballpark.
He'd never find that.
He will when we sell his house.
Dirty rat. I'll show him.
Picking on people.
SNYDER:
Let's go, let's go. Hubba-hubba.
- Where's the Realtor?
MAN: Get the door?
SNYDER: Listen, men, all the furniture
goes to the auction house.
Any paperwork
put in the back of my car, okay?
MAN:
Yes, sir.
- Beautiful day, Mr. Goldman!
- Hey, Snyder.
Do the world a favor and pull your lip
over your head and swallow.
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]
SNYDER:
Asshole.
Bloodsuckers.
- Max, what's going on?
- Morning, Ariel.
Anyone looking?
No, why?
SYNDER: I don't care.
- We got a problem here, sir.
- What is it?
- Somebody's barricaded the doors.
Wait a minute.
What?!
- Well, break it in.
- Watch this. You'll get a kick out of this.
SNYDER:
We'll see about this.
Yo, Ray.
This isn't gonna stop me, Mr. Goldman.
I got him right where I want him.
[ICE CRACKING]
[CAR HORN HONKING]
No. Jacob.
Got it, Pop. Just like you said.
- You don't understand.
- No, no, it's good. I can handle it.
I'm Jacob Goldman, Mayor of Wabasha.
Jacob! No! Ha, ha.
I've got a 30-day cease and desist
order says you can't touch this house.
[WHISPERS]
Jacob.
Very well.
JACOB:
Whoa.
[ROOF CREAKING]
[SCREAMS]
[MAX LAUGHING]
[SNYDER GRUNTING]
But, you...
[BELLS TOLLING]
[ORGAN PLAYING SOFT MUSIC]
- Jacob?
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Wow, you look great.
- Thanks, so do you.
No, no, I mean it.
People always try to be nice
by saying you look great but, uh...
...you really do look great.
- I feel good.
- Yeah. So how are you?
I'm good, Jacob.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Yeah. Listen,
I'm, uh, sorry about the, uh...
- Divorce. Yeah, thanks.
- Right.
I mean, I'm just glad
it's over and done with.
Yeah. Yeah, you must be.
[MELANIE SIGHS]
- Ready for this?
- No, not really.
[WOMAN SOBBING]
Listen, Mel, if you need someone
to talk to tonight...
...I'm staying at Pop's.
Thanks, Jacob. I'd like that.
GRANDPA:
Hey, you two!
Get your asses in here!
- I guess it's time.
- Yeah.
[SOBBING]
[GUESTS CHATTERING]
- Where have you been?
- Relax, Pop. You nervous?
Not nervous. The groom is nervous.
- I'm not nervous, schmuck.
- Don't call me a schmuck, you putz.
Fellas, you're in a church.
[GUESTS CHATTERING]
[SIGHS]
[GUESTS CHEERING AND APPLAUDING]
Wait, wait!
Ain't you forgetting something?
Oh! Grandpa!
Okay, that'll do it.
Yeah. That'll do it, Dad!
I think that'll do it.
- Okay, here we go.
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, Max, you're the greatest.
MAX: Thank you.
Thank you.
- I love you.
JOHN: Goodbye, pumpkin.
- Bye, Jacob.
- Have fun.
Hey, Gustafson. Here's a house.
Jacob got them to waive
the penalties and interest...
...and I took care of the 1 3 grand.
Wipe the smile off your face,
because it's just a loan.
And I'll lay 8-to-5 you can't get it up
the entire honeymoon.
Oh! You're on.
I got a sure winner.
[ALL CHATTERING]
JOHN:
You smell something?
[JOHN SNIFFS]
What is that?
- That dirty son of a...
- Ugh.
[JOHN MUTTERING]
[TIRES SCREECH]
[LAUGHING]
What a putz.
[LAUGHING]
What do you feel like tonight, Pop,
Leno or Letterman?
Tell me about it in the morning, Jacob.
Oh. Where are you going?
The Daughters of the American Revolution
are having a little dance at the VFW.
Maybe I'll get lucky. Don't wait up for me.
[MAX HUMMING]
[DOOR CLOSES]
MELANIE: Hi, Jacob.
JACOB: Hey, Mel.
- What you got there?
MELANIE: Broccoli.
JACOB: Holy moly.
MELANIE: Ha, ha.
MAN:
Marker.
He's in. He's in.
Looks like he's gonna enter
the holy of holies.
- Huh?
- Coitus uninterruptus.
LEMMON: I throw back
what I'm not gonna eat.
Oh, yeah, like that 40-pound muskie
you're always yakking about.
It's a shame that... That, um...
Your uncle has a fish market
on 23rd Street and 14th Avenue.
- And, uh...
LEMMON: 26th. 26th Street, you dummy.
- Ah, you schmuck.
MAN: Marker.
Yeah. It looks like Chuck's
slipping her the old salami.
- Oh, Jesus, Dad!
- Ha, ha!
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
I'm Ronald Reagan. I used to be
President of the United States.
- I live across the street over there.
- Yes. Yes, come in.
MATTHAU: I was also in the movies
for a while. I was a lousy actor.
Looks like Chuck's gonna
put the hot dog in the bun.
- Oh, Jesus, Dad.
- Oh.
- That's why I came down.
- Yeah, well, spit it out.
- Don't shout.
- I'm not shouting.
Bust my tuchus to get here
on New Year's Eve...
...or Christmas,
or whatever the **** it is.
CREW: Ha-ha-ha!
- And, uh...
Looks like Chuck's a tomcat on the prowl.
[MEOWS]
I got a pinched sciatica that would make
your lumbago look like eye strain.
Pain. He... Is it...? Does he?
Would he? Is he...
- Yes, he is.
- Is he...?
Looks like Chuck is taking
the old log to the beaver.
Looks like Chuck's gonna bury his boner.
Yeah, that's right, you're a moron.
If you hadn't had Amy...
[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]
[BOTH SPEAKING GIBBERISH]
It looks like Chuck is taking
the skinboat to tuna town.
Looks like Chuck is taking a ride
on the wild bologna pony.
[TIRES SCREECH]
Who left?
[ALL LAUGHING]
If I knew there was a nude scene
in this picture...
...I would've asked
for another million.
MAN:
Slate it.
