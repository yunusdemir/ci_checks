The Beauty Inside








I have to hurry.
I can't let other people to see my face.
Why is it have to be this way?
Woo Jin-shi
My yesterday's face was only as big as my hand.
Today's face...
It's twice bigger than yesterday's face.
But, it isn't all that bad.
This face is only for today.
It'll be another different face for tomorrow
A man...
A woman...
An old man...
A child...
Even a foreigner's face...
It'll be a different face, after I wake up every morning
My eyesight is good sometimes, but it's terrible some other times
My voice is the same, too. It's different each day.
Good morning
I Have to prepare everything for my new self
every morning
Why is it turn out to be this way?
How can I return as I was before?
I have no idea
I am a furniture designer
I design it myself
I produce it myself
Nothing's special
Nowadays, when everything
can be searched by internet
Different face each day to live,
might be safer this way
He's my friend, the only one who can recognised me...
He's Han Seon Bak
Is it Woo Jin?
A furniture designer,
who can craft any kind of furniture
Yet, he can't personally picks out
even a handle nor gets out of home.
Feels like going crazy
Hey, crazy guy!
It's not like we're going to craft an England's royalty
table that has centuries of history.
ALX designer, Kim Woo Jin Seonsaeng-nim.
I get it, I'm going to finish it soon.
It's all right to take it easy today.
Let's go have a party.
with me,
we'll go out to a night club!
Do you come here often?
Only a few times with some friends.
I have a friend.
Whom appearance changes,
everytime he wakes up in the morning.
What's your name?
Kim Woo Jin.
Kim Woo Jin.
Kim Woo Jin.
Kim Woo Jin.
Kim Woo Jin.
He can change into an old man, a granny,
a male, even a female each morning.
I'm telling the truth.
What's your job?
What do you do for a living?
A civil servant.
A dentist.
A comedian.
Can you imagine dating such a person,
who's different each day?
It's impossible for such a person to exist.
I'm not lying!
he's my friend.
Excuse me, I'm going to the toilet.
I'm going to the toilet for a while.
You can leave your coat here.
It looks painful.
Would you like to go?
Although, yesterday I had such vigor
Today, it's even hard
to see something.

Even if my heart is moved,
it's only for a day.
Having to live a life,
with different face each day.
That's it for today.
That's it for today.
That's it for today.
That's it for today.
That's it for today.
It all started that day,
eleven years ago.

It was my eighteenth birthday.
Who's this Ajussi?
Is it really my reflection?
Is it a dream?
Welcome!
Mom!
How?
Why is this happening to me?
What do I have to do?
My mother didn't take me to the hospital.
Instead, she took me back home.
She cried... and said sorry to me.
I stopped going to school.
A normal life slowly gone further away
from me ever since.
Can I help you, miss?
Sorry, I'll come back another time.
My friends went to university.
When they started dating and love someone...
I can't see it yet.
How's is it that way?
Then, I realized
That there's no going back anymore.
Each day, I have to live with various faces.
By the time I'm able to adapt to it...
Good morning, Eomoni!
This person came over.
Is Woo Jin at home? No?
He's never at home.
Please give this to Woo Jin.
I've added lots of Odaeng.
[Odaeng - flat fish meatballs]
It has been so long since I last seen you,
looks like you've gained some weight.
What is it, that you eat all this time?
He's my childhood friend
Seon Baek...
Ddeokbokki  have to be eaten together with bokbunjaju.
[Bokbunjaju - a wine made of raspberries]
Eomoni sometimes unaware that the bottles
are empty when you drink.
Because of that, it went to soju...
Sorry, because it was soju...
Eomoni...
Who are you?
So, Ajumma, you're  Woo Jin?
After you wakes up every morning...
Ajumma, are you really Woo Jin?
I'd like to ask you something.
Where would we like to go?
Which store was it? The one by the junction?
Ddeokbokkie store.
S.E.S.?
Eugene.
Starcraft?
Zerg.
How could I do it as Zerg?
Drones.
Oh god, I'm going crazy.
Who's my favourite Japanese actress?
Sora Aoi.
Sora Aoi!
Ajumma, how would an old woman knows Sora Aoi?

Hey
emm ?
And then...
We started to laugh.
Today you wake up as an an Ajumma?
Why don't you go on a reunion?
Why are you here?
I too, started to laugh.
I feel like I'm going crazy
Today is like this?
I know that you're Kim Woo Jin.
What do you mean?
That you're my friend, buddy.
A friend for fifteen years.
It's been nice and lucky
to have you as a friend.
I couldn't be happier.
Don't be ridiculous.
So, we've been friends for years.
In these fifteen years, we've been through together a lot.
Thus, beacuse of this such a close friendship of ours.
Let's start a relationship. Do it once with me.
Are you crazy? Never.
Of course I'm not crazy.
Can't we do it just once.
Ever since I was born, I've never
met a woman like you before.
Besides, if you can't accept it,
you've mistaken.
If a friend make a mistake, you have to say it as is.
It isn't wrong, is it?
Snap out of it, this is Kim Woo Jin.
And I'm Han Seon Baek.
Then..
I wasn't serious,
It was only a joke, punk.
If we can't do it,
at least let me have a look, just a little.
Hold on, my eye...
My eye...
Get lost! Go away!
Are you Kim Woo Jin?
Yes.
You've come?
I can't believe it.
I'm planning to quit.
Why?
This is really horrible,
look at this.
The company where I work copies your creation, identical.
Look at it yourself.
Such an animal!
Copies other's work, and sell it off.
What an animal.
So, it better to look for a way
that others can not copy.
Wooden furniture.
Wo-od cookie?
Each person has different
ways of sitting.
Some are sitting normally, to the middle,
some are sitting on the sideways.
The furniture's design is then adjusted
to customer's body figure.
What do you think?
Seon Baek wants to create a fusion of
several brands altogether into one.
Wood funiture.
Hey, how could you have such an idea?
We've already have a name, ALX.
I can't possibly think of this idea by myself.
Let's do it together!
You're on design, and I'm on sales.
Isn't it great?
Sounds interesting.
Han Sajang!
[Sajang - President of a company]
Welcome, sir.
Furniture and housewares are combined.
What do you think?
Once you pressed the button on the table,
a hidden drawer will come forward.
If we turn over the table,
a computer that's linked to a monitor
is then directly in front of you.
Total transformation.
I'm who designs, and you sell it.
We should work on our own field.
Of course, who else but you
can think of such details.
Also, the armrest's angle.
The splice's so smooth, too.
Your flatteries hurt my heart.
I know it'd be like this. Sure, I'll produce it right.
Please, order cheaper materials.
What do we have?
Ah right, an armrest.
Oh, that day was just...
It'd better if it's cheaper
than that day's armrest, Sajangnim.
Jigwon-nim, as the Sajang-nim,
I give you all my trust.
[Jigwon - employee]
So, you are a writer.
When you're writing a book,
are you crossing your legs while you're sitting?
This one...
It's legs are quite long.
This chair isn't suitable.
Our legs's length is related to a chair,
I don't even know that.
Perhaps, you have other design that you like?
A chair that is confortable sit on,
even when you sit for a very long time.
A chair with an armrest.
The wood used for this chair is unique.
It was from an old ship, which was unused.
Just like magic, isn't it?
It started as a tree, was then built as a ship,
and finally turned as a chair now.
Do you have any specific design in mind?
When I'm working,
my sitting style is quite unusual.
How should I explain this...
Like a man who's riding a horse.
Shorter than the table,
but higher than the chairs.
Is there such a model?
May I guess what your occupation is?
You craft furniture, don't you?
Am I right?
Actually, I saw you
when you were picking out armrests.
Have you heard of ALX?
If you order from them,
it might took a while.
But, their designs and materials used
are very good.
This is their website.
You can purchase any from here.
Is it really all right?
(If he'd purchase it from ALX)
Of course not.
This is a place I've often visit.
Yet, why is it that only you
who hasn't realised?
It's durable even when used by family members.
Can be used with families for a long time
Mainly made of teakwood
Although teakwood is relatively  heavy,
but it's durable.
You may try to sit on it.
Every day,
I always go there to meet her.
Do you usually spends quite a long time
Excuse me, is it usually took longer
for you to have dinner?
Do you often changes sitting position?
Have you gone to Myanmar?
This table is made from Myanmar's woods
If so, I highly recommend this chair for you.
However my appearance would be,
she's so consistent somehow.
This is my card.
You may contact me whenever you have any enquiries...
But...
To her, the me who always meets her
is her first time to see.
Should I tell her how I feel?
Such foolishness.
To say love today,
but tomorrow I'd be a different person.
But...
Thoughts and feelings aren't always in line.
A good-looking face is far better
than bad-looking face.
Young is better than old.
If so,
Tall and handsome,
How are you?
Today, finally...
...it happened.
Although, however our appearance could be,
the inside is what's more important.
A good first impression can provide an opportunity to begin in socializing.
Are you looking for something?
Can I help you?
Can I help you?
Is it all right for those for sale items
to be in for the exhibition?
There'll be new items coming
in two days, anyway.
Today, I've come with determination.
These are enough, I think.
All right, please come again some other time.
Oh, right...
Which is better, this chair,
or the one you mentioned earlier?
Which is better, wooden one, or steel one?
Which one would you like, steak or chobab?
[Chobab - sushi rice covered up in tofu wrapping]
Pardon?
Chobab.
Oh, then, get in, please.
I too, like to eat chobab.
Unfortunately, today...
I don't have much time at the moment,
because I have to tidy up the warehouse...
But, this can only be done today.
Anyway, it's almost dinner time,
aren't you hungry?
I appreciate your kindness.
Enjoy the food.
Ho--hold on, please wait!
Truth is..
I've practised a lot
before I came here.
I just wanted to have a dinner with you.
Why is it have to be today?
The food isn't bought from there?
No.
Excuse me, I have to go home now.
There's a better place than here, actually.
010 2191 1331.
Seoul, Nonhyeon-dong #27-12.
If I turned out to be a bad person, just in case.
Which I'm not. I assure you that I'm not a weirdo.
Please, you can confirm it yourself. The number.
I'm sure when we get there,
you'll love it, Yi Soo.
Isn't this ALX's workshop?
Our siljang-nim really like this place.
She really wanted to buy products from here,
so I sent many emails of purchase.
But, there's no reply.
Is Miss Yi Soo doesn't like it?
Why? Of course I do.
For someone's furniture,
It's so cool,
Although, this is quite expensive.
Oh it's...
...it is necessarily so.
Isn't it?
Are you an employee here?
Yeah, you can say that.
Please, have a seat.
May I sit here, really?
Of course not.
It's been a long time since I eaten some chobab.
So delicious
May I borrow that?
Pardon?
This one.
Are you sure we can eat this here?
Yes, it's all right.
It's like the sound come out of
a tape if it's like this.
Not bad at all.
The sound's really like it's come out of the table.
Like, press something, or open something's somewhere.
A secret compartment would
come out of the table.
As the Transformer does?
But, it'd be so weird, wouldn't it?
I still feel so full right now.
A little too far to walk on foot, I think. Is it all right?
Should be better to get on a car, if I had known this.
All right.
Right there.
Gangnamjip.
My house.
Just contact, or text me later, okay?
Ok.
I'm home
Ah, it's you.
Have you eaten?
I have... Delicious one.
Is it a guy? Looks like there's something.
I'm here all night today.
If I'm not asleep, my face wouldn't change.
Why have I never thought of this before?
Luckily, I hought of it now.
I won't sleep ever!
I'll never sleep from now on.
What would we do now?
Do you like music?
Are you a regular customer here?
Please, have a seat.

The trees are awesome.
A guitar's melody...
Can be turned out this way.
Ramirez...
A Jose Ramirez...
The guitarist's name.
Do you recognise this song?
Yes, I do.
I'm a bit surprised
hearing this song
What is it, why?
Well..
I'm feeling there's something we have in common,
Woo Jin.
But...
You'd come again to this place?
Let's eat.
But...
Why didn't you tie it up before you eat,
intead of tying it up when you're eating?
It's the exact time I'd enjoy the meal.
Speaking of which, what do you
do here, exactly?
Something like designing, I'm a designer.
You? A designer here?
That guy, what's with him. And look at this mess.
How are you today?
I really miss you.
Isn't this prepared for
a couple of lover, actually?
It could be amazing at night.
Not this way.
No! Stop it!
He should've clean it up after he finished his meal.
He knows I'd eat it
while dipping it into the sauce, doesn't he?
He knows I'd enjoy it, doesn't he?
So tasty.
Oh that's...
So, it's this one, isn't it?
Why do you keep calling me?
Someone's going to sleep, you a$@%# !
Do you have anything interesting
to tell me?
Just go home and sleep, b#@$@ !!
Sorry, to have you wait so long.
Oh, not really.
No, it's not.
Only two hours, I think.
Right.
This place?
I sometimes come here.
It's very relaxing to be here.
Is it a ring?
How pretty.
You looked like someone
whom hasn't sleep for several days.
Looks like you could faint anytime.
How was your sleep last night?
Not bad, I think.
Are you sure?
Of course, I'm very healthy.
I mean, tomorrow...
Tomorrow is my mother's death anniversary,
I have to get home earlier.

Would you have breakfast with me tomorrow?
Fall asleep yet?
Not yet, why?
Why, what is it?
Take this.
Because you're dongsaeng, I give you that.
What's this?
What?
Female... Female c..condom
You idiot. You thoughtless girl.
Ah it's..
It's not like that.
Why are you embarassed if it isn't like that, then?
It's really not.
Your heart must've be beating real fast now, isn't it?
There's something ticklish, right?
If you sleep with him like that...
Is it over?
Something's like that could happen, you know!
Ah, it's impossible.
Who says it wouldn't?
Depends on the person too, though.
It really is magical.
He really like someone
that I've known for long.
It's so comfortable.
Already asleep?
He's a good man, is how I feel.
Sir, excuse me.
Sir, please wake up. We've already arrived at the last station.
Doesn't matter when,
wants to be always together.
It's nothing but a mere illusion.
Although we've promised to see each other,
And Yi Soo is waiting for me.
It's all over, there's no going back.
Yesterday...
Yes, Siljang-nim?
Yi Soo, the interns are
going to come today, aren't they?
Next week.
Right now the ones who come
are volunteers.
I'm just worried that I might forget
so I want to confirm it first.
Don't you know what time it is?
Why haven't you come to work?
Sorry, I overslept. / You overslept?
I'll quickly come over there.
Awesome! Come quick!
Yes.
It's over with this, isn't it?
Yi Soo!
Still waiting for me in the morning...
I truly don't want everything
to disappear like this.
I'll do anything for her.
From what I've observed,
I have a conclusion.
A good-looking person,
with a good work performance.
Whom living his days seriously.
Beautiful.
How pretty.
Not bad at all
Yi Soo.
Teach these interns well.
yes
Study hard,
and in three months, you'll be full-time employees.
Excellent.
Where did you learn this?
Books.
My name's Han Jae Kyeong.
It's nice to meet you,
Han Chae Kyeong.
From now on, let's work together.
Oh sure, but.. um..
It's nothing.. I'm glad to meet you too.
First day of work is hard, isn't it?
No, not really.
You're Jae Kyeong, aren't you?
Yes.
Um, if you don't mind.. dinner...
Seonbae-nim!
Excuse me.
We'll talk later, Jae Kyeong.
What is it?
Gather around.
Get ready to go home, everyone.
Today, you've been working hard.
I wish that, everyday
I can see your smile.
Thank you for today
Everyone's been working hard
Thank you for today
Um, do you have any appointment after this?
Are you hungry? If you don't mind,
would you like to have dinner with me?
Jae Kyeong, Is there something you wanted to tell me?
Do you remember someone named Kim Woo Jin?
This is the first time someone else
comes here.
Do you remember anything?
What's all this?
All of it is in your house
Yi Soo...
Listen carefully with what I'm going to say, okay.
Who are you, actually Jae Kyeong?
Do I look weird in your eyes?
Are you a stalker?
No.
- Yi Soo..
- I'll leave now, excuse me.
I am Kim Woo Jin!
I'm not Han Chae Kyung
I'm Kim Woo Jin
This might sounds really weird to you
Take a look at this
Hong Yi Soo, a place
I've been gone to many times.
Today's the first time to meet her face to face
Hearing her voice and
looking into her eyes.

The chair that is made from
a ship's woods or something...
Our ideas are almost identical.
That's enough for today
Actually, this is
the first time I feel this way.
Just sitting here without any sleep at all,
you can call it a miracle.
Although, I'm deeply concerned about what's going to happen.
But, for now I don't even care.
That's enough for today.
All of them are...
...me
After I wake up each morning, my face change
So, even though I changed into whoever it may be,
I'm still Kim Woo Jin
what are you talking about?
We're eating chobab while we talked about chairs...
Listening a song together inside the workshop...
We went to the antiques store...
Ramirez...
What I'm about to say might sound very weird
and little crazy,
But, I
Love you
I don't understand with
what you just said
What I'm saying is...
the truth. All of it is true.
Why do you do this to me?
I'll text you later-
We shouldn't
see each other anymore.
Her face when she heard what I just said...
...looked very familiar.
Started from the day my face was first changed.
Also, my reflection on the mirror.
Also, my mother who couldn't recognised me
anymore after my face changes.
Also, Sang Baek.
I become another person, again.
Come on, let's go, hurry!
What are you doing?
Eonni, is there someone
whose face can change after they awake, each morning?
Of course!
Look at those actresses.
Right after they finished a TV series shooting,
their face would change.
That they're getting fat, that their face is swollen..
Why is it that you and that guy hasn't been
in touch lately? Anything wrong?
Forget it, I'm not even sure what's happening.
Why? What is it?
Something must've happened!
I'm right, aren't I?
He's 'over' too soon, right?
It's not that
Actually, it's...
I don't even know it myself, too complicated
Ahh
You don't have to wait for me.
Why haven't you eaten?
We have to eat together.
We've been waiting for you.
It must've been tasty.
- There's even sancwiches.
They're tasty, aren't they?
I would love a chair like this.
Wah! Just listen to the music.
It's so soothing.
Excuse me.
I bought a chair from this place.
I'm now looking for a table
which can be matched together with the chair.
It's made of a cherry tree woods
and it's crimson coloured
Hm... I often make my own sketch about it.
So, I'd like for the table's size to be bigger.
Or, I want it wider to be exact.
Woo Jin?
Excuse me?
Sorry, it's the wrong person.
I'm looking for Woo Jin.
Would you like some tea?
What is it then,
what do you need?
Do you know Korean?
I can't speak it,
But, I can understand it.
Is it really...
...Woo jin?
Yes.
So, you love me?
Is that so?
Love
If so, let's sleep together.
I miss...
Woo Jin's face that would
change after he wakes up.
Since when is it...
...like this?
Since I was eighteen years old.
After that, every day.
Why...
Then...
Even until today...
I don't understand.
How old are you?
The ID number that you said back then,
was it real?
Twenty nine years old.
The ID number is real.
That means we're about the same age.
Don't need such formalities then.
So, you can't die?
That, I don't know about it either.
I don't know.
Is it not a good thing?
Ah, so you don't understand.
Sorry
It's really messed up.
There's no positive side to it?
The day when I'm handsome,
I can have a date.
Why...
...is it have to be me?
Everyday...
...I've used to live this way.
By becoming a different person each time.
Then, I met you.
Uncomfortable.
It's hard to control.
To see each other face, talked as
how a normal person would do.
But, I don't have any of those.
I rarely speak, because of that.
Although
What would tomorrow morning be,
would I still be all right.
Woo jin?
Together with a woman
you met today...
can meet her again tomorrow
or even next week,
is something very common for most people.
For me, it's a miracle.
Each day that I'm with Yi Soo
No matter how small the things we do,
Can make me happy.
Because there's Yi Soo
The place I want to visit...
...and things I want to do
they are getting even more of them.
Does it hurt, Woo Jin?
How about now?
Not bad
I don't understand what is written.
Can't you write Yi Soo with Hangeul?
And a little bigger.
Each day, feels like it's getting shorter.
Each day, I wish for these days
would last forever.
There won't be anymore myself only in photos.
The sight in the photos
is slowly changing.
Hello?
Oh my, today you're an ajussi.
How can anyone live in a place like this
Aigoo
What is it?
It's nothing,
Just want to look closer with today's Jin Woo
Is it close enough now?
Not really,
It's still unfamiliar for me seeing you, even if I see you everyday.
How is it that there's an unfamiliar feeling
even if I see you everyday?
I'm sorry.
But...
hmm
With which face is it
that you feel most unhappy?
Yi Soo.
Can you use banmal
when you're talking to me?
[Banmal - non-formal Korean]
Although,
Because of my changing looks,
Yi Soo would be a woman
who'll receive so many love in the world.
Delicious, you should try it.
You shouldn't use banmal
to older people, little boy.
I've told you don't use banmal.
Why can't I?
Still using banmal?
Should I stop?
Cheers!
Watch out for a second.
Cheers!
Why's this, really...
Age does matter, apparently.
I've drunk so quick today.
Kim Woo Jin
How much is it?
62,500 Won
Use this card, please.
W-what should I do?
This one? Yes.
So weird.
Is he your son?
Oh, he's my friend's son.
Together like this,
feels so warm...
...so happy.
I'm no longer
alone in this world.
What is it?
It's nothing. It's just...
You're always change.
I think, whether if I can recognise you without having to see you or not.
Your scent... the feels...
something like that.
I'll hold your hand like this.
I'll always able to recognise you.
Ta daa
You must've not eaten yet, have you?
I have!
I already have...
...coffee.
Wah, you're only drink coffee when you're alone.
It's very delicious, just like what my mother would make.
Isn't it? Just like food for you.
This is, you--
Just eat it!
It's made with love and compassion.
- You're only needed to deliver lunch?
- That's right, enjoy your meal.
Why do you keep using Jeondamal?
[Jeondamal - Formal Korean]
Today's a bit awkward, isn't it?
No, just a little...
Today, you must come.
It's terrible for the table to look empty.
You hadn't came in to class for a month.
Don't mind work of other peop--
He's too much.
You should understand him.
I have to wash the laundry today.
Tidy up my house.
And look after the company.
Would you like to go together.
Really?
Oppa really can't go to the club today.
There are many things to consider.
This could be a new thing at work.
Want some coffee?
Want some coffee?
No, thank you.
I've heard many things about you.
I heard that you a long haired and fair skin girl.
This design's concept is sea.
Well-suited with elders.
Can also have a beautiful sound coming out of the table.
After we've tried to work on it,
It turned out well.
What do you think?
How about we keep the current trademark,
but we add some new designs?
So more people would like ALX's products.
This would then creating a chance for us going forward.
New standards
Good idea.
Who're you?
Yi Soo did it.
I'll adapt the new trademark's prices.
This could be huge.
Please, have a seat.
What do you think?
It's comfortable.
Oh right,
I heard your studio will hold a party
and invite us as thanks.
But,
At times like this, we still have lots of work to do.
I can't believe it either.
Most important thing is I'm not swimming in fresh water.
Just join me to have some wine.
When?
What a nice furniture.
Excellent.
Ha...
It really isn't going as planned.
Should I go as is?
Right. I can totally go as Yi Soo's Halmeoni, why not.
Doesn't make any sense at all.
Don't be like this, please.
Please...
At least be a man...
Why are you alone?
Even our maknaes bring their partners.
You really doesn't have any?
Today's main point is to bring a partner.
Why?
I always see you with different men.
I'm just curious who'd stay the longest.
But, you... really doesn't have any boyfriend?
I do!
You'll be surprised later.
Forget it. You always have troubles with men.
Why won't you look for one here?
Which one do you like?
Have you been waiting for me?
Yes.
Hello.
Ah Ha Ha
Ha ha
Wow, ow
Nice to see you.
I'm Yi Soo's Siljangnim.
I'll be going, then.
Have fun.
Two hours ago, I'm a Halmeoni.
I'm telling the truth.
This man, his eyes so captivating.
It is...
We should better be looking for other spot to have a drink.
You guys are disgusting...
Awesome.
Why are you keep staring at him?
I think I'm going crazy.
This Oppa's so cool, isn't he?
So useless.
Everytime he wakes up in the morning, his face change.
It's Chinese sometimes, women on other times.
Used to be a very beautiful girl.
I was totally fooled.
Don't listen to him.
Believe this Oppa.
Look into my eyes, I really want to live with you.
What are you saying?
How could there be someone like that?
It's him, there.
We're talking about him.
It looks like Sang Baek's drunk.
I'm not drunk.
Well, since I'm drunk, might as well to say this.
I hate Yi Soo.
What?
Don't listen to a drunk man.
Oh right. You bought the massage chair?
That's why you gave your address?
You wanted to wait on the chair and Yi Soo...
No way!
Yi Soo...
Woo Jin's a really nice man, don't ever hurt him.
You're a nice girl too, but I'm a bit worried.
Sorry, I'm a little drunk.
I'm a little late.
I'm going to the toilet for a bit.
Look around if you're bored.
I'm leaving.
Let him play.
Would you marry me?
We can have many children.
I'll get money for our children.
What's this?
Ah, that!
That's it for today.
That's it for today.
That's it for today.
What's this?
Why are you looking at someone's phone?
What a weird person.
Why are you like this, Yi Soo?
What is?
Why are there so many men in photos with you?
This is my mother's store.
That's my mother.
From here, this way.
No. Give it a little space.
This side is this way.
It's loose now.
Try it again.
Put it around there, then this way...
Do it faster.
I'll teach you some other times.
Yes.
Welcome.
I heard Eomonie's often talked about Woo Jin.
Eomonie can't see his growth anymore.
Is it all right for you to have a relationship with Woo Jin?
It's must've been hard for you, Yi Soo.
I can't help much.
I just wish that your relationship's going well.
Cheers!
I saw that man on side of a car yesterday.
Is everything going well with your handsome boyfriend?
I've just once seen him that time.
Have anyone ever seen him?
Have you?
When you're on a nightshift?
I feel that too.
How long have you been together?
He came with Han Sajang from ALX, right?
Ah, right. He did.
Call and ask him to come over.
Right, Yi Soo.
Someone's calling.
It's him, right?
Yi Soo, ask him to come over.
Next time.
You don't want him to hang out with your Seonbae?
Where are you?
I'm outside.
I'm outside, too.
Where are you?
Try to look for me.
Find me.
Don't fool around, where are you?
Sorry, I was just teasing you.
It's happening again,
Why don't I think of Yi Soo's feelings?
Yi Soo, sorry. I was mistaken.
I didn't expect you to be so shocked.
Don't laugh, I need to calm myself.
So, what is it?
I want the first thing I see tomorrow is Kim Woo Jin.
To avoid any unnecessary troubles.
So, you want to sleep over?
I don't know.
All right...
Sorry. I've scared you.
Don't ever do that again.
Hello?
Why did you leave on your own?
I should've took you home.
I'm already home now.
What's with your voice?
Because I couldn't sleep,
I went home last night.
Is that so?
Hello? Hello?
Wake up!
Dad, look at how Yi Soo's sleep!
What's with you recently?
What's with you?
Recentlt, there's a crazy person in the neighborhood.
I thought it was you.
It was too late a night, wasn't it?
Sorry.
That aside, you should've call your mother sometimes.
She called me everyday.
Why hadn't you called me for that?
Am I the one who hadn't called you,
or are you the one who hadn't answer my calls?
Sorry.
Put this in the fridge.
Make sure to put it in the fridge.
Your mother said that many times.
Ah, my head.
Yi Soo and I did it.
Why don't you two just live together, then?
You think of that too, don't you?
I too, think of that.
What's with your mother
that her son is this stubborn?
True love can happen depends on how
you do it.
Marriage... I want to get married.
Right... I wouldn't hesitate anymore.
I'm ready.
I don't think today's good for it,
tomorrow would be better.
This chair is made from woods
with new technologies, which make it look more natural.
What woods is this made of?
oh
How about the size?
Seonbaenim.
Hello. This chair is...
Took some more medicine?
No.
Yi Soo, let's go to my room for a while.
Ok
Yi Soo, are you sick?
I've a bit of problem with my digestion.
I'm also getting lack of sleep recently.
Why can't you sleep?
It must've your boyfriend, isn't it?
You know,
There's a gossip that you're going out
with different men everyday.
Even Sajangnim's asking me about that, too.
However silly it is,
the gossip's spreading.
You're always looked healthy,
but lately you looked tired and even took medication.
Tell me.
I really am fine.
If something's happened, I'd tell you.
Please, tell your story.
I don't know how to begin.
I mean... the man I love... he's weird.
Everytime he wakes up, his face would change.
Into someone else.
Really strange, isn't it?
Seonsaengnim said that I can record it, didn't you?
I've been forgetful lately.
Of course.
I'm happy to be with you.
Don't have to think of anything else.
Even if there are some problems.
I want it to be always like this.
You, as how you looked right now.
And I'm here, looked like this.
Yi Soo.
Yes?
How if we get married?
Don't tease me. This wine is so good.
What a marriage is...
Are you upset?
No.
is not about my own feelings.
Could you pull the car over?
For a marriage, many things have to be considered.
Do you think about it, too?
How can we introduce ourselves
to our families?
This is also have to be considered.
Yi Soo.
I...
Each time we're together in the morning,
I think,
I want us to live together forever.
Why, you...
You're always thinking about yourself.
There's time to adapt to yout changes,
you know about it yourself.
You always look at the mirror every morning
to check on yourself.
I'd like that, too.
Even if we're getting closer,
it makes me think about it even deeper.
You also have to think about it.
What do I have to tell to my friends?
What about my family?
How would I introduce you to someone?
What Yi Soo said was right.
I'm even angrier to myself then.
I'm confident with the marriage even it's difficult.
But, you never thought of what if you were in my shoes
and only thought of marriage.
How can I trust and marry you?
This really is hard for me.
Can you give me more time?
Don't worry. You don't have to think about it anymore.
Look at me.
I think that we both have the same thought.
It's difficult to love someone
whose face change everyday.
Can you recognise each person you've met?
He's the one who'd always come after me.
Silently reach out to my hand.
I know it's him.
But, Seonsaengnim...
As I look at someone who holds my hand,
but I don't recognise him.
He smiled at me,
So I smiled at him.
I'd like to get to know him closer,
but a day's too short.
It might be because of a lot of stress.
When that person's touch me,
I keep thinking whether if it is really him?
I keep thinking about it.
That I'm unsure about it myself.
When I close my eyes and hug him,
my heart's feel so comfortable.
It's like I slowly turning into a weird person.
Do you want to end it?
I might not be able to go to work anymore
without that man.
If so, tell me the truth,
what is it that you want.
If you don't, only one that would survive.
A troubled heart, wouldn't last until the end.
My head hurts.
The patient lost consciousness
for taking too much medications.
Hold on.
Patient Hong's guardian.
When was the patient started taking the medication?
Yes, right.
I understand.
Patient Hong's guardian.
A psychiatrist will come, please have a seat.
What medication is this?
Risperidone.
Found inside the patient's bag.
[Antipsychotic drug]
You don't know about it?
For your lack of sleep,
I'll prescribe you some medication.
But, this isn't a solution.
It could keep getting worse.
Also, can you tell him
as soon as possible?
I don't understand why she didn't say anything.
For her to suffer like this.
All the while I was only thinking
something that should only be a dream.
As I recall that Yi Soo has never talked about it to me.
I really like her eyes
that say nothing.
Mom.
What is it?
To sit together like this, feels so relaxing.
With my child that I've rarely meet.
Do... you eat well?
yes
You looked like just like him.
It's irrefutable.
What do you mean?
My child... it's going to be all right.
You two have never met each other,
but I'm sure that you'll be all right.
What do you mean?
You're just like your father.
He'd also change into different person.
Although, for his love for you,
he hid his identity.
His voice was also sometimes changed into a man's or a woman's.
At first, he hid it.
Then, one day on a flower garden.
He left, and I've never find him anymore ever since.
The next day,
I could no longer remember his face.
Suddenly, there's something came to mind.
What could've happened to him, I would've never know.
That man disappeared.
I could never find him.
Ever since that day, my life's been so hard.
It was truly frightening.
That one day, only money and a letter
were left by your father. He had disappeared ever since.
It was... not what he would've wanted.
It all because of me.
I'm the reason your father disappeared.
Yi Soo too, would've find it difficult.
She failed to assure herself.
It's frightening.
Why hadn't you told me about this?
That my father's same as me.
A monster.
He just left like that,
I shouldn't follow him, then, by leaving?
You could survive until now,
you must've been through a lot.
Mom.
What about Yi Soo?

Can I continue my life
even if I lose Yi Soo?
I'm so happy to see Yi Soo's face everyday.
Yi Soo's never been bothered by my appearance.
I truly believe that two people can live
happily ever after.
Love can solve problems.
Yet, love can also destroys everything.
Thank you for today.
See you tomorrow.
I'm going home now.
Good bye.
Thank you for today.
You should've called me first.
I have an appointment with a friend today.
There's something I want to give you.
Is this have to be today?
Is this the "Couple Chair"?
Yes. I made this one just for you,
it's been so long that I'd wanted to give this for you.
Please, have a seat.
Do you like it?
I like it very much.
The snow's beautiful.
It's been so long since I've seen snow this beautiful.
Why is it not cold?
You'd like to walk down tonight like this?
Yi Soo...
Hmm?
What would be good to do tomorrow?
Let's just end this relationship.
Is something wrong?
I think it's better that way.
Don't ever take any other medication.
You'd better hurry home,
or you'd catch a cold.
Woo jin.
He was always here next to me.
But, he is not here anymore.
I don't know what to do.
My heart, please stays strong.
What's this?
Right.
It fits your size, doesn't it?
Does it, really?
Eonnie.
I remember...
That we went together to eat at a restaurant.
I remember everything.
But not his face.
What is this?
Lies of the past,
slowly returning back.
I can sleep well without any medication.
Continue my life.
Start working out again.
Reading newspaper and books sometimes.
Sometimes, I ask myself.
What is it that I did yesterday and would do tomorrow?
Everyday with the same face.
Everyday with different change of heart.
Maybe it isn't you who changes everyday.
Maybe, is it me?
It'd be good eaither in living room and bedroom.
There's also a chair available.
You can look around.
If you need anything, you may call me.
Okay.
Yi Soo, this is a picture uploaded on a blog.
What do you think?
It's really nice.
Isn't it?
But, why is someone with this talent
only works anonymously?
Let's look for him on the internet, shall we?
Who's the designer?
Is there any company we can contact to?
Have you sent the purchase request?
I'll call you later.
Ok
Sorry, it was an important call.
Where were we?
I'm here for business matter, Sang Baek.
So, you don't have to be awkward of this.
The product will be launched on a week.
Thank you, we'll be prepared.
You may contact us by phone.
Can't you send other person next time?
How's Woo Jin doing now? Is he all right?
Czech.
He went so far.
I'm home.
Yes.
Dad.
What is it?
Don't you miss mom?
What are you talking about?
I said, don't you
miss mom, dad?
Of course I am.
Dad, if she were here,
What would you to do the most?
I wonder... Getting old together?
I've looked this old.
Yet, she was always looked as she was before.
Hi, Seonbae.
Hi, you've came so early.
At the time, what was it that I'm afraid at?
Other people's gaze towards us?
Or, the mess and pain
that I have to go through when I'm with you?
All of it isn't even compare to the pain
you're feeling.
Seonbae-nim?
What a beautiful music.
Hello, who is it? Is it Woo Jin?
Could you leave somewhere?
What is it? I'm busy with work now.
How can I...
What are you saying?
I can't hear you.
I'd just hang up, okay.
What are you saying?
What language is this?
Had you been drinking?
Hey, call me later after
you've returned to Korean, okay?
I'll hang up, then!
Do you need something?
Hi!
I'm here to see...
...Kim Woo Jin.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
There's no one here
by that name.
I thought he stayed here.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Sorry.
Wait!
This is this Lea Furniture, right?
Do you mind if I go inside
and take a look around your furniture?
I'm a buyer from Mama Studio in Korea.
It's a big furniture store.
Would you like some... tea?
Do you work alone?
Yes.
My company is interested in your work.
I came across your design in Korea and I was...
so drawn by it.
I could just email you.
But, I want to see you and talk to you.
And here I am.
Woo Jin...
I'm all right now.
You're still hurting, right?
But, it feels worse without you,
than the pain itself.
I'm so sorry, Woo Jin.
Can't we just be together
without having to worry about anything?
Yi Soo...
I've think about it,
I want to be with you.
Someone who's taciturn as you,
whom couldn't express what's on his mind well...
...how could you ever lived by yourself?
I've seen how your looks changed.
Once when I was still awake after you slept
and witnessed it.
Honestly, I was a little afraid at the time.
Although, I know that once I saw it
by myself, I'd still feel afraid,
But, as time goes on,
I should've thankful for that.
Because it's a day that I
met the real Kim Woo Jin.
It doesn't matter however your appearance might change.
Even if the day after it would change, I have no problem with it.\
Beause I'll still love you.
The one I love is the Kim Woo Jin's inside.
Sorry, for this has been delayed for too long.
Woo Jin, would you like to marry me?
I'm not sure,
There are many things to consider,
not only a thing or two.
Also, who's the one that said she needed more time?
Hurry up, if you agree to it!
Don't want to?
Let's try it again once more.
You'll try to propose once more.
Stand right there!
Stand right there and repeat!







At first, there were a bit of fear and anger.
What would happen if the baby
I had in me, would then turned out to be like you?
It'd be really hard to accept it.
That's why I can never show myself up in front of you.
I can only protect you from afar.
Because, you're the only one who knows.
I know...
Sometimes, I can feel your presence.
Now, I'm not afraid of the pain anymore.
There's something else I'm afraid of.
I'm afraid if you've gone far away,
what if something happened to you?
I'm even more afraid if we can
no longer with each other.
And doesn't love each other.
Can't you stay with me forever?
