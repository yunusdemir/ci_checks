Previously on Teen Wolf...
So that puts Matt at the
scene of three murders.
We know it's Matt.
Just do what he says.
What, are you gonna
kill everyone in here?
It's what Jackson's for.
Your mother wrote this note.
I don't know how I can sit till
someone paid for her death.
What Peter managed to do
doesn't come without a price.
He's going to come
at you, Derek.
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.
I've done everything
that you've asked of me.
Help your friends.
Leave Matt and Jackson to me.
You know when you're
drowning, you don't actually
inhale until right
before you black out.
It's called voluntary apnea.
It's like no matter how
much you're freaking out,
the instinct to not let any
water in is so strong that
you won't open your mouth until
you feel like your head's
exploding.
But then when you finally do let
it in, that's when it stops
hurting.
It's not scary anymore.
It's actually kind of peaceful.
Are you saying you hope Matt
felt some peace in his last
moments?
I don't feel sorry for him.
Can you feel sorry for the
nine-year-old Matt who drowned?
Just because a bunch of
dumbasses dragged him into
a pool when he couldn't swim
doesn't really give him the
right to go off killing
them one by one.
And by the way, my dad told me
that they found a bunch of
pictures of Allison
on Matt's computer.
And not just of her though.
I mean, he photoshopped
himself into these pictures.
Stuff like them holding
hands and kissing.
You know, like he had built
this whole fake relationship.
So yeah, maybe drowning when he
was nine years old was what
sent him off the rails, but the
dude was definitely riding the
crazy train.
One positive thing
came out of this, though.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah, but I still feel like there's
something wrong between us.
I don't know.
It's just like tension
when we talk.
Same thing with Scott.
Have you talked to
him since that night?
No, not really.
I mean, he's got his own
problems to deal with though.
Mom.
Mom, we're gonna have to
talk about this eventually.
Okay.
I'm going.
I love you.
I don't think he's
talked to Allison either.
But that might be more
her choice, you know.
Her mom dying hit
her pretty hard.
But I guess it brought
her and her dad closer.
Jackson?
Jackson hasn't really
been himself lately.
Actually the funny thing is, as
of right now, Lydia is the one
who seems the most normal.
And what about you, Stiles?
Feeling some anxiety about that
championship game tomorrow night?
Why would you ask me that?
Ah.
Uh, no.
I-I never actually play.
But hey, since one of my
teammates is dead and another
one's missing, who knows, right?
You mean, Isaac.
One of the three runaways.
You haven't heard from
any of them, have you?
How come you're not
taking any notes on this?
I do my notes
after the session.
Your memory's that good?
How about we
get back to you?
Stiles?
I'm fine.
Yeah, aside from the not
sleeping, the jumpiness,
the constant, overwhelming,
crushing fear that something
terrible's about to happen.
It's called hypervigilance,
the persistent feeling of being
under threat.
But it's not just
a feeling, though.
It's... it's like it's
a panic attack.
You know, like I
can't even breathe.
Like you're drowning?
Yeah.
So if you're drowning, and
you're trying to keep your mouth
closed until that very last
moment, what if you choose to
not open your mouth?
To not let the water in?
Well, you do anyway.
It's a reflex.
But if you hold off until
that reflex kicks in, you have
more time, right?
Not much time.
But more time to fight
your way to the surface?
I guess.
More time to be rescued?
More time to be
in agonizing pain.
And did you forget about the
part where you feel like your
head's exploding?
If it's about survival,
isn't a little agony worth it?
And what if it
just gets worse?
What if it's agony now and then...
and it's just hell later on?
-  Then think about something-
"If you're going through
hell, keep going."
As you can see, Scott,
there's been some interesting
developments lately.
I think we should catch up.

<font color="#ec14bd">www.Addic7ed.Com</font>
Come on, Scott, let's be
realistic about who's got
the upper hand here.
Let her go.
Can't do that.
But let her live?
That's up to you.
What do you want?
I want to talk.
You haven't been
answering your phone.
Let her go, and we can
talk about whatever you want.
I want the same thing
that I have always wanted.
I want Derek and his pack.
You have them all in hiding.
How am I supposed to
know where they are?
I think with the proper
motivation, you could draw them out.
And if you hadn't noticed, I now
have a fairly impressive means
by which I can motivate people.
Why do you think I'm
able to control him?
Oh, you know the myth, Scott.
The kanima is a
weapon of vengeance.
This is about Kate?
I didn't just come
here to bury my daughter.
I came to avenge her.
Are you okay?
I don't know
what's happening.
I don't know what that thing
was or even what you are, but
whatever he wants,
just give it to him.
Mom, it's not that easy.
Do what he wants.
Just give him what he wants.
I don't know if I can.
Derek told us to
be back before sunup.
I thought I heard something.
Look, if we're gonna do
that whole "I thought I heard
something" thing, then we
shouldn't be stopping.
We should be running.
No, listen.
Coyote?
Wolf?
No, it can't be.
There are no wolves
in California.
No, but there
are werewolves.
That didn't
sound like Derek.
Maybe it was...
You decided.
When?
Tonight.
Everyone's gonna
be at the game.
And we figured it
was the best time.
It's not like we want to.
What do you want?
Since I just turned 16
a month ago, I wouldn't
mind getting my license.
I can't do that if
I'm dead, you know.
Well, I told you
there was a price.
You didn't say it
would be like this.
Yeah, but I told
you how to survive.
You do it as a pack.
And you're not a pack
without an Alpha.
We know.
You wanna look
for another pack?
How are you even
gonna find one?
We think we already did.
Would you mind
seeing who that is?
It's okay, Isaac.
We're open.
Like all of a sudden we
heard all this howling.
It was unbelievable.
There must have
been a dozen of them.
Maybe more.
Yeah, or maybe only two.
You know what the
beau geste effect is?
If they modulate their howls
with a rapid shift in tone,
2 wolves can sound like 20.
Look that doesn't
matter, okay?
There's another pack out there.
There's got to be.
We've made up our minds.
We lost, Derek.
And it's over.
We're leaving.
No.
No, you're running.
And once you start,
you don't stop.
You'll always be running.
I expected a slightly
warmer welcome.
But point taken.
Why does it smell like that?
What?
Scott said almost the same
thing to me a few months ago.
One day he could somehow tell
the difference between which
animals were getting
better and which were not.
He's not getting
better, is he?
Like cancer.
Osteosarcoma.
It has a very distinct
scent, doesn't it?
Come here.
I know you're well aware of what
your new abilities can do for you.
Improved strength,
speed, and healing.
You ever wonder what it
could do for others?
Give me your hand.
Go on.
What did I do?
You took some
of his pain away.
Only a little bit.
But sometimes a little can
make quite a difference.
It's okay.
First time he showed
me, I cried too.
It's quite a situation you've
got yourself in here, Derek.
I mean, I'm out of commission
for a few weeks and suddenly
there's lizard people, geriatric
psychopaths, and you're cooking
up werewolves out of every
self-esteem-deprived adolescent in town.
What do you want?
Well, I want to help.
You're my nephew.
One relative that I have left.
You know, there's still a
lot that I can teach you.
Can we just talk?
Sure.
Let's talk.
They're leaving
tonight, during the game.
So, why are you telling me?
I'm not telling you.
I'm asking you.
I'm asking for your advice.
From me?
Why?
Because I trust you.
Why?
Because you always seem to
want to do the right thing.
I usually have no
idea what I'm doing.
Actually I always have
no idea what I'm doing.
Hmm.
Do you want to let me know
what you're doing right now?
I'm not going anywhere
if that's what you mean.
I have too many people
here who need me.
Well, I guess that makes me lucky
'cause... 'cause I don't have anyone, so.
Are you gonna go with them?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I will.
Good luck with the game.
Well, thanks, but I'm
not... I'm not going either.
Can't even think about playing
some meaningless game right now.
You weren't at practice
last week, were you?
No, I skipped it.
Why?
And you didn't hear?
Hear what?
Jackson was there.
What do you mean "there"?
Like, he was...  like
nothing had happened.
Really?
That means... the game tonight?
Yeah.
He's playing.
Whoo!
Yeah, go cyclones!
You okay, dude?
I'm perfect.
Well, we all know
that, but are you okay?
You didn't answer
my texts all week.
I'm getting worried about you.
Jackson.
Jackson!
Wow, good to go.
Stay in the goal
tonight, Danny.
Do not come out.
And if you see me coming towards you,
run the other way as fast as you can.
"Good morning.
In less than an hour, aircraft
from here will be joining
others from around the world.
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind."
What?
"Mankind... that word should have
new meaning for all of us today."
What the hell is
he talking about?
He does this every year.
Seriously?
Yeah.
"We are fighting for
our right to live."
Yeah!
Wait, is this?
Yeah, it's the speech
from independence day.
"But as the day the world
declared in one voice..."
Coach's favorite movie.
"We will not go
quietly into the night!"
Does he know any
sport speeches?
I don't think he cares.
"Today we celebrate
our independence day!"
Yeah!
Let's do this!
Well spoken, coach.
I might have chosen something
with a little more historical
value, but there's no
denying your passion.
And while I haven't been here
long, there's no denying my
pride in having a winning
team for this school.
I know you'll all be brilliant
tonight, even with only one
co-captain leading you.
Now, I'm your principal,
but I'm also a fan.
So don't think I'll be content
to watch you merely beat this
team.
Get out there and murder them.
You heard the man.
Asses on the field!
Yeah!
Coach, are you benching me?
It's not my decision.
But I have to play.
McCall, you're
failing three classes.
Academics come first.
Coach, you don't get it.
You have to let me play.
McCall, no.
Not tonight.
Tonight, you're on the bench.
You don't actu... actually think
that I want to be the Alpha
again, do you?
That wasn't my finest
performance, considering
it ended in my death.
I mean, I'm usually
more... okay, go ahead!
Come on, do it.
Hit me, hit me.
I can see that it's
cathartic for you.
You're letting go of all the
anger, self-loathing, and hatred
that comes with total
and complete failure.
I may be the one taking the
beating, Derek, but you've
already been beaten.
So, go ahead.
Hit me if it would
make you feel better.
After all, I did say
that I wanted to help.
You can't help me.
Your dad coming?
Yeah, he's already here.
You seen Allison?
No, you seen Lydia?
Not yet.
You know what's going on?
Not yet.
It's going to
be bad, isn't it?
I mean, like people screaming,
running for their lives,
blood, killing,
maiming kind of bad?
Looks like it.
Scott, the other night seeing
my dad get hit over the head by.
Matt, you know, while I'm just
lying there and I can't even
move, it just... I want
to help, you know,
but I can't do the things
that you could do.
I can't...  It's okay.
We're losing, dude.
The hell are you
talking about?
Game hasn't even started.
Now put on your helmet
and get out there.
You're in for Greenberg.
What?
What happened to Greenberg?
What happened to Greenberg?
He sucks.
You suck slightly less.
I'm playing?
On the field?
With the team?
Yes, unless you'd
rather play with yourself.
I already did
that today, twice.
Get the hell out there!
Ah.
Oh, no.
Why is my son running
out to the field?
Because he's on the team?
He is.
Mm-hmm.
He's on the team.
He's... he's on the field.
My son is on the field!
Oh, dear God.
Can you hear me?
Ah, you can.
Good.
Then listen closely because the
game is about to get interesting.
Play it again.
Let's put a real clock
on this game, Scott.
I'll give you until
the last 30 seconds.
When that scoreboard clock
begins counting down from 30,
if you haven't given me Derek, then
Jackson is gonna kill someone.
So tell me, Scott, who's
gonna die tonight?
Should it be your mother, who so
bravely came out to support you?
Or the sheriff, your
best friend's father?
Or how about the pretty little
redhead who managed to survive
the bite of an Alpha?
Or maybe one of these innocent teenagers
with their whole life ahead of them?
Oh, God.
Or should I do everyone a favor
and kill that ridiculous coach?
It's up to you, Scott.
But you are going to
help me take Derek down.
Because if you don't... I'll have
Jackson rip someone's head off right
in the middle of the field and
drench everyone you love
and care about in blood.
See?
Prime example right here.
I'm not healing as fast.
Coming back from the dead
isn't easy, you know.
I'm not as strong
as I used to be.
I need a pack.
An Alpha like you.
I need you as much
as you need me.
Why would I want help
from a total psycho?
First of all, I'm
not a total psycho.
And by the way, you're the one
that slashed my throat wide open.
But we're all works
in progress, right?
So, we need each other.
Sometimes when you need help, you
turn to people you'd never expect.
He's probably
just warming up.
Ooh, I got it, I
got it, I got it.
I got it, I got it.
Oh, he's just a
little nervous.
Plenty of time to
turn it around.
Ow.
Sit down, McCall.
But, coach, we're
dying out there.
Oh, I'm aware of that.
Now sit.
You came to help.
I came to win.
Come on!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Come on!
Allison, wait.
No!
No, no, run.
Go.
Go!
You got a plan yet?
No, right now it's pretty much just
keep Jackson from killing anyone.
Well, that might be easier
if you're actually in the game.
We have to make it so coach has
no choice but to play you.
How do we do that?
He's got a bench full of guys he can use
before he ever puts me on the field.
Can you do it without putting
anyone in the hospital?
I can try.
Lahey!
Ramirez!
You're in.
Murphy.
You're in.
Lahey!
Seriously, what the
hell is your problem?
Stop.
It's not broken.
But I can't move it.
I think Jackson nicked me
'cause I can feel it spreading.
You want to
play chess, Scott?
Then you better be willing
to sacrifice your own pawns.
One, two, three.
McCall.
Either you're in or we forfeit.
Hey, something's
happening, isn't it?
Something more than
a lacrosse game?
You should go.
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.
And everything that I
said before, forget it.
All of it.
Okay?
If you can do something
to help, then you do it.
You have to.
I will.
Stop!
Please, Allison, stop.
Don't you know what you're
really bargaining for, Scott?
Haven't you guessed what the
real offer on the table is?
It's Allison.
It's always been Allison.
You give me Derek, and
I'll let you have Allison.
You owe me a new bow.
You owe me an explanation.
For what?
I caught them.
Me.
"Caught" came
very close to kill.
And that's not the
way we do this.
Maybe it's not
the way you do it.
I think my way worked
out pretty well.
Allison...  hey,
grandpa, it's me.
We got our two runaways.
Call us back.
What?
It's just the first time
I've heard you call him that.
It was a good effort, Isaac.
It was.
This would be so much more
poetic if it were halftime.
You tried to build your pack.
You tried to prepare
for the worst.
You weren't ready.
Because of it,
Gerard is winning.
He's taking his time.
He's toying with Scott.
He's going after your
wolves, one by one.
He's relishing in his victory.
How about you tell me
something I don't know?
Oh, I'm going to.
And it's gonna prove why
you should trust me.
Why you need to trust me.
Because I'm going to tell
you how to stop Jackson.
What do you mean?
Know how to kill him?
Actually, how to save him.
McCall!
Where's McCall?
Where is it?
Where's the ball?
Where's the ball?
Where did it go?
Oh, oh, oh.
Ah!
Oh, crap.
Stilinski!
Shoot it.
Shoot the ball!
Shoot it, you idiot!
Shoot it!
Yay!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo!
I scored a goal?
I scored a goal!
I scored a goal!
Where is he?
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Whoo!
There's a myth that you can
cure a werewolf simply by
calling out its Christian name.
It's just a myth.
Well, sometimes myths and
legends bear a hint of truth.
Our name is a symbol
of who we are.
But the kanima has no identity.
That's why it doesn't
seek a pack.
It seeks a master.
And who else grows
up with no pack?
No identity?
An orphan.
Like Jackson.
And right now, his identity is
disappearing beneath the reptilian skin.
You need to bring him back.
How?
Through his heart.
How else?
You know, in case you hadn't
noticed, Jackson doesn't really
have too much of a
heart to begin with.
Not true.
He'd never admit it, but
there is one person.
One young lady with whom
Jackson shared a real bond.
One person who could reach him.
Who could save him.
Lydia.
Yeah!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo!
Your best ally has always
been anger, Derek, but what
you lack most is a heart.
That's why you've always known that
you need Scott more than anyone.
And even somebody as burned and
dead on the inside as me knows
better than to underestimate the simple
yet undeniable power of human love.
We did it.
We won!
Yes.
Yeah!
Nothing happened.
Nothing.
Scott!
Scott, where are you?
Scott!
Mom, mom, mom, mom.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
But somebody is hurt.
Somebody is down on the field.
Get out of the way.
Move.
Back off!
Move.
Jackson?
What's happened to Jackson?
Jackson!
Jackson!
Jackson, what's happening?
Can we get a
medic over here?
We're gonna need a medic!
He's not breathing.
No pulse.
Nothing?
Nothing.
Oh...  Oh, my God.
There's blood.
There's blood.
Look.
He did it to himself.
Get down here.
Get down here and
hold his head.
Tilt it up.
Stiles.
Where's Stiles?
Where... where's my son?
Where's Stiles?
Where's Stiles?
Where's Stiles?
Where the hell is my son?

Next on Teen Wolf...
My father wouldn't let
a rabid dog live.
Of course not.
Anything that dangerous, that
uncontrolled...  Allison!
Is better off dead.
Aah!
Kill them all!
