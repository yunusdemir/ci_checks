The truth is I was never
totally comfortable with a man.
Did you have any specific problem
with Dr. Rosenthal?
No, no. He just died.
His son took over the practice,
which is weird
because my little sister
dated him in school.
I think it's a good rule of thumb
never be older than your gynecologist.
Did you have any medical problems
in the history I should know about?
No, not really.
I eat pretty well,
I don't smoke or drink.
Basically the only substances I abuse
are hair care products.
-And your cycles are regular?
-Absolutely. Like clockwork.
-Are you sexually active?
-No. I mean, of course I am.
But not currently. I'd say
I'm experiencing a dry spell.
-So you're married.
-No. Not yet.
-I got engaged last year.
-That's exciting.
We were at the marina,
we were watching the sunset
and l popped that question.
Listen, Gwyn,
I was thinking maybe
you would marry me.
What?
I wanna marry you.
I think it's time.
It's been two years.
Yes, but…
You just bring this on me?
That's traditionally
how it's done.
Well, I know, but…
That's why
you brought me out here.
How long have you been
planning this?
I don't know.
Since we met.
That's not true cause
you were still seeing Cathy when we met.
But I was strangely attracted to you.
I remember thinking:
"This is a woman I could marry
if she wasn't living with my oldest friend".
<i>Right. Derek.</i>
<i>That didn't last long.</i>
It's my fault.
I just can't commit to anything in my life.
Why do you assume it is you?
Maybe I have a fear of commitment.
Maybe I have
the Peter Pan syndrome.
You can't be a Peter Pan.
Only men are Peter Pans.
Most of the great Peter Pans
in history were played by women.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you seeing somebody else too?
<i>I don't know why I was always</i>
<i>attracted to men like that.</i>
<i>Maybe my childhood</i>
<i>wasn't dramatic enough.</i>
<i>That's why I took you camping.</i>
<i>It's time you went out with</i>
<i>a nice guy for once.</i>
Sure that this is legal,
mosquito hunting without a license?
Can't you just relax
and enjoy the moment?
No, I'm a middle child.
I believe that really good moments
can happen to someone else.
It's a beautiful night in the Everglades.
My dad would have loved it here.
You and your dad,
you guys are close?
Yes, after my mom died…
-How come he never remarried?
-I don't know. He never got over it.
He's pretty much a
one-life-one-love kind of guy.
What about you?
Are you the same way?
-Got it.
-Thanks.
<i>I think that was the night</i>
<i>you fell in love with me.</i>
<i>You get so quiet sometimes.</i>
<i>It's probably hereditary. My grandmother</i>
<i>gets quiet too. Of course she's had a stroke.</i>
Hi, Grandma!
You ready to go?
-I'm gonna take her to the bathroom first.
-I can do that.
Lillian, You've got a choice
of nurses here: Gwyn or me.
-Grandma…
-Lillian?
You are so immature.
You always do that. cheap thrill.
I'm taking her.
We'll be back in a minute.
<i>Watching you with her,</i>
<i>I think that's when I realized</i>
<i>I wanted to spend</i>
<i>the rest of my life with you.</i>
You suddenly got
so sincere.
You know I get sincere
when I'm nervous.
But why are you so nervous?
My answer is yes.
I will marry you.
I love you.
I know.
-Is that a ring?
-No. Well, sort of.
I know you didn't want
a diamond ring.
-It's so traditional.
-Yeah. So I got you a napkin ring.
-A napkin ring?
-It was my mother's.
It was carved in Africa.
What do you think?
Just one napkin ring,
not the whole set?
A wedding represents the permanent
bonding of two lives.
It's a profound ceremony
and also a very personal one.
It is therefore that the wedding vows reflect
the colorful personalities of our bride and groom.
To that end Leslie and Jeff have chosen
to write their own wedding vows
and I will share them
with you now.
Do you, Jeff,
take Leslie as your wife
to have and to hold her
forever and ever?
Will you love Leslie in the dark,
and will you love her in the park,
and will you love her on a train,
and will you love her in the rain,
and will you love her here and there,
and will you love and keep Leslie everywhere?
I will.
Do you, Leslie,
take Jeff as your husband,
to have and to hold him
forever and ever?
Will you love him in a boat
and will you love him on a float?
You look very fashion, sir.
Thank you, Milady.
Where were you?
I was trying to cheer up Aunt Rose.
She hates weddings.
She says she'd much rather be at a funeral.
She wouldn't find a funeral
more depressing?
She says at a funeral
you know the suffering is over.
Here you see this happy couple
and you know the troubles
haven't even started yet.
That's wine.
I thought it'd help me relax.
I have anxiety.
-She is your baby sister.
-Yeah, and she's married so fast.
And when did they meet, three months ago?
It takes me longer to buy a pair of shoes.
Thank you so much.
That was the greatest toast you made.
-I want you guys to be happy.
-I feel so giddy.
-It's all the dancing. It's like a drug.
-I'm totally high. So is Jeff.
-Who is he dancing with?
-His sister.
-She played for the Dolphins too?
-No, she's fireman.
How long will that last?
Do you think
the ceremony was immature?
I thought it was a nice balance,
It was child-like but not childish.
You hated it!
What's wrong with you?
You're coming down of your high?
Come on, Les,
I'll give you another fix.
I guess you're next.
This marriage hasn't even
been consummated yet.
I get impatient.
Don't you want a family?
Can you stop rushing us?
You can't have kids forever.
That's not entirely true.
I read last year a woman
gave birth to her own grandchildren.
Come on.
That's crazy.
No. I like it.
You have grandchildren,
you see them twice a year
and send them checks or holidays.
Gwyn, dance with me, please.
Jordan, you know I don't dance.
People always think I'm having a fit.
That's right.
Go and dance with your brother!
Even Grandma Lili is dancing
with Antonio.
When you have your stroke
you won't be able to say "no" either.
-Gwyn, that's not funny.
-Sorry.
Thank you sweetie,
it's very sweet of you.
-You should dance with your wife.
-I'd love to but I can't.
Terri doesn't dance when she's pregnant.
No since her second miscarriage.
What's wrong?
Didn't you just feed him?
He cries whenever he hears
the word "miscarriage".
Because he knows it could have been him.
He has survivor skilled.
-I think I'm better taking him.
-Can you check the messages, please?
Who is gonna call you?
Everyone you know is here.
I'm expecting a big
ficus tree shipment at the nursery.
Tonight?
How are you gonna know
if Terri has the phone?
-Mr. Phone.
-Another phone!
I'm gonna buy you one of these
for your birthday.
Call the accountant.
See if you can afford the wedding.
-Mom, will you dance with me?
-Thank you, Jordan. I'd love to.
I was beginning to think
I was the only one at this table
capable of having a good time.
Hey, dad.
What are you doing?
You're always such a big dancer.
Not tonight, honey.
I feel old.
That's ridiculous.
-I'm not a young man anymore.
-What are you talking about?
You still practice a lot,
play tennis all the time.
Taste in music died at 70s,
that's true.
I don't know, Gwyn.
What's wrong?
What is it?
I shouldn't say
anything to you.
What's going on?
You make me worry now.
I think your mother
is having an affair.
With who?
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
You're not sure,
you don't know, right?
No, I told you
it's just a hunch.
For a long time now… I thought
we were __ a bad stretch.
We have always had our problems.
But you always work
that stuff out.
Anybody is happy to be married,
it's you and Mom.
I've taken her for granted
for too long.
Yeah, but still.
I can't imagine them. Mom…
Are you going to confront her?
No, I have no real evidence.
How could I confront her?
It's easy.
-Get a very hot lamp and leather.
-You are not taking this seriously.
I am, I'm sorry.
I just can't imagine mom
having sex with another man.
I still shudder when I think
of mom having sex with you.
Thank you.
I feel sick.
You don't even know
if it's true.
What if it is,
what if they get a divorce?
Is there a custody battle?
Do I become a latch key kid?
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would your mother ever have an affair?
He said he took her
too much for granted.
Do we ever do that?
Do we take each other for granted?
-Of course not.
-Not even a little?
A little. Sure, it's natural.
We're creatures of habit.
Ritual behavior gives us
a sense of security.
Would you ever
get bored with me?
No! And even if I did
I certainly wouldn't tell you.
I'd keep it to myself
and take a mistress.
I'm being serious here.
I don't want us to get too comfortable.
If you feel that nervous about it
then maybe we shouldn't get married at all.
That's not
an acceptable option.
We gotta make plans
one of these days.
Your parents keep asking me
when are we getting married.
I'm gonna strangle them.
We've been engaged for 3 weeks.
What's the urgency?
So we can hurry up
and have affairs like my mother?
Don't be so cynical.
Why do you always assume
the worst about people?
Statistics.
I have more faith. I bet your father
is imagining the whole thing.
Yes, maybe you're right.
Can you see my mother meeting some guy
in one of those cheesy motel rooms
with the mismatched curtains
and the AstroTurf carpeting?
She wouldn't know what to do first:
have sex or redecorate..
Terri wants to redo the baby's room.
What do you think? Turquoise or sea-green?
I wouldn't note the difference?
Which uniforms you like better,
Marlins or Dolphins?
Dolphins.
All right, I feel stupid.
Are you happy?
-Nina.
-What is it? I'm tired.
I…
Have you noticed that Jordan and Terri
don't seem as close as they used to be?
I know. Terri mentioned
they've been having some problems.
At least Leslie and Jeff
looked ery happy tonight.
Right now they're probably
humping like rabbits.
I certainly hope somebody's humping.
-Am I glad I'm married to you.
-You are?
-You are great.
-So are you.
-I didn't make too much noise?
-No, I love all that screaming.
-It makes me feel like Michael Bolton.
-Should I be more lady-like?
Believe me. It's great.
-Where are you going?
-I want something from the mini-bar.
That stuff's expensive.
Wouldn't you like to get a glass of water?
I don't want a glass of water.
I want a Coke.
Look, we have peanuts!
-They charge eight dollars a box.
-So I'll only have a few.
-How much are they?
-You want me to look the price list?
-There could be something cheaper.
-What is cheaper than peanuts?
All right, then just
have whatever you want. I guess.
Thanks.
Wouldn't Matt look great in this?
Mom, stop it now!
You have the subtlety of a woodpecker.
I just try to understand
why you're not planning the wedding.
Matt seems so wonderful.
He is a wonderful guy.
I love him very much.
What's wrong with him?
It is not natural to wait like this.
There's nothing wrong with him.
What's wrong with you and dad?
Nothing.
Then why does he think
you're having an affair?
He said that?
He thinks I'm having an affair?
He said he has a hunch.
I have to admit I'm stunned.
-I told him he was crazy.
-I mean, that your father could be so perceptive.
It's true?
I'm seeing someone.
-Who?
-You know him. Antonio.
Antonio?
Grandmother Lil's nurse?
Are you serious?
A nurse? Not even a doctor?
He's not
what you think at all.
He is very bright.
He is very articulate.
He came over in a boat lift.
He was in jail in Cuba.
I don't know what for,
he wouldn't tell me.
You're involved with him?
Is it serious?
I don't know,
It's only been a few weeks.
I'm not gonna leave your father
if that's what you're worried about.
You can't because
he would be devastated.
Don't be so naive. Your father
has been unfaithful plenty of times.
-Really?
-I'm sorry but it's true. Yes.
In fact I think he's still sleeping
with his travel agent. Zelda somebody.
You couldn't get back at him
the old fashion
and just go crazy
with his credit card or something?
I was miserable. Maybe I needed
to do something extreme, radical.
-You did. My head is spinning.
-Me too, me too.
After a lifetime of marriage
to be in a relationship where I am in control.
To feel sexy again.
Maybe I should have done it years ago.
No, it's good you waited.
It's the perfect moment in medical history
to turn promiscuous.
You're upset. Somehow I thought
you'd be more understanding.
I try but it's a little disturbing
to learn that both of your parents
are committing adultery.
That's not the norm.
Not in my life.
I shouldn't
have told you.
Tell me more.
How did it start?
Do you really wanna know?
It's gonna be obsessing all night
so I wanna get the details right.
<i>I was at the home a few weeks ago</i>
<i>when Grandma Lil had one of her minor strokes.</i>
<i>Antonio was there,</i>
<i>it was his birthday.</i>
<i>Some friends were supposed</i>
<i>to take him to dinner</i>
<i>but he stayed</i>
<i>until grandma had stabilized.</i>
She's really fine now.
-Antonio, thank you.
-It's all right.
You should get to your party.
I think it's too late already.
No. Really?
Would you let me
take you to dinner?
Anywhere you like to go.
<i>I would have picked</i>
<i>the most expensive place I could find</i>
<i>but Antonio wanted to eat at</i>
<i>a little Cuban restaurant near his home.</i>
I know it sounds silly
but I wanted to be an actress.
-It doesn't sound silly.
-You don't think?
In the way you keep
your mother's spirits up.
-You are a very talented performer.
-No, I'm not.
I tried when I was really young
but I was a disaster.
Oh, come on.
I went on auditions
and I would freeze.
Because I think
I wanted it too much.
That's crazy.
How can anybody want something too much?
Cause you can just get so consumed
with longing and hope,
that you can't think straight.
Everything is a blur.
That's love!
How can you love too much?
People lose perspective
all the time.
And too much love
can be dangerous.
You have this backwards.
<i>We talked and talked</i>
<i>and then it got very late,</i>
<i>and I drank too much wine.</i>
-<i>So he got you drunk.</i>
-<i>I wasn't drunk</i>
<i>but I didn't feel comfortable</i>
<i>about driving home</i>
<i>so we walked to his place</i>
<i>to call a cab.</i>
Yes, but don't get lost.
All right. 10 minutes.
Ten minutes for the car.
I didn't realize
that you were a weightlifter.
I was crazy. I saw it one night on TV
and had to have it.
I am one of those consumers.
Is that how you do it?
Let me help you.
You have to be…
-Your legs…
-Easy as that.
-You never tried it?
-Lift weight?
I think that at certain age
you realize there's no reward
in making parts of your body
bigger than they already are.
You are not old.
No, just beyond improvement.
You know what?
You are very beautiful.
Thank you.
So are you.
-I'm sorry.
-What's so funny?
I just can't believe it.
Tell me. Go ahead.
I just don't know.
Are you supposed to kiss me
or what?
Yes. I think so.
Oh, good.
<i>Jeez, you make it sound so romantic.</i>
<i>It was. It was thrilling.</i>
<i>I wanted to tell Dad the truth</i>
<i>so he knew I could still feel like that.</i>
Good morning.
-Where's my vitamin E?
-What?
Vitamin E!
I told you I would pick it up
but you said you were going to the store.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
What are you trying to do, kill me?
<i>He gets angry because he's getting old.</i>
<i>He's so afraid of death.</i>
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>You must have fears.</i>
<i>My biggest fear was that I died</i>
<i>without making love to anyone but your father.</i>
<i>So you got that with Antonio.</i>
<i>One time, that was it.</i>
<i>No, we meet now several afternoons</i>
<i>a week at his place.</i>
<i>We tried going to a motel once</i>
<i>but I couldn't relax.</i>
<i>The room was summoning?? awful colors.</i>
I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I know that.
It wasn't your fault.
I don't know what came over me.
-I'm glad you told me.
-Are you? You are not disappointed?
No, it's just I'm confused.
You keep pushing me
to get married
and then you tell me
that your marriage was a failure.
No, it wasn't a failure.
Not at all.
We had great times together.
We raised three incredible children.
We travelled.
He's still the most charming man
I've ever met.
I just can't stand
to be with him right now.
What are you doing?
You promised Mom you'd stop smoking cigars.
I'm working on it.
Did she say anything to you?
-Who?
-Your mother.
You two went shopping the other day.
I thought you had asked her about the situation.
You think I can be manipulated
that easily?
You two are close and I thought
maybe she'd open up to you.
I don't think she's very happy
with you these days.
She won't
play tennis with me anymore.
Did she accuse me of having
an affair with my travel agent?
-Why?
-Because it's not true.
There was a flirtation with
Zelda but nothing happened.
I don't need to hear this!
I just want you to know
that I'm not perfect.
You kids tend
to put me up on a pedestal.
Don't worry. We lowered it
the year you voted for Bush.
I have to get back to work.
I have Marlin tickets for tomorrow.
It's an afternoon game.
I can't. I promised Terri and Jordan
that I would come to their house for branch.
-Charlie! How are you?
-I was just seeing Dennis.
-Do you know my daughter, Gwyn?
-You're the one in advertising, right?
You did that pizza bit where
little guys walk across the pizza
and then they get their feet
stuck in the cheese.
There is no money
in 30-second comedy.
Half-hour comedy.
You've got to write half-hours.
-You wanna write a script for my show.
-I did.
-Send it to me.
-I did.
Send it again. This time
you put a note in there and say
"You are a schmuck, Charlie
if you don't read my script".
-Thanks.
-Send it to me. I read it.
Get one from Cuba. These Jersey Cigars,
they're not making it.
Beautiful jacket, isn't it?
He is so real, warm and plastic.
He's like the prototype for a human being.
You've been talking about
getting out of advertising
and doing something more substantial.
And there's so much substance
in sitcoms, right?
I don't know why you get so insecure,
your script is hilarious.
Thank you.
Your support means a lot to me.
It's worthless in the real world,
but it is important for me.
Pick me up later.
You make me sick, Jordan!
I know what makes you sick.
-It's not me, it's hormonal.
-I'm tired of your lies!
I just want you out.
Go, Jordan!
-You need to talk to someone other than me.
-I'll be talking to my lawyer.
Make an appointment,
lie down on a couch, he'll take notes…
Come on in. We're just having
a little domestic crisis.
Get out of this house
or I'll call the police!
-Please, Gwyn is here!
-I don't give a shit.
What the hell is going on here?
Terri is just a little upset.
That's all. She'll be fine.
I will not be fine, you bastard.
Please, Gwyn is here.
We'll do it later.
-Maybe I should go.
-No, a little help, please.
-How do you take your coffee?
-Decaf. Or with lots of milk.
Coming right up.
Lots of milk.
-You stay the hell out of my kitchen.
-I'm just trying to get some coffee!
What did you do to her?
I'll tell you what he did to me.
He cheated on me with my best friend.
-Who's your best friend?
-He's still denying it.
She's so selfish
she doesn't even have a best friend.
Not anymore.
Not since you screwed her.
Okay, I screwed her.
Are you happy?
You are the lowest
human being on earth.
Here's your goddamned coffee!
Now get out, you asshole.
You ruined my life.
It was a mistake.
It was a huge mistake.
I never should have allowed
the cellular?? phone bills come to the house.
That's how she found out,
the phone bills?
She could see that I was making local calls
When I said I was out of town.
Jordan, she was pregnant.
She won't sleep with me.
I need sex. I need a lot of sex.
Did you have to have it with another person?
Who are you calling?
I just gonna check voice mail.
-That phone is gonna give you a tumor.
-I'd use a tumor right about now.
Are you going to stay
with your girlfriend?
I don't think her husband
would appreciate it.
-She's married too?
-Yeah. It's Brad's wife, Kaia.
You slept with your partner's wife?
You're like a nuclear menace!
Your warhead should be dismantled.
You and Terri had the perfect marriage.
What changed?
Terri changed.
Oh, Terri changed.
And you didn't change at all.
When I married her
she was this young ambitious lawyer,
and now she just turned
into this mother.
And that should turn you __ ?
How did it all start?
It just happened.
We were all together at dinner
one night, Brad, Kaia, Terri and me.
We're taking Tommy with us
on the boat tomorrow for the first time.
You should come along.
You'd have a lot of fun.
I have to work tomorrow.
in the morning on the beach.
-Tough life.
-You should come and have a look.
It's bloody hard work.
<i>That night Terri accused me</i>
<i>of flirting with Kaia.</i>
<i>She was very perceptive.</i>
I wasn't flirting!
Will you keep the voice down,
the baby is asleep.
"The baby's asleep,
we can't talk",
"The baby's asleep,
We can't have sex",
"The baby's asleep,
We can't go out".
What are you talking about?
We just went out.
That wasn't out.
That was dinner.
Out is out,
out is "not in by 21:30".
Grow up.
<i>The next day after lunch</i>
<i>I went down to the beach.</i>
-<i>So you were looking for trouble?</i>
-<i>Not at all. I was just curious.</i>
<i>Then something happened to me</i>
<i>that has never happened to me before.</i>
<i>When I came to</i>
<i>I was in Kaia's dressing room.</i>
You're beautiful.
You think so?
I don't know anymore.
You are.
You are definitely gorgeous.
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.
I have a pin in my mouth.
I'm sorry.
-<i>She smelled like rose petals.</i>
-<i>Okay, I get the idea.</i>
<i>Afterwards I told her how frustrated I was.</i>
<i>How Terri and I even stopped going to the movies</i>
<i>and how after the baby</i>
<i>Terri never let me touch her breast.</i>
For us too. Last night
just sits and watches talk shows.
-It's tragic, really.
-Yes, tragic.
<i>We started meeting every few days</i>
<i>at a hotel room down the beach.</i>
<i>The sex was incredible.</i>
<i>I'm talking world class.</i>
<i>But I never wanted my marriage to end.</i>
<i>I honestly thought I could have both.</i>
-I just feel bad for the kids.
-Kids will be fine.
Terri is an excellent mother.
She is an excellent mother,
she's a brilliant mind
and she's still very attractive.
What changed?
What did she do wrong?
She didn't do anything wrong.
We just want different things.
People evolve differently.
One day you wake up
and the woman in bed next you
is not the woman
you fell in love with.
It's inevitable.
When are you getting married?
I'm sorry.
It's too traumatic for me.
-You wanted to see the birth.
-I did, I really did.
I just didn't realize that
the mother was gonna be in such pain.
But it's perfectly natural!
It's always natural
for the female to be in agony.
I thought you wanted
to learn more about my work.
I'm sorry I can't listen
to that grunting.
You'll be grunting like that
too yourself.
-What are you talking about?
-You said you wanted to have kids soon.
Yes, before the ozone layer disappears,
but not right away.
We can't wait that long
if we want to have a big family.
Who said that I want a big family?
I want a big family.
We've discussed it.
-No, we haven't.
-Well, I meant to discuss it.
But you know it would be a problem.
We want different things.
My brother was right.
He was just rationalizing
the collapse of his own marriage.
He did a very persuasive job.
I've got to go back in.
I'll go buy the chimp family a gift.
Or a snack for later. __
It was a girl.
They are already selling these
at the souvenir stands.
You give her one of those silly names
you always give monkeys,
like Coco or Puff-Puff
or Lemba?
Actually they're having
a contest next week.
-What? We still fighting?
-don't know, you tell me.
All right, let's talk about it.
How many kids do you want?
Do you think pandering
is the way to regain my affection?
-Yes, I do.
-Really?
-Okay. I want two kids.
-Me too.
-And I want them both to be girls.
-Me too.
-I want them to look more like me.
-Me too.
And I don't want them to ever have
to go camping if they don't want to.
-What are you doing?
-I'm making love to you.
__ hot?
Hold on, I have to put my thing in.
It's so hard to be spontaneous.
Why can't you go on the pill?
-'Cause I don't wanna get cancer.
-Millions of women take the pill.
Millions of women don't like oral sex.
Do you want to have a referendum on all bedroom activities?
I just want to be intimate with you
without an appointment.
I love you.
I love everything about you.
I love your face,
your hair, your neck.
You're still gonna be interested
in this neck when I'm 70?
You won't have a neck
when you're 70.
But I'll still have
my girlie sensuality.
I certainly hope so.
Nobody called.
You scared me!
-You've been smoking cigars in here again?
-No. Where were you this late?
I told you. Marion wanted
to see the new Kenneth Branagh movie.
-You're so tired all the time.
-I'm getting old!
No, you're not getting old.
Cause if you're getting old,
I'm getting old
-and I'm not getting old. Am I?
-No, you look great.
Maybe you're just working too hard.
You should think about a vacation.
You're right.
Do you want to go to Venice?
-You always loved Venice.
-I love Florence, you love Venice.
I can't go away now.
I'm redoing Judy's living-room.
A couple of days in Venice.
We'll eat, we'll drink, we'll sleep late.
We never sleep late.
We're always leaping out of bed.
It does sound kind of tempting.
I'll call Zelda in the morning
for tickets.
I really…
I can't go away now.
-Are you coming upstairs?
-In a few minutes.
I'm gonna watch
the highlights on sportscenter.
Can we go to the lingerie store?
I want a teddy.
You're still wearing
that lacey, silky, girlie stuff?
I do it for Jeff. Really.
He thinks it's romantic.
So you two are doing good?
Are you happy?
Yeah, it's great.
This is the guy?
For eternity.
Your kids can
save and buy one headstone.
-No complaints in bed?
-He is a football player.
You were a hussy when you were single.
-Little I?
-Yes, small can.
I'm not saying Jeff is perfect.
He gets a little cheap sometimes.
But he is considerate and romantic.
We share everything.
This is the one I was thinking
of getting. What do you think?
Not too bad.
It's just still __ in the crotch area.
Will it look as good on me
as it did on the girl in the catalog?
She's a model. She probably has eating disorder
and breast that exploded __ .
Excuse me. Leslie?
-Mitchell Ruskin.
-Oh, my god!
I didn't recognize you,
You look so different.
I've lost hair
and I got a nose job.
Dr. Mendelsohn, right?
My friend Laurie has the same nose.
Gwyn, you know Mitchell.
We went out most the 11th grade.
I always liked your nose.
So did I but
then I went to dental school
and I found
it literally got in the way.
You're a dentist?
-I heard you got married.
-Yes, I am newly wed.
What are you doing in here?
I'm getting my hygienist
a birthday present.
-I was thinking about a robe.
-Robe is good.
Maybe she wants something
a little racier.
Are you sleeping with her?
He's a man actually, my hygienist.
He just has a thing for lingerie.
Robe is good.
It sounds like I spank him.
I just want
something silky to put on
so he's cozy and can have my way.
I'm kidding.
-How does that feel?
-Incredible. You have great hands.
You are the one
who has great hands.
No, you should be
a physical therapist.
Actually I was thinking
of doing some decorating.
Like your mom?
Gwyn says she wants someone who can fix
her place and I think I can.
-I think I really have good taste.
-Yes, you do.
-That's not what I meant.
-And you've got a soft butt.
That's because I'm not wearing pads
 __ to play.
And your shoulders are soft too.
What is this?
Is this something new?
You don't like it?
I just can't believe
you went shopping again.
It wasn't expensive
if that's what you mean.
Do you need it?
Can you take it back?
No, I can't take it back.
it has no __ .
You can't just keep buying stuff like this,
We can't afford it.
How can you say that?
You made over 200,000 dollars!
This year!
Maybe for a few more years.
Then what if I blow a knee
or I lose step?
Do you know what I do then?
I go to high school football
and I teach math
for 14,000 dollars a year.
Why are you yelling at me?
You don't even know any math.
You don't even think.
You just don't think.
-Where are you going?
-You got me all tense now.
I'm going to watch some game
and relax.
Excuse me.
Gwyn, what are you doing here?
Are you flying somewhere?
No, my fiancé is coming in from Mexico.
His flight is delayed.
There is a storm there.
I'm waiting for the same plane.
-I'm picking up my mother.
-I hear that's a specialty of yours.
Nina told me you were very upset.
Really? I think
that I've acted very supportive.
You haven't visited
your grandmother in a while.
I don't wanna make my mother
any more uncomfortable than she already is.
We try to be discreet around Lilian,
but I think she sees everything.
That's 'cause she can't blink.
Your grandmother
is an incredible strong woman.
You don't have to tell me
about my grandmother.
I love her
very much.
Why don't you go after her?
She is at least single.
You really think
I'm some kind of pervert, don't you?
No, I have always thought
you were a terrific guy.
I think you are very patient
and very generous.
Did you think I was gay?
People always assume that I'm gay.
It's occurred to me.
Because I am a nurse?
Even Nina questioned me.
My mother is very picky about choosing a lover.
God knows how many of mine she's rejected.
I know.
What do you mean?
My mother talks about me to you?
All the time. She is concerned
why you haven't planned your wedding.
Yes, she thinks you are being
very unfair to Matt.
She sacrificed her moral high ground
the first night at your apartment.
__ .
Are you hungry at all?
-I can go and find some coffee.
-No, I don't drink coffee.
I just think
it's gonna be a long night.
Maybe I could have
a cup of tea or something.
Unless you'd rather wait alone.
It'll be good, eating airport food
to have a nurse around.
I'm so relieved.
I was beginning to think
you'd never set a date.
Now we can start gossiping
about something else.
This is it.
This is for your keys.
My keys?
It's a huge table.
Your mail or loose change.
Some people might put flowers on it.
-Do you both like it?
-It's a very nice piece.
All right, so I'll take it home.
You can bring Matt
to look at it.
-Why does Matt have to see it?
-He may not like it.
Who cares?
I'm buying the table.
You're a couple now.
You're gonna be married in 3 months.
I can't make
any decisions on my own?
Gwyn, you are such an extremist.
You're probably not gonna take
his last name either.
Why should I take his name?
Why shouldn't he take my name?
It's perfectly normal
in a healthy relationship
to give up
some of your own identity.
I don't wanna do that
cause I don't have any extra.
Okay, Let's surprise Matt.
Don't forget to give me the keys
so I can drop the ones that come with it.
I'm gonna go up to the home
to visit Grandma this afternoon.
Do you wanna come with me?
Sure I wouldn't be
a third wheel?
Do you mean Antonio?
It's his day off, thank god.
-What happened?
-Nothing.
But I can't keep seeing him.
It's crazy.
The whole thing
got so intense so quickly.
He's just so passionate.
-I thought that's what you wanted.
-I must have been out of my mind.
I don't even find him
attractive anymore.
You just exaggerate
for my benefit.
I was just drawn
by the thrill of the forbidden.
He's got tattoos
in strange places.
They flap or fly
or something.
The truth is things are getting
better with your father.
They are?
He's really making an effort.
He even came to look at wallpapers
with me the other day.
And you know he's always been
so dismissive with my work.
I was starting to worry
about you two.
When I was a kid I thought that romance
was flowers and candy and moonlight walks.
Now all I want is someone to hold my hand
while I pick out lawn furniture.
They didn't go for it.
They thought it was too creative.
The customers get older.
They're afraid nobody would get it.
I thought the whole idea
was to go younger.
But without alienating
their core customers.
They want me to make it worse?
Just less __ .
Am I interrupting something?
No, we are just debating an oxymoron:
art and advertising.
You got a minute?
Talk to Peter.
And I need it tomorrow.
-I'm taking you off Seven Seas.
-But it's my account!
-It's the client.
-The client loves me.
They said I was charming.
They are uncomfortable with the fact
that you are a woman.
There a few days every month where
I'm not so comfortable with it either.
Did they actually said that?
They like your campaign.
They're just concerned you may not
be around long enough to execute it.
What? They know
something that I don't?
You're getting married.
You'll have kids soon.
They don't want to have to start over
with someone new when that time comes.
Where do people get ideas like this?
From reading Dickens?
Did you at least fight for me?
You can't expect me
to argue with the client.
What about you?
You have a wife and a family.
You and I both know
it's different for men.
So this is it.
I've hit the glass ceiling.
You don't really buy that
"glass ceiling" stuff, do you?
No, I get it for free
every morning just showing up.
-This is totally unfair.
-I know.
I've got to get out of here.
I can't work.
Maybe I should have just quit.
That would have gotten their attention.
People always think,
because I've got this big mouth,
that I'm tough. But I'm not.
I always run from conflicts.
I know, you too, Grandma.
That was a little different.
You were running from the Nazis.
I could never have survived
what you did.
I would have lasted maybe a month
without cable TV and a shower.
Cause I'm weak.
My whole generation.
We're weak
and timid and selfish.
Our biggest vows in life
are over work and money and sex.
We have no real wars to fight.
You escaped to America.
What am I gonna tell my grandchildren?
That I escaped to the suburbs?
But then I think
it can be a great life.
Kids, __ and cockades…
Feel free to interrupt
any time you disagree.
There you go, Lillian.
Nice and cold.
It's getting very warm out.
I should take her back up.
Are you ready to go up?
Should I take that?
I'm gonna get some lunch.
You wanna go?
Enough to go to the beach?
There is a Chinese restaurant there.
-Is it cheap?
-It's very cheap.
You always knew
you wanted to write?
No, I was very shy so
writing was easier than talking.
-I bet you were very popular.
-No, I was not.
I was __ high school.
I was like a hatrack with nipples.
You'll make a beautiful bride.
You shouldn't be nervous about the wedding.
I wish I could be
more impulsive like you.
Do you think I am impulsive?
My mother says
that you are passionate and intense.
She always says that because
I speak Spanish in bed.
Shit! Race you to the restaurant.
It's really pouring outside.
Table for two?
Do you have a ladies' room?
I have to wipe me.
-Are you alright?
-No.
-Do you need a doctor?
-No.
-Do you want more toilet paper?
-No.
Yes, actually.
That would be nice.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
This is what I deserve
for falling in love with a married man.
I thought that this time
it was gonna be different.
But they're all the same.
They all say they want to start over
but they don't.
Not really.
Not with me.
Is there anything I can do?
Yes, you can tell that bastard
sitting out there a long goodbye for me.
I never want to see him again.
Tell him Zelda sent you.
-Are you in love with her?
-With Zelda? Are you nuts?
-I'm in love with your mother.
-Really?
You have a very funny way
of showing it.
I know.
It's terrible what I did.
And it didn't even mean…
Listen to me, I sound like a schmuck.
-You're not a schmuck.
-I know a schmuck when I hear one.
I was an easy target.
I was lonely.
Your mother and I
were fighting all the time.
35 years of slugging it out.
I wanted to be with someone
who said yes once in a while.
Not to argue, not to judge,
not to always __ the past.
You said that it was just a flirtation.
What happened?
About a year ago I began using her
to arrange travel for the firm.
She was excellent.
<i>Always in upgrade,</i>
<i>always special treatment.</i>
You work so hard
you don't even stop to take your jacket off.
Why are you wearing wool this time of year?
You should be wearing linen.
-Linen wrinkles.
-Live a little!
-You probably never eat lunch.
-I eat lunch.
-<i>Did you know she had a crush on you?</i>
-<i>It was just lunch.</i>
-You were an usher?
-For the summer.
-I was a Rockette.
-That's impossible.
Could I do this
if I wasn't?
<i>That's why you liked her?</i>
<i>Cause she showed you some thigh?</i>
<i>She was fun.</i>
<i>We went to games together,</i>
<i>she made picnics,</i>
<i>we played tennis at Williams Island.</i>
My ankle!
-<i>Was it broken?</i>
-<i>Just sprained. I helped her home.</i>
On the good foot.
Sit down.
Do you want me to get you
some more ice?
I just want to soak
in the bath with you.
<i>She sounds like</i>
<i>such a delicate subtle woman.</i>
<i>At my age you sometimes</i>
<i>need a Volcano to light a match.</i>
<i>I admit those first few afternoons</i>
<i>at her place were wonderful.</i>
How are you?
<i>Then I started to learn the truth.</i>
-You're not limping anymore.
-No, it feels much better now.
<i>Turns out she hadn't really</i>
<i>twisted her ankle,</i>
<i>turns out she was</i>
<i>never a Rockette.</i>
<i>turns out the woman is a pathological liar,</i>
<i>A psychotic.</i>
<i>Couldn't you just break it off?</i>
<i>I wanted to but every time I tried to end it</i>
<i>she threatened to call your mother.</i>
I think that Nina like to know
what a great man she has.
What are you doing? Zelda!
Stop it!
Behave like a person!
<i>I was trapped.</i>
<i>I honestly thought about killing her.</i>
<i>How?</i>
<i>Never mind how.</i>
<i>The point is I was desperate.</i>
<i>Last week I was in the kitchen</i>
<i>going through the mail.</i>
Look at what Judy smuggled out for you
from London! Cuban cigars.
And furthermore…
-Thank you very much..
-You're welcome.
-I thought you hate it when I smoke.
-I also know how much you love it.
And there are few tiny pleasures in life
so I say "go ahead".
Thank you very much.
But I really am quitting.
-Sounds familiar.
-No more sneaking around.
-It's just a filthy disgusting habit.
-Are you sure?
Positive. It's over.
-Do you wanna have one?
-A cigar?
Sometimes a cigar
is not just a cigar.
You're just crazy.
<i>And I realized that our love for</i>
<i>each other can survive even Zelda.</i>
At least I pray it will.
So you are happy again?
You're in love with mom,
everything's great?
What about the loneliness?
What about the constant fighting?
Sometimes I'm lonely,
sometimes we fight.
It's a compromise.
That's what marriage is.
One compromise after another,
and after a while you get used to it.
It's just the way things are.
It's so depressing.
Why? You were worried they might break up.
Now they're happy together.
Sure, they're together.
But who knows if they're happy?
They each want one thing,
and they settle for another.
Everybody compromises.
Who doesn't compromise?
Arabs and Republicans.
You're wrong.
Arabs live to bargain.
-Where is that little black carry-on?
-In the front hall closet.
Where are you going?
To Pittsburgh for the weekend.
It's my Dad's birthday.
He could use a little diversion.
He broke up with the woman he was seeing.
-The florist Dot?
-He claims she never bathed.
-So odd. She is not even French.
-I actually thought he might marry her.
-Your father in not compromising.
-He's alone. That is an enormous compromise.
He's not sacrificing his values.
Isn't that the definition of courage?
No, it's the definition of selfishness.
Why is this table still here?
I thought you were sending it back.
I was hoping it might
grow on you.
It's just too big.
Doesn't fit the space.
-Fine. I'll send it back.
-Thank you.
You are so pretty
sitting there.
Give me a hug.
You know what
we haven't done in a while?
I can't.
I have to rewrite a perfectly good ad.
It's 10 o'clock at night.
You can't possibly be creative at this hour.
That's what I'm hoping.
-Do you know anything about this?
-Me? No, nothing.
Why is that I never know what's going on around here?
My __ steaks are about done.
Taste if it is tender.
I know it is of course.
It's like butter
with even more cholesterol.
I think I deserve an answer.
Surely we can table this till later.
I don't think my sister needs to hear it.
Have you been in touch with Terri?
I just wanted to see my kid.
You never made an effort
to see your kid before.
Perhaps it was the shooting
that put a new perspective.
There was a shooting?
Her lunatic husband
took a shot at us last week.
He just fired over our heads.
He was trying to scare us.
It worked. I don't know how
that idiot got hold of a weapon.
It's Florida.
You get a gun if you buy a lottery ticket.
I think it's impressive
in a sad sort of way.
Perhaps you should go back to him.
Is that what you want, Jordan,
so you can go back to Terri?
I'm not going back to Terri.
She just happens to be pregnant with my kid.
You can't be serious!
I'm dead serious.
Do I hear one more thing about moisture
creams, I'm gonna blow my brains out!
It's not so glamorous anymore
and therefore you out of it.
Let's not lead to conclusions.
I just don't want end up a martyr.
Don't worry, darling. You have to care
about something before you can become a martyr.
-What does that supposed to mean?
-Fuck off.
That's nice language in front of my sister.
Those nuns have taught you well!
Can you believe this?
Me? I believe anything.
You seem a little…
Are you all right?
-We're worried about you.
-I'm fine. I appreciate your concern very much.
It looks like the Pope died.
Just once I'd like to eat
when I come to your house for a meal.
-Are you alright?
-Yes. I thought you were at Jordan's.
So did I.
What are you doing here?
This is …
-Did you have a fight with Jeff?
-No, I just…
-What?
-I didn't really… Nothing.
I feel terrible for Mitchell.
What about Jeff?
He's not gonna take this lightly
if he finds out.
He's not gonna be so mature about it.
A guy who makes his living
ripping people's heads off
cause they won't give him the ball.
-Don't you think I've thought about that?
-I don't know what you've thought about.
First you tell everyone
that you're madly in love,
Then you're having problems,
Then everything's okay, then it's not.
You're like
the Ross Perot of matrimony.
You wouldn't talk.
You haven't even
been married for 6 months.
I think I'm in love
with Mitchell.
You're kidding!
How did this happen?
Remember that day
we met at the lingerie store?
It's sort of hard to forget a man
buying lingerie for another man.
The next day he invited
us to a Halloween party.
<i>Jeff had a football game in Houston</i>
<i>and I was tired of sitting home alone.</i>
<i>So I went.</i>
Papi, you look fantastic!
Mitchell!
No, It's Fidel.
You need to be punished.
Go down and clean my game room!
I spilled some paté down there.
<i>Everybody stayed up late talking about high school.</i>
<i>I really missed my youth.</i>
<i>Yes. That must have</i>
<i>taken you back a few months.</i>
My biggest regret in life is
that I never got to sleep with you.
I thought I'd slept
with anybody that year.
Not me, I would have remembered that,
You'd have remembered that.
<i>We started talking on the phone a lot.</i>
<i>Sometimes he took me on his boat</i>
<i>or I stopped there for a cleaning.</i>
<i>I keep forgetting he is a dentist now</i>
Most kids dreaded going to the dentist.
-I used to love it.
-Of course you did.
-What did you think I was gonna be?
-I don't know.
I knew you'd be famous somehow.
Like a movie star.
They say that movie stars have "it".
That strange quality
that's magical and unforgettable.
You have "it".
And you have perfect teeth.
<i>But you were so in love with Jeff.</i>
<i>As soon as we got married</i>
<i>he turned into a different person.</i>
-Enough. Now we get ready.
-hy are we in such a rush?
You need to look great tonight.
All the other wives are gonna be there.
If we hurry,
we get the early bird parking.
<i>I had the key to your place</i>
<i>so a few days ago, on Mitchell's birthday,</i>
<i>I brought __ afternoon.</i>
You don't sound guilty at all.
Maybe you're right,
maybe I'm just a slut
or maybe some people
just fall in love a lot.
I don't understand
why you got married in the first place.
I had the same phantasy
everyone does:
meet Prince Charming
and live happily ever after.
Wanted to have a marriage
like mom and dad's.
Believe me, you did.
Mom always said to
meet lots of people,
don't settle down too fast
So I went out with a million guys
and then one day I thought
"okay, it's time".
And then there is this ceremony
I put on this ring and suddenly
I am not supposed to be attracted
to any other man. But I am.
And I don't just want to flirt with them. want to squeeze their brains out.
-I don't think we should get married.
-You are just panicking.
Panic is often a reasonable response.
Look at the facts!
50% of all marriages
end in divorce.
Not to mention all the ones
that end in __ .
Rational people
don't get married.
Rational people
don't fall in love either.
Love is great but love fades.
Look at my sister!
You sister has no self-restraint.
__
She could never work
for the post office.
Can we just decide on a cake?
Don't change the subject!
You always do that!
You think that if you don't talk about something
then it's just gonna go away.
What are you proposing?
That we just live together permanently?
A lot of people are doing it today.
It's not so unusual.
It doesn't make any sense.
What prevents me from
running off with my dentist?
Nothing. That's the point.
We're not gonna feel trapped.
Being together is gonna be an opportunity,
not an obligation.
I don't wanna live together.
I want to get married.
-So it is not dying institution?
-My parents' marriage was good.
Your parents were saints.
You think that marriage
leads to misery.
It's true! Married women
get depressed more than single women.
How can you be so sure
that we are right for each other?
Look here! "All good things come in threes."
What says that it can not happen to us?
You just want to live together?
You want to skip the wedding?
No, we can get married.
Take a cake. Anything you want
as long as it's chocolate.
¡Hey, mamá!
-How are you, dear?
-A little tired.
But it's friday and I'm going out.
-How much is it?
-No, don't. I pay for that.
-You want to go out with me?
-Me? No, Take out a young girl,
somebody who you can marry
some day.
-But I want to take you.
-No, please.
When are you going to meet some
good honest girl.
Somebody to settle down.
I don't want to settle down.
And I don't want commitments.
I want to meet my grandchildren
before I die.
What's wrong with you, Antonio?
-Are you a homosexual?
-How can you say that?
-Some people say it.
-Who?
People in the street.
They say "he doesn't have a woman
he's never had a girlfriend,
Antonio is gay"
I'll tell you something:
it's true. I'm gay.
No, I'm joking!
You believe anything.
I have a girlfriend.
You have a girlfriend?
Ask her out tonight.
Call her.
-She works late.
  -Call her anyway.
Okay, I'll call her.
Just 'cause you asked me to.
-Hi, it's Antonio. Are you busy?
-No, I only played a computer game.
Do you play computer games?
It's really mental masturbation
which is my second favorite kind.
-Yeah?
-That was a joke.
Can you do me a favor tonight?
If you don't have other plans.
-Please, say yes! Come on!
-I don't know.
It's me.
How is your day?
-It's okay. How is yours?
-Fine.
-What are we doing tonight?
-I thought I'd swing by Derek's gallery opening.
I know you don't want me to go.
But I thought since he invited us…
I'm not going.
I have to work.
-How late are you gonna work?
-Late. Have you already done dinner?
I'll just get some pizza.
-Are you happy?
-Of course, my dear.
Goodbye, Mrs. Carrera.
Nice to meet you.
-What did she say?
-She said "dance for me too".
I don't dance.
I want to make that clear right now.
Okay, we won't dance.
Matt? Thanks for coming!
I really appreciate it.
It's great stuff.
-You have always did great stuff.
-Thanks.
Honey? I'd like you to meet Matt.
-This is my wife, Delia.
-Are you married?
We met a year ago
and decided to do it.
It's amazing. We went pregnant now
and I've got to say I can't wait.
That's great.
How are you and Gwyn?
-You are amazing on the drums.
-You really think so?
-And the band's…
-They're great.
I never realized the trombone
was such an erotic instrument.
I don't understand why you get so nervous.
You are not a bad dancer.
It's a new sensation for me
maintaining control of all four limbs.
Hey, Antonio.
¿Qué pasa, amigo?
-How are you doing?
-Fine.
-Do you need a ride home or something?
-No, it's okay. We've got a car.
-Nice set of wheels, huh?
-You are not walking around.
This is not like that shit
we used to steal in Havana.
Why don't you give me a call?
I would love to take you on my boat.
-I'll call you.
-See you!
So that's why you were in jail?
You were car thief?
Yes. But I'm not __ .
-I'm a little surprised.
-Don't look down on me because of that.
I heard you were a criminal
in Cuba so I thought…
What?
That I killed someone?
In a vicious __ of stealers.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to go to the beach for coffee?
It is such a beautiful night. Come on!
It's late and I must go home.
I have to go home.
It's okay.
Another time.
Yes, hang on.
Gwyn, a phone call for you.
-Can't you take the message?
-No, I think you better take it.
Really, you did?
I'm thrilled.
I could do that.
Great. I'll see you then.
That was Charlie Drucker.
He liked my script.
He wants me to come up to Orlando next month
to cut story ideas for his new TV series.
-Great!
-I'm shocked.
What are you doing?
You're packing again.
I have to fly to New York
for a job interview
What kind of job interview?
A mountain gorilla project
is hiring researchers in Zaire.
-Do you plan to move to Africa?
-You're thinking of moving to Orlando.
That's at least
on the same continent.
Something I've wanted to do
for a long time,
and you are the one who always says
that we should never compromise.
-Aren't we getting married?
-You don't wanna get married.
-Who said that?
-You did.
I said it, but I didn't mean it.
I always say things that I don't mean.
All I know is that I am unhappy,
and I'm tired of being unhappy.
You're just leaving?
Just like that?
It isn't working anymore, Gwyn.
It's just too frustrating.
I probably should
have done this a while ago.
Yes, at least before
the invitations were printed.
I thought if I could get you
to commit to a date things would improve.
-We barely have sex once a week.
-As 98% of all married couples.
I can't believe this.
It's gone too hard, Gwyn.
It shouldn't be this hard.
You don't just walk out the door.
Not after 2 years.
I don't know what else to do.
You got paralyzed somehow.
You stopped making an effort.
Maybe I was hoping it wouldn't take any effort.
Maybe I was hoping I would just wake up one day
and everything would be perfect between us.
Can't you understand that?
No, it is never perfect.
Some days are incredible and others are shitty
And if you're lucky and you work at it
the incredible days outnumber the shitty days..
Is the law of the jungle
you learned from one of your chimps?
Let's not torture each other.
Today it can be one of our shitty days
and we can have an incredible day tomorrow!
It's too late, Gwyn.
This is it. It's over.
Please, don't go.
Can't we just talk about this?
No. That's all you do.
I don't wanna talk anymore.
-You haven't seen him at all?
-I saw him once.
He came to get his stuff
and we began to fight.
He moved in with his friend
in the Grove.
He left a message
he got that job in Africa.
It's so sad to break up.
You never think it's gonna happen to you.
I always thought
it was gonna happen to me.
A second.
Everybody.
They worship you.
I worship them.
You know…
-Your mother ended?? our thing.
-She did, really?
-When did that happen?
-A couple of weeks ago.
So she just ended it.
Just like that?
She was very nice all right.
She gave me a blazer.
I wish I could say
that I was sorry but…
It was probably for the best.
That's what she thought.
I want to ask you…
If it is too awkward just tell me.
Are you serious?
Our family model is too awkward.
I was hoping that
I could maybe take you to dinner sometime.
Are you serious?
Yes.
That is sick.
That is really disturbing.
I mean…
What are you doing tomorrow?
How much longer?
It looks like Orlando down there
so we must be landing soon.
It's amazing how high
we still are.
The cars look like insects
and the runway is tiny.
It seems impossible that we can land
on that matchstick.
Flying is not for me.
-You know how I feel about dancing.
-I have a headache.
I'm reading the pilot script
for this new sitcom they want me to write for.
-It's just awful!
-So you don't like it?
It is completely mindless.
Precocious kids in an orphanage.
It's brilliant.
It could be an __ show.
A mixture of comedy and drama
which is not oily at all.
We're killing ourselves
to entertain people who can't afford cable.
It is a thankless task.
You get paid so little to do it.
It's funny. I hope
your story is just as fun.
Yes. Two of us.
We could really
use a woman on the staff.
None of these Neanderthals
know how to make a cup coffee.
How did it go?
After watching a full rehearsal
it's still the worst sitcom in the world.
And if I'm lucky my name
will appear at episode four.
-You got it, right?
-Sort of.
He hired me
to write the script
and if he likes the script
he's gonna put me on the staff.
Congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.
-You are wet. Were you swimming?
-I went to the pool.
That's what I'm gonna do.
Then I'm gonna order about 1000
dollars worth of room service
because I'm in show business now.
So after we eat
we can trash the place.
What?
Come here.
-Don't you…?
-No talking except in Spanish.
All I know is count.
I remember.
Are we really gonna do this?
-I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?
-I have to put my thing.
-What thing?
My diaphragm.
And you should really
wear something too, young man.
We need two things?
Yes, we need two things.
We don't know where you've been.
I've been with your mother!
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I can't go on living like this.
Just terrified of anything good
that might happen to me.
-Everybody is the same way.
-No, they're not.
People don't live their lives
with this constant anxiety.
Look at you. You're happy all the time.
You are impulsive and passionate.
You live for the moment.
You're not always looking back.
I think I am still
in love with your mother.
I can't stop
thinking about her.
You're even
more pathetic than I am.
Can I call you back?
What happened?
You're kidding?
I can't believe it.
It's okay.
It's almost over.
Well?
And?
It's a girl!
I'm coming!
Oh, look at those!
-Is he here?
-He's right outside.
Tell him it's okay.
What do you think? The manufacturer
my flew here especially.
I was thinking it might be
a good name for her. Lily.
It's a pretty name.
Either that or Azaleas.
-Did you see her?
-She is beautiful.
I saw her out there in the solarium.
There is nothing solarium,
It's an incubator.
Whatever.
You did an amazing job.
-You look beautiful too.
-I feel like crap.
No, I've seen crap.
Crap doesn't glow like this.
-I should get me a closer look.
-What are you doing?
-I will lay me next to you.
-They'll kick you out!
You are crazy.
I was crazy.
I'm not crazy anymore.
-God, Jordan…
-I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It was a nice party.
It's not so bad when someone old dies.
Everyone eats.
That's it.
-Then I say good night.
-Are you leaving?
Yes, it's getting late.
Hasta luego.
Same to you.
Whatever that means.
Talk.
I can't believe
you're leaving so soon.
I have to get up early.
How early?
-I have to meet the family of my new patient.
-Oh, sure.
Good-bye, "muchacho".
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too.
We actually have something
to say to you.
We've been thinking
of moving in together.
-Where, here?
-No.
-I have a place on Coconut Grove.
-Do I have to pay for another wedding?
Excuse me, but I've got to go.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
So Antonio, you're leaving?
Hold on for a second.
-It's something I want to say to you.
-What?
I don't know
if Nina mentioned this to you.
But we are very grateful to you
for everything you've done for us.
-You don't have to give me anything.
-I know I don't have to. I want to.
Enough said.
I don't know what to say.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
62 years they were married.
Not so bad.
Here's Grandma and Grandpa
on their honeymoon.
They don't look
very comfortable with each other.
-They don't. Just met the day before.
-You're kidding.
They grew up
in a different time.
They grew up
on a different planet.
My mother had no fear at all.
Just no fear.
You know all that stuff
she lived through.
I used to ask her
how she kept her sense of humor,
how she always had hope.
She just smiled and said:
"Think of the alternative".
<i>The next morning</i>
<i>I went down to the zoo to see Matt</i>
<i>and to give him back</i>
<i>the napkin ring.</i>
<i>He wanted me to keep it</i>
<i>but I didn't think it was right.</i>
<i>Then I said</i>
<i>"maybe if it was a diamond ring",</i>
<i>He laughed.</i>
<i>He was leaving for Africa</i>
<i>the next day</i>
<i>so we talked about his new job</i>
<i>and we talked about my new job</i>
<i>and about us</i>
<i>and about how strange it was</i>
<i>that my parents</i>
<i>after everything that had happened</i>
<i>had managed to stay married.</i>
<i>And Terri had somehow found</i>
<i>a way to forgive Jordan</i>
<i>And that Leslie already seemed</i>
<i>to be heading towards her second marriage.</i>
<i>Here we were saying goodbye</i>
<i>in the monkey habitat.</i>
<i>Then I told him that</i>
<i>I was gonna miss him</i>
<i>and he said something</i>
<i>really sweet.</i>
<i>He was glad that I came by</i>
<i>because it made him realize</i>
<i>that we weren't crazy</i>
<i>for falling in love with each other</i>
<i>even if the love didn't last.</i>
So I'm alone again.
Which scares me a little bit.
I don't wanna end up alone.
I don't wanna end up
like one of those shriveled old women
who throw birthday parties
for their cats.
I still don't understand.
Why did I turned off to Matt like that?
And what about Antonio?
So he was in love with my mother,
we could have worked through that.
But then what?
Do I really wanna
get married at all?
I look at my family and all that pain
and frustration and loneliness.
And those are
healthy marriages now
and I wonder is it worth it.
Is a lifetime of love
and friendship and children
worth all the compromise
that goes with it?
I guess the answer is "yes".
I guess I still have hope.
I look at marriage
the same way I look at Miami.
It's hot and it's stormy
and it's occasionally a little dangerous
but if it's really so awful
why is there still so much traffic?
