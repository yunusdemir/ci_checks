Come on. Come get some bread.
Don't you want any? Come on.
Come on. Here you go.
Go on. Here you go.
So! You've been giving them wheat, have you?.
My seed, eh??!.
You've gone up in the world.
Is that it?.
Is that what you think?.
I'll give you something to think about!
Now, get out of here!
(WOMAN) You've only been gone an hour.
- What's he done?.
- Nothing.
Did he hit you?.
Shame on you for letting him.
His father was my father's journeyman.
Keep in.
Mr Fawley!
- Should I take this off?.
- For five seconds.
Stay still everyone.
Come on, if you're coming, then.
- Have you finished your work?.
- Yeah.
Good boy.
- Come on. Come on.
- All right.
You look sad, Jude. Are you sorry I'm going?.
- Yeah.
- So am I.
- Where are you going, sir?.
- Christminster.
Why do you have to go?.
Do you know what a university is?.
A university degree?.
Do you see it, over there?.
That's Christminster.
If you want to do anything in lfe, Jude,
that's where you have to go.
even if it means giving up
everything else for a while.
You have to read your books
while your friends are out playing.
Get out of bed
early in the morning when it's freezing cold.
Study every chance you get.
One day it'll all pay off, I promise you.
Once you're there, everything is open to you.
You can become anything you want.
You can choose your future.
- Dinner!
- Come on.
Hurry up, Jude.
- Staying to eat with us today, Jude?.
- No.
Have a piece of this cheese, you'll love it.
- Who's waiting?. Chip off the old block, eh?.
- Is she a looker?.
(Reading in Ancient Greek)
"Swiftly she rose
from the grey sea lke a mist."
(Ancient Greek)
"My child, why do you weep??"
(Girls laughing)
(WOMAN) Here's the poet.
- Thank you very much.
- I didn't throw it.
Nor me. I didn't throw it, I tell you.
I don't even lke the look of him.
- None of you threw it.
- What's wrong with him?.
- I think he's quite nice.
- He's all right. He's just standing there.
- Oh, look. You've scared him off now.
- He's shy.
I bet you think I threw it.
No.
Well I did.
But don't tell anyone.
My name's Arabella.
My father's a pig breeder.
We were washing innards for black pudding.
- What?.
- Nothing.
I don't work Sundays. You can see me then.
- Did you catch anything?.
- No. I should have thrown something else.
(Reading in Latin)
- Now all you do is read?.
- Yes.
Nothing else?.
- What do you read?.
- Latin, some Greek.
I have read two books of the Iliad, Thucydides,
Hesiod, some of the Greek testament.
Hoity-toity!
Well I need to to get into Christminster.
Christminster (??)
Yes. I'm going to be a scholar.
- Maybe even a professor one day.
- My, my.
- Have you ever seen me clmb a tree?.
- No.
(She laughs)
I've got something to show you, Jude.
Where are you?.
(She giggles)
Get up, Abby.
Why?.
I want to kiss you.
Kiss me lke this.
Be careful I'm hatching an egg.
I carry it with me everywhere.
It'll hatch in three days.
Why do you do that?.
It's natural for a woman
to bring a lve thing into the world.
- Jude?.
- Yes.
It's late.
To the bride and the groom!
We'll send that to Aunt Drusilla.
Aunt Drusilla.
- What should we call her?.
- Rosie's pig.
- What about Jemima Spot?.
- Do you lke that?.
(JUDE) It isn't your own?.
So?.
What?.
- You've got enough of your own.
- It's very fashionable in London.
(JUDE) Do you care
what people think in London?.
Don't you lke it?.
- No.
- Then I won't wear it.
Leave it on.
I want to see us. You can close your eyes
if you lke and pretend it's dark.
Jude. Ask me nicely.
- Ask you what?.
- What you want me to do.
- I don't know.
- What??!.
We'll just have to make it up.
He's never going to get here.
He's probably bloody drunk.
We'll just have to do it ourselves.
- Be careful with those.
- Then find somewhere else for them.
This table is for the lard.
(Pig squeals)
Right, move her.
- Where do you want it?.
- On this side.
(Pig screams)
(Pig falls silent)
Thank God it's dead.
What's God got to do with pig killing?.
It's a bit late to be looking at other women.
I won't feel sorry for you.
You should have lstened to me.
Fawleys are not cut out for marriage.
- I didn't have a choice.
- You had no brains.
- Five months gone and not even a bump.
- Please don't say that.
Shall I get your room ready?.
No, I'd better go.
(ARABELLA) "Dear Jude, I've decided
to leave, and I won't be back.
"I know you think
I tricked you into marrying me,
"but I swear
I really believed I was pregnant.
"I'm going to Australia to start again.
"Perhaps now you'll be free
to go to Christminster
"and become a university man.
"Good luck. "
(WOMAN) Can I help you?.
..then there's your back-to- back houses,
your grubby children hanging off scaffolding.
It's the same city.
Maybe a five-minute walk
from Church Street to "Scum Street".
Why don't we go over?.
Why don't we go over and knock on their doors?.
Because they've convinced us this is
the way it is. No change. Why change?.
They've won the argument.
They educate their kind to win the argument.
I'm looking for Jude Fawley.
I beleve he works here.
- You'll find him around the corner, miss.
- Thank you.
Jude Fawley?. I'm your cousin, Sue Bridehead.
Aunt Drusilla wrote and told me
you were in Christminster.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Don't take this wrongly,
but you don't look lke cousins.
- Why is that?.
- You're pretty, and he's got a stone for a face.
- A big nose is a sign of nobilty.
- Shut up.
They have the same noses. Look at them.
One each, right in the middle of their faces.
- Tell me some more about my cousin.
- He's a scholar, a true scholar.
- He's a sinner.
- Why is that?.
- What was the last one calledd?.
- Oh, you mean Vicky.
- No, Florence,
- The one before Elspeth.
- Mm...nice, isn't it?.
- Oh, lovely.
Nothing up the sleeve, right?.
Oh, yes! Now, that is good, that is good.
(Jude reciting in Ancient Greek)
Jude. Jude!
Jude!
Not there, it's bad luck.
They used to burn martyrs there.
- Are you superstitious, Jude?.
- No.
Nor am I, but I think
it's better to be safe, don't you?.
- Where are we going?.
- Somewhere lving, away from this university.
- But it's wonderful here.
- It's all stone.
- The buildings, yes. I meant the scholars.
- I was talking about the scholars, too.
Finish it.
- How much are these two, please?.
- Ten shillings.
- You're not going to buy them?.
- Why not?.
- Would you lke me to wrap them up?.
- No, thank you.
- Why have you wrapped them up?.
- To avoid giving my landlady a heart attack.
- You're being rather confrontational
- No, I just wonder why you go to church at all
Because a part of me is still
a superstitious, backward country girl
- You mean, lke me?.
- I didn't know you were a girl
Do I irritate you?.
No.
even when I'm trying to prove
how much cleverer than you I am?.
You are.
- Don't say that.
- Why not?.
Because it's not the sort of thing
you should admit to.
Why not, if it's true?.
- Say something.
- I enjoy lstening to you.
Catullus.
(Reading in Latin)
"God, lke the man who sits at her side
"Who watches and catches the laughter
which softly tears me to tatters
"Nothing is left of me
each time I see her."
Beautiful
What does the law say
about marrying your cousin?.
It's not about that. It says nothing about
falling in love with them. Quite common, I hear.
- What do you think, Jude?.
- You two are cousins, you tell me.
- Sue?.
- How do you know?.
- You've got a woman's hands.
- You'll have to do better than that.
- "Pruples" doesn't count.
- You've been following me?.
I came to say goodbye.
- Won't you introduce me to your friend?.
- It's Wilkes.
How do you do, Mr Wilkes?.
- Why are you leaving?.
- I had a row with my landlady.
She found a statue, threw it on the floor
and ground the head to pieces with her heel
She made sure I lost my job as well
- Where will you go?.
- I don't know. I'm going to teach somewhere.
- You can teach here in Christminster.
- everyone in this city is a teacher, Jude.
I've got a friend who can help. Mr Phillotson.
I was his pupil in Marygreen.
Don't worry about me.
I was going to look him up, anyway.
No harm in asking.
Why do you want me to stay?.
Because we've only just met.
- Mr Phillotson?.
- Yes.
My name is Jude Fawley.
I was your pupil in Marygreen.
Yes, of course you were.
- Are you an old pupil too?.
- No, this is my cousin, Sue Bridehead.
Mr Phillotson, you once showed me
Christminster, the same day you left Marygreen.
I came here because of you, sir,
to become a university man.
Through here.
I gave up the idea of university a long time ago.
Other dreams have replaced it.
I'm very happy as a schoolmaster.
Here we are.
Sue's been looking for work as a teacher.
- You've already had some experience.
- No.
Is it very hard to find work?.
- I'm thinking of applying to a training colledge.
- That's always a good idea.
What I need for this school
is a second-year transfer.
- What about an apprentice?.
- Jude!
- Are you serious about being a teacher, Sue?.
- Yes, of course.
I'm sure it will be useful for both of you.
- I can't afford to pay you very much.
- That doesn't matter.
All right, then.
(PHILLOTSON) One times seven?.
(PUPILS) Seven.
- Two times seven?.
- 14.
- Three times seven?.
- 21.
- Four times seven?.
- 28.
- Bye, Miss.
- Bye.
Mount of Olves, Mount Moriah.
The Valley of Jehoshaphat.
The City of Zion.
Calvary. All names
at the very root of our history.
This is an exact model of the City of Jerusalem
as it was at the time of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
And they took Jesus
through these hot, dusty, narrow streets...
How does anyone know what Jerusalem
looked lke then?. I'm sure he doesn't.
Of course he does. The model is copied
from the best conjectural maps.
Why Jerusalem?.
Why not Athens, Rome or Alexandria?.
Because of what Jerusalem means to us
as Christians. Surely you must see that?.
- Why are you so sceptica?.
- I'm not, I was just pointing out...
Jude!
- What a surprise!
- No, it isn't. You knew I was here.
- You've been watching me all the time.
- Mr Phillotson.
Jude. Your cousin is such a clever girl
she criticises all this unmercifully.
Please don't call me a clever girl
There are too many of us these days.
- I didn't mean anything.
- I know you didn't. Come on, Jude.
(LECTURER) This accusation, written:
"This is Jesus, the king of the Jews. "
- He wanted to impress you.
- Not cleverly done.
He can't be clever. He's fond of you.
I 'm fond of him, too.
It doesn't mean I go around patronising him.
I don't feel at all guilty.
(Reading Ancient Greek)
"Tell me, Muse, a man, many ways
"who wandered far and wide
after he sacked the holy city of Troy."
- Will you kiss it for luck?.
- No.
A letter for the Dean of Admissions.
They took it.
Want a hat, Jude?.
- What's the problem?.
- It's raining.
- It's what?.
- Thought you were the intelligent one.
(Knock at door)
Sue!
"Sir, I have read your letter with interest,
"and judging from your description
ofyourself as a working man,
"I think you have
a much better chance of success in life
"by sticking to your own trade
than by adopting any other course.
"Yours sincerely, the Dean of Admissions. "
(JUDE) I don't give a damn for any provost,
ward, principal or bloody Master of Arts.
I 'd lck them on their own ground
if they'd give me the chance.
We learned more outside the book, than in.
- Can you say the Creed in Latin?.
- Yes, I can, I definitely can.
excuse me. Quiet, please, quiet!
The gentleman in the corner is to rehearse
the articles of his belef in the Latin tongue
for the edification of this company.
- Thank you.
- Here's your chance.

You bloody fools.
Which one of you knows
if I said it right or not?.
It might be The Ratcatcher's Daughter
in double Dutch for all you know.
(Knocking on window)
(JUDE) Sue! Sue!
Jude...?.
I've been drinking, Sue.
- Will you let me in?.
- All right.
- I can do it.
- Jude.
You'll learn more than they can ever teach you.
I'm sure this is the last thing you want to hear,
but you don't need a double first from
Christminster to do some good in the world.
- You should try to eat something.
- He's too old for you.
I'll bring you breakfast in the morning.
Out of work already?.
Hello.
Don't you make a fool of yourself over her, Jude.
Marrying Arabella was
the worst thing you ever did, until now.
Don't say that.
Your parents couldn't lve together
and nor could Sue's.
They made each other's lves a lving hell
and left you two as good as orphans.
- They were a different generation.
- With the same curse over their heads.
- The Fawleys are not meant for marrying.
- That's an old wives' tale.
Since when did you stop beleving in them?.
(SUE) "Dear Jude,
I'm writing from Melchester,
"where Mr Phillotson and I have moved.
"He is teaching at a new school
and I am studying at a training college.
"The rules here are strict beyond belief
and our visiting hours are limited,
"but I would love to see you again. "
Your hands are rough, Jude.
So would yours be
if they held a mallet and chisel all day.
I lke them, they are noble hands.
What's wrong?.
It'll take me a while to get used to you again.
- I come here to forget Melchester.
- So where are we?.
France, Australa, Spain, Canada, Timbuktu.
- Is it that bad at the training schoo?.
- Yes.
It's only another year.
Mr Phillotson thinks he can get me a good job
when I've finished.
- How is he?.
- He's been such a help.
I'm sure he has.
- Are you being silly?.
- No.
Jude?.
I didn't realse he took
a long-term interest in your future.
- He's a friend.
- I'm sure he doesn't see it that way.
- An old man lke him?.
- He isn't that old.
You said so yourself.
- What's the matter?.
- I wish you would be more open with me.
All right, he asked me to marry him.
- What did you say?.
- I said I'd think about it.
I'm sorry,
maybe I shouldn't have asked you to visit.
I'm not visiting, I've moved to Melchester.
Jude!
Jude!
Let me in.
They locked me up for being out with you,
so I jumped out the window,
crossed the deepest river in England,
and here I am.
I can't get warm.
- I'll borrow some clothes from the landlady.
- Don't do that, for God's sake!
Then you'll have to wear some of mine.
- How about this?.
- It might be a bit small
I'll wait outside.
- I brought you some brandy.
- No glass?.
- In the cupboard. I'd have to clean them.
- Don't worry, I'll drink it lke a man.
- What will they say at the schoo?.
- I don't care.
- I'll go back as soon as they're dry.
- It's late.
You could stay here tonight.
I wish I could get warm.
- Thank you, Jude.
- For what?.
For being here.
- I'm glad you came to me.
- There's no one else.
I should let you sleep.
Yes.
I couldn't sleep.
Why are you looking at me lke that?.
- Does it frighten you?.
- No. I'm not afraid of any man.
Why not?.
Because no man will touch a woman
unless she invites him to.
Until she says with a look or a smile,
"Come on", he's always afraid.
If you never say it or look it,
he'll never come.
You are the timid sex.
Shall I try again...
..to close my eyes and fall asleep?.
Good morning, Jude.
Morning.
- Can we talk?.
- Yes.
- Is it about her running away from the schoo?.
- And coming to you that night.
There have been rumours. She's been expelledd
from school because of them.
- That isn't fair.
- Jude.
I want to be able to defend her against
any scandal I need to know what happened.
Nothing happened.
- Is that the truth?.
- So help me God.
She stayed with me, but as a cousin.
Then we must both help her now.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Did you go to the schoo?.
- Yes. They won't take me back.
They think you and I
are having some kind of affair.
They even suggested I marry you
for the sake of my reputation.
- I saw Mr Phillotson today. He said he'd help.
- I don't want his help.
He was anxious. He cares for you very much.
I know.
- I have never told you about my past.
- Go on, then, tell me about it.
I'm married, Sue.
I haven't seen her for years,
but I'm still married.
Why are you telling me this?.
Because it's the only obstacle.
Obstacle to what?. I don't love you!
I don't want to be your wife!
(Weeping quietly)
You are our closest mutual friend, Jude.
We thought you ought to be the first to know.
Richard asked me to marry him, and I said yes.
That's wonderful Congratulations.
I'm very happy for you.
So are we.
- When did you decide?.
- I've been asking Sue for months now.
This time it was her idea.
- I know it's the right decision.
- Jude helped me make up my mind.
I know. I hope my cousin will make you
very happy, Mr Phillotson.
Jude, I have something to ask you.
Will you give me away?.
I have no other family here.
Of course I'll give you away.
With all my heart.
Are you ready with that yet?. Hurry up, then.
You are "father", you know.
That's what they call
the man who gives you away.
Was it lke this when you were married?.
- Can I get you a drink, sir?.
- Thanks, Arabella. I'll have a pint and a whisky.
- Aren't you supposed to be a Christminster don?.
- Aren't you supposed to be in Australa?.
Change, Arabella.
He's on the house.
- Who's that, Bella?.
- That's just my husband.
Can I have a pint now, please?.
Cheers!
You know how I said I was pregnant
when we got married?.
Jude?.
Jude...?.
I met someone in Sydney.
I didn't tell him about us.
It wasn't as nice as our wedding.
She'll find me lying here as still as Lazarus.
And then I'll suddenly open my eyes.
Sue Bridehead, you lttle fool
I'll say it straight out.
You'll regret this marriage as much as
that ox of a cousin of yours regretted his.
Are you crying for me...
or for your precious Sue?.
You ninny.

- How long are you staying?.
- Just tonight. I have to go back tomorrow.
- I wish I'd seen her before she died.
- She was looking forward to seeing you, too.
- What did she say?.
- That we both made bad husbands and wives.
(A rabbit screams in pain)
(Painful squealing)
(He snaps its neck)
It shouldn't be allowed to set those traps.
- Did it wake you?.
- I was already awake.
- Why?.
- I was thinking.
About what?.
I don't know.
(SUE) "Dearest Jude, I should never
have written this letter,
"and I beg you not to reply.
"Richard and I are husband and wife.
"Nothing can change that...
"not your frustration,
"nor my regret.
"Please try to forget me. "
(Piano being played)
- Jude?.
- How do you know?.
You've got man's hands.
- Did you get my letter?.
- Yes, but I never opened it.
Don't worry,
I haven't moved to Shaston this time.
- You say it lke you've given up with me.
- Do you blame me?.
I'm here, aren't I?.
Promise me you'll never stop trying, Jude.
- That must sound terrible.
- Yes, it does.
Will you promise me that?.
I can't help myself.
Jude?.
- Sue didn't tell me you were coming.
- I didn't know.
That's a wonderful surprise for both of us.
How long are you staying?.
My train leaves in an hour.
Sue's hardly had a chance to see you.
Maybe you can persuade Jude to stay.
- How is the school at Marygreen?.
- The same.
Still the one classroom?.
Same desks.
- everything all right, Jude?.
- Yes.
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight.
Sue?.
- What are you doing?.
- What's wrong with me, Jude?.
Not a thing.
"When I do count the clock that tells the time
"and see the brave day's sun
and hideous night. When I behold...
"..and the summer's green
all girded up in sheaves,
"borne on the bier
with white and bristly beard."
I have a wife I love, who not only
doesn't love me, but I disgust her.
And this morning
she asked me if she could leave
to lve with you.
- I won't oppose it if that's what you want.
- Well it is.
I always noticed something extraordinary
between the two of you.
I kept telling myself it was because you were
cousins, but it's more than that.
Sometimes I think you are
one person splt in two.
You knew all along
she'd made a mistake marrying me.
- Yes.
- But you did nothing to stop us.
No.
Nor did I.
- I'll check to see if you've forgotten anything.
- I don't think I have, thank you.
- What time is the train, Jude?.
- Leaves in five minutes.
Goodbye, Richard.
Bye.
Yes!
Jude! Jude!
I brought your dinner.
(SUE) Domestic laws should take
into account different temperaments.
I may want to lve with a man,
but only as a friend.
- That may not be fair on the man.
- Because there are no precedents.
- His pride is hurt.
- But you want to marry someone you love.
Why do people have to be told to love each
other by someone else?. That's all marriage is.
- A government stamp. A lcence to love.
- If we could, would you want to marry?.
I'd run a mile if you had a piece of paper
that forced me to love you.
Oh, please!
- Drink up.
- Oh, another go. Another go.
Drink up, drink up, drink up.
Ugh!
You love it, you lar.
- What?.
- What's wrong?.
Don't touch me lke that.
- It's just affections.
- Does it pull you to something else?.
Something else?. What something else?.
I think neither of us know the meaning of it.
I'm sorry. It's just that I want everything
to be perfect between us.
I'm not ready, Jude.
- Do you understand?.
- I'll try.
What are you writing?.
Whatever his wife wants.
- Tea.
- Thanks.
"Here les my husband Peter Porter, age 51.
"He tormented me, he cheated on me
and he spent all our food money on beer."
- He's dead, Sue.
- He can't hear me.
(Knock at door)
Tell him I'll have his headstone ready
in an hour.
(Knock at door)
Arabella?.
Sorry to come here, Jude. I didn't want to.
- I'm in trouble. I need to talk to you.
- What's wrong?.
I don't want to cause any trouble for you.
Can we talk somewhere else?.
- All right.
- I'm staying at the King's Head.
- It was Arabella. She wants to talk with me.
- Can't she talk outside?.
- She wants me to go to a hotel
- That's convenient.
- Sue, I have to help her.
- Why?. She's not your wife.
She's going to give you what you want.
Can't you see what she's doing?.
She wants you back.
But do you want me?.
Yes.
Close your eyes.
- You don't have to do this.
- I want to.
But you have to help me. I don't know
what I'm doing. I only pretend.
- Do I talk too much?.
- No.
- I'm doing it all wrong, aren't I?.
- No.
- I'm intelledctualsing.
- You're not.
Kiss me before I start talking again.
You look pleased with yourself.
I'm cooking you bacon
and sausage and eggs.
- Why?.
- Because you think you deserve it.
There's a letter for you on the table.
- Aren't you going to open it?.
- I'll read it later.
Jude, I know who it's from.
(ARABELLA) "Dearest Jude,
I'm writing with this news
"because I never got the chance
to tell you face to face.
"There was a boy born of our marriage
eight months after I left you.
"So far, the boy has been
with my parents in Sydney,
"but they can no longer afford to keep him,
and nor can I.
"I named him after you. "
Are you Jude Fawley?.
Yes, sir.
This is your father. My name is Sue.
It's nice to meet you.
- How was your journey?.
- Fine, thank you.
- Can I carry this?.
- Yes.
(SUE) What Arabella says is true.
He's yours. I can see you in him.
But the other half is her.
- You'll protect me, won't you?.
- If I can.
Can you beleve your eyes?.
Is the world really as it seems?.
I can see you smilng, convinced that nothing
can surprise you any more. You've seen it all
Well tonight, I'll surprise you.
I'll show you wonders.
I'll show you a world you've only glmpsed
in your darkest dreams.
Out of thin air, the terrors come!
(MIDWIFE) Not much longer now.
You all right?.
It's nothing to be frightened of. Come here.
- No, baby, don't cry.
- Juey, can you help me, please?.
Can you help me?. Hold baby for me.
Support her head.
Look, I've got the baby.
Be careful
(Baby crying)
Morning.
Jude, can I have a word?.
- Who are they?.
- Daddy's going to talk to them.
The work is going fine.
Jude, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to get
someone else to finish it for you.
- Why?.
- Some of the parishioners have complained.
- About what?.
- You never told us you weren't married.
I never realsed that was
a necessary qualfication for a stonemason.
I'll pay you for the week's work, of course.
I'm sorry, Jude.
Six shillings. Yes, madam, seven shillings.
Is she going to get them?.
Yes, she is. Thank you, madam.
We got a couple of rabbits. Black and white.
If you take the skin off, they look the same.
They'll be a very nice Sunday lunch
for someone.
Come on. Four pence, five pence.
Seven pence to the gentleman out there.
It's going to be lke this everywhere we go
as soon as people find out we're not married.
We'll move on.
We move somewhere where nobody knows us.
If they find out, we move on again,
and again and again...
..as long as it takes for the world to change.
We've done nothing wrong, Sue.
You're the one who taught me that.
Juey.
- Juey!
- Juey!
Take care of your sister.
How do you do, Mrs Fawley. Arabella Wilkinson.
- You look sick, Jude.
- Thank you.
There's even gables and lttle windows.
How very sweet.
Still harping on about Christminster.
- How are you?.
- All right.
My husband died, left me everything.
- What would you lke?.
- Oh, I think I'll have a whole colledge.
Which was the colledge that refused you, Jude?.
Well I shan't have that one.
You were such a proud man, Jude.
Jude.
Hello.
- Don't you recognise your ma, then?.
- Yeah.
- I bought you some cake. Would you lke some?.
- No, thank you.
- I think your lttle sister would lke some.
- She's too small
But you are big, though.
How old are you now?.
Eight.
ARABELLA)
Eight years, three months and six days.
I remember exactly.
Eight was my favourite age.
- I bet you want to be nine, though?.
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you married yet?.
- No.
- Be all right if I kiss you, then?.
- Yeah.
You're a good boy, Jude.
What is it?.
I want to go back to Christminster.
- Because Arabella hurt your pride?.
- Because I still have some.
(JUDE) * The crow flew over the bush
The crow flew over the bush
# The crow flew over the bush #
What do you think he saw?.
- Guess who?.
- I know that voice anywhere. Uncle Joe.
Jim! Take your tail up. Over here. I've found
the tutor of St Slum's Colledge, Christminster.
Hey, hey! Can you still say
the Apostle's Creed in Latin, Jude.
"Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem."
Look at you, Jude.
What have you been doing with yourself?.
He's got himself more mouths to feed.
- You remember my friends, don't you?.
- Yes, of course.
So cousins do get married.
- My eldest, lttle Jude.
- Oh, what's wrong with you, lttle man?.
- He's tired.
- Nothing.
We've been looking out for you
in the parade every year.
Never thought we'd find you in the crowd.
Things turned out differently.
- No regrets, I hope?.
- Some.
Difficult question for any man to answer.
To follow his dreams no matter what, or
give in slowly and let lfe lead him where it will
And which are you?.
I don't know.
When I first came here to Christminster,
I had a neat stock of fixed opinions.
The further I get,
the less sure I am of anything.
Hear, hear.
"Who knoweth what is good for man in this lfe?.
"And who can tell a man
what shall be after him under the sun??"
- We're looking for somewhere to stay.
- We don't take children.
- We're looking for somewhere to stay.
- No, I'm sorry. No room.
- We're looking for somewhere to stay.
- How many children are there?.
Two children and a baby.
- I have got a room.
- Thank you, thank you.
Juey, Lizzy, come up.
I'll look for work in the morning.
- How did they know?.
- She asked if we were married.
- You said we weren't?.
- I couldn't le.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I won't hide it from anyone.
(Knock on door)
It's open.
I'm sorry, my husband is a bit unhappy
about the lttle ones staying.
- We can't leave now, not in this rain.
- I know, I said that to him.
- Staying one night is fine.
- But we agreed a week.
Thank you very much. We'll look for
new lodgings first thing in the morning.
- Why do you give in?.
- What difference does it make?.
Sshhh, nearly done.
I love this place.
even though I know
it looks down on people lke me.
The self-taught, the too-determined.
It takes two or three generations to do
what I tried to do in one.
You're still Joseph, the dreamer of dreams.
And the tragic Don Quixote.
Sometimes you're a St Stephen...
..who sees Heaven open up,
even as they're stoning him.
(JUEY) I cannot sleep.
- Come and sleep with us.
- Is it because of me we have to leave?.
No, Juey...because there's too many of us.
There isn't enough room. Go to bed now.
Go to bed. Go to bed!
I'll go and talk to him.
- What are you doing?.
- Watching them sleep.
They love you very much, Juey.
You're their older brother.
If they see you upset, they get upset, too.
You have to be strong for them.
If there's too many children in the world,
why do people have more?.
I don't know.
Because they love each other,
or because they don't think.
It just happens that way.
Mum said there were too many of us.
She didn't mean you.
There aren't enough of you.
Are you ready for bed?.
Come on.
Good night, son.
I'd lke to buy myself a dress with flowers,
flounces and ribbons. And I need a hat.
- Of course you do.
- With exotic flowers growing out of it.
Oh, Jude. We could buy... We could buy clothes.
We could buy anything we wanted, really.
- Juey in school
- We could.
- Can I tell him?.
- Yes, you tell him.
I'll tell him. I'll tell him!
Sshh, they must be asleep.
What is it?.
(She weeps)
(She screams)
(She shouts and weeps)
"For we are made as a spectacle unto
the world, and unto angels and to men.
"even to this present hour we both hunger
and thirst, and are naked and are buffeted,
"and have no certain dwelling place.
"Being reviled, we bless.
Being persecuted, we suffer it.
"Being defamed, we entreat.
"We are made as the filth of the world, and
are the offscouring of all things unto this day.
"I write not these things to shame you,
but, as my beloved sons, to warn you."
Shall we go?.
- Sue?.
- I want to be with my children.
I'll wait for you by the gates.
I should have kept him myself.
None of this would have ever happened.
If I had come back to you...
If...
- If...
- Arabella, please.
I thought about it.
- Did you ever?.
- No.
It wasn't your fault, Jude.
- Why won't you look at me?.
- Because it's wrong.
We have to be punished.
Haven't we been punished enough?.
Our love is wrong.
That's why the children died.
We defied him, and now he's punishing us.
- Who?.
- God.
God has nothing to do with it.
You of all people know that.
- I was wrong.
- And now you can see clearly, in this state?.
- I'm trying to explain things.
- There's nothing to explain.
- It was an accident.
- It was judgement.
On what?.
Why do you talk lke this?.
We've done nothing wrong.
"We are made a spectacle unto the world,
and unto angels and to men."
Sue.
- Sue, where are you going?.
- Your child killedd mine.
- Your child killedd my babies.
- Sue, please.
How can I look at you?. How can I lve with you?.
Do you beleve in God?. You think so, yes.
(Inaudible)
How many times have you missed
a church service in your lfe?. Why?.
What are you reading at the moment?.
- What do you want with me?.
- Come home.
- You don't know my badness.
- Yes, I do.
You make me hate Christianity and God
and whatever has reduced you to this state.
- It's right that I suffer.
- It's wrong.
That a woman lke you
should give up her mind, degrade herself...
Don't talk to me lke that!
- I'm sorry.
- Doesn't matter.
- Listen to me.
- Come home.
No, I can't.
- It's all right, Jude. I know what to do.
- We'll talk in the morning.
I have to go back to Richard in the morning.
- You go, too. Write to Arabella, ask her to...
- They mean nothing to us.
- We're still married.
- You and I are married!
But not in Heaven, not in this church!
I married Richard in a church, Jude.
- I want to go back to him.
- Do you care for him?. Do you love him?.
- I'll learn to love him.
- No. How can you, Sue?.
You love me, Sue!
Say it, Sue.
Say it. Say it. Say it.
I don't love you any more.
I'll pray for us, Jude.
Not for me.
(He coughs)
- How are you?.
- All right.
- You look well
- Do I?.
- Where are you lving now?.
- Quite far.
- You won't tell me where?.
- You wouldn't know it.
- I'd better go.
- I'll follow you.
I won't stop trying, I promised you that.
- Jude.
- Do you love me?.
Do you still love me?.
I won't come again, if that's what you want,
but I need to know.
You've always known.
Sue, come with me.
No, Jude.
We are man and wife,
if ever two people were on this earth!
