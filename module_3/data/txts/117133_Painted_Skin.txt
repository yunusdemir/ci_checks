These treats aren't cheap.
Of course not!
Since she came to the store, business is getting better.
Today, we are treating! Enjoy!
Okay! Let's eat.
Smells good!
Taste really good!
I'll dig in, okay?
Really good!
Today, we all have the chance to have a feast.
It's all thanks to Xiao Wei.
She helped me to convince the chef
Sister Pei Rong, you kept me.
It's the right thing for me to do.
It's hard to find someone so beautiful and kind hearted.
Sit down!
That's right!
Xiao Wei helped to care around the house and the business.
I should thank her.
Sister Pei Rong, don't be too formal.
Since everyone is here,
I would like to swear in front of everyone.
Xiao Wei, I would like to become your sworn sister.

In the future, you're no longer a guest.
because this is your home,
and you're no longer alone because I'm your sister
Sheng Ge is your brother-in-law.
You can talk to me if you have a problem,
and Sheng Ge will stand up for you if you're bullied.
Just know that we are a family. Do you mind this?
How can I mind? We will follow Sheng Ge's idea.
Actually, I have that thought as well.
It's a good thing! How can I not agree?
Then it's confirmed then?
Great!
To be able to be a part of the Wang family
is a wonderful thing for me.
Congratulation Ms. Xiao Wei.
Congratulation!
Since everyone is so happy today,
I would like to announce something as well.
Brother Sheng...
I have decide to leave the Wang family.
Gao Xiang! What's the matter?
Brother Sheng, listen to me.
The days with our brothers here is something
 I will never forget.
Your kindness is etched in my heart.
I want to spend more time with Ling Ling and our child,
so I decide to bid farewell to all.
They agreed.
In the future, no matter where I am,
we will all still be good brothers.
I, Gao Xiang, apologize to everyone.
Gao Xiang, just like you've said
No matter where we are, we're good brothers!
I support you.
Thank you, Brother Sheng.
Brother Gao, we support you.
Great!
Cheers!
Come!
Today, I thank everyone! I'll make a toast for you,
and hope that our business will continue to grow
and hope that there will be peace,
 so that the Wang's don't have to go to war anymore.
Cheers!
Master, Missie! Bad News!
Next door, the house is on fire!
Hurry!
Let's go!
Hurry, grab some water.
Be careful!
Over there...
We're coming.
Hurry!
Hurry.
Grab some water!
Water is here.
Save them!
Hurry!
My son is inside.
Please save him!
Be careful!
Sheng Ge...you're up! You scared me!
Pei Rong...I can't even save one,
and I have you all worrying about me! I'm sorry.
Look at you! What nonsense is that?
you're afraid of fire! Why did you go in?
I didn't know that I'm so afraid of fire
How can I be?
I'm not willing to fear fire.
Pei rong! Do you know
I feel so useless.
How can I be so useless?
The fire is big. Everyone fears it
No! Gao Xiang and they won't be.
None of the Wang soldiers were afraid.
Why compare yourself to Gao Xiang and the others?
 You're better than they are in other things.
I was really scared.
I can never forget what happened in Lang Ya Yi.
I was really really scared.
All right. All right.
Don't think of silly things.
Stop thinking about things like that and you'll be fine.
Son! Son!
Father!
Son!
Son!
Mother!
Mother!
-Father!
-Son!
Father! Mother!
Father!
Mother!
Xiao Wei, it's late, and you're still up?
Are you still up too?
Is something bothering you?
I'll tell you.
but you can't tell anyone, okay?
Okay.
The fire tonight has brought back many memories.
Me too.
Xiao Wei, it's okay.
Tell me about it, and you'll feel better.
My house was burnt down,
and then I was kidnapped.
But luckily, you saved me.
Even now, it is still scary when
I think about what happened then.
I was cold and hungry everyday, and they abused me.
Every night now,
I am very afraid.
I am afraid...
I am afraid to wake up.
I find myself back there again.
Xiao Wei, listen to me.
It's all in the past. You're safe now.
I know.
And what's bothering you?
Nothing is bothering me.
I've told you my problems.
It's your turn now. It's only fair.
Didn't you just say that
you'll feel better after talking about your problems?
You taught me that.
I have a fear of fire.
Fear of fire?
That's it?
My fear of fire is what is on my mind.
Really? Fear of fire?
Why do you fear fire?
I am not sure.
Maybe it is because of my family.
You know that I am not from Tai Yuan.
My hometown is in Lang Ya Yi.
Lang Ya Yi was also burnt down by the Tsar Bandits.
Is that why you have a fear of fire?
Correct.
I have always felt responsible for what happened.
If I hadn't ran away that day,
I doubt that it would have been that easy
for the Tsar bandits to attack the village.
And my parents would not have died.
I remember I had a fight with my father that day,
so I ran away from home. When I went back,
my parents were already dead.
And later because of revenge,
you nearly died in the fire,
didn't you, Brother Sheng?
How do you know that?
I can read minds. Do you believe me?
Pei Rong must have told you, didn't she?
A man who is
afraid of fire
is such a failure.
No. It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Believe me. Your parents won't blame you
It's all in the past .
They will watch over you from above.
Thank you.
Father.
Mother.
Where are you?
My son. What nonsense are you saying?
Father, I understand now.
You forced me into a marriage because you were afraid
I would go wrong because of my age.
Father, do not worry. I will not rebel against you again.
I will never rebel against you again.
My child. It is all right.
I have thought about it,
and you are right.
Marriage is an important event in your life, and
I should never have forced you.
I have been waiting for you for so long
to say this to you.
I am sorry for that. I have now fulfilled my
last wish, and I have to go now.
I have never blamed you.
My child,
you must live well.
-Father!
 -My child!
Mother! Don't go!
Don't leave me behind alone! Father! Mother!
Please don't go!
Father!
Mother!
Father!
Father!
Leave the past in the past.
Let's start anew.
 Don't worry about me.
I am going back to Lang Ya Yi for a while.
Father. Mother.

Did you really visited me last night?
Or was it only a dream?
How come you are here?
It was not your fault and your parents
have already forgiven you.
Why can't you forgive yourself?
Not that I can't forgive myself,
it's...
It was not your fault.
I know you are trying to make me feel better.
It was not your fault.
There are just some things that I can never forget.
Look at me. Look at me.
I really can't forget.
Really can't forget.
It was not your fault, don't you know?
Let me explain.
Listen to me. It was not your fault.
It really was not your fault,
don't you know?
No.
It was not your fault.
Tired?
Let me soak your feet for a while. You'll feel better.
I'll do it myself.
Just let me do what a wife should do.
Later, I'll make you your favorite hometown dishes,
and have dinner with you together.
What's up with you today?
You're a bit strange today.
I haven't done enough for you before,
so I want to be a better wife to you in the future.
No, Pei Rong, don't say that.
You have been great.
We've been married for so long,
but I didn't know that you are still sad about the past.
I haven't been able to comfort you.
You know about that already?
I'm sorry.
I should have realized earlier.
It's all right. It's all in the past now.
Let's not talk about this.
Actually this time, I'm grateful to Xiao Wei.
She has been encouraging me.
How does she know how you feel?
Her parents were killed by the Tsar bandits too.
We have similar experiences in that.
That's why she understands my feelings, I guess.
I'm sorry.
I have spent so much time in the Exquisite Salon that
I had no time to consider how you felt.
I have been a really bad wife.
Pei Rong, stop saying that.
Pei Rong, in my heart you have been the best wife.
In fact, I have been lacking.
I have spent too much time on the Training Ground and had no time for you.
So please believe me, in the future,
I will try to spend more time with you, okay?
It's a deal then.
In future, if you have a problem, tell me.
 Don't keep it to yourself.
Okay?
Okay.
Miss, goodbye.
Please come again soon.
That lady normally only window-shops,
but she has bought so much today.
Xiao Wei, you are really good.
It wasn't me. I think she was in a good mood today.
Xiao Wei, if you come to the store everyday,
I'm sure business will surely improve.
No. If you do that,
we can't let you do that for nothing. We'll pay you.
No need for that. Pei Rong is now my sister.
I should help her, or else I'll just be sponging off her.
But this...
It's fine.
You two stop treating me like a stranger.
Okay then.
Oh right, Sister Lin Lin,
come look at our new stock.
Really? Let me see.
And these?
It's better than the previous one.
What are you doing here? Go!
Leave quickly!
Xiao Wei.
What are you doing?
There is a bug.
I'll go get a rag to wipe it.
Wow.
Xiao Wei is not even afraid of bugs.
 Having her around is great.
How can you be so low?
How am I low?
I just think that it's good to have
another person to use.
Don't treat Xiao Wei like that.
I...
Pei Rong, you're too soft-hearted.
Something has been troubling you the whole day.
What is it?
I feel like hiring another person.
Why? Our business has only just started to improve.
If you hire another person now, it's not cost effective.
I agree.
I get it. Are you trying to make more time for Brother Sheng?
Yes.
I have spent so much time
and effort on the store
that I have ignored his feelings.
So now, I would like to spend more time at home.
Has Brother Wang complained to you?
Or are you taking our advice to take precautions against her?
That's not it. I just want to be a better wife.
From what I am seeing,
you are already a good wife.
You are not somebody's wife,
 so you won't understand.
Men, secretly, all want a virtuous woman as a wife,
And a demon as a lover.
Does that mean Xiao Wei is a demon?
I don't mean that.
Anyway, the fact that Xiao Wei has helped Brother Wang overcome his fear of fire
means that she is not as innocent as she looks.
Yes, if the man I love
shares his problems with another woman,
I would be very angry.
But he has explained everything to me.
Doesn't this prove that they are innocent?
That sounds right too.
-You really have no backbone!
 -What?
All right, that's enough.
You two should help me think of a way
to make Brother Sheng happier.
This...
-Isn't it Brother Wang's birthday soon?
-Yes.
Let's throw him a party to lift his spirits.
Great!
It'll bring you two closer.
Also, it'll show Xiao Wei who's the boss here.
The best part is the good food we can eat.
One event, three benefits!
Then...
Then what? It's settled then.
So they want to plan a birthday party for Wang Sheng.
Fine. I can experience what a birthday party is.
How about I kill a few people for you that night
so Wang Sheng can't attend the party?
Mind your own business.
I want to you stay in your hole that night.
I want them to have the most
unforgettable birthday party.
Also, I want to attend the party at my best.
So you know what to do.
Yes.
Come on.
Just follow me.
Where are you rushing us to?
Brother Sheng, just follow me.
You'll know when we get there.
-What is it? Why must we go to my house to talk?
-Just come. You'll know soon.
Gao Xiang!
What's so urgent? Tell me quick.
There's been an emergency.
What is it? Tell me, Gao Xiang.
Brother Sheng, happy birthday!
May your happiness be as immense as the East Sea.
Live as long as Mt Nan!
Talk. Whose idea is this?
It's mine.
Brother Sheng, happy birthday.
Pei Rong, since when have you become so devious?
A lot of sad things have happened lately
and since it's also your birthday,
I wanted to make you happier.
But, there's a rule in my old village.
That is...a married man who is not 60 cannot celebrate his birthday.
If he does, there will be a third party in their marriage.
Is that true?
Of course not!
Dont' say such nonsense next time.
Aren't you the same?
Gao Xiang telling me there's been an emergency has scared me to death.
Brother Sheng. For your birthday,
I have especially sewn you an outfit
as a birthday present.
Pei Rong, you are really considerate of me.
Thank you.
Wow. I'm really envious of your love.
Not only envious, you make us jealous too.
Brother Sheng.
I haven't had enough time to prepare a really good gift.
I know that your chisel has broken.
So, I bought you a new one.
Xiao Wei, this is a really fine chisel.
I like it very much. Thank you.
It's good as long as you like it.
How come there's another one in there?
This is for myself.
For yourself?
It's actually my birthday too
so I bought myself something.,
Today is your birthday too?
Why didn't you say so earlier?
This is such a coincidence.
Xiao Wei, why didn't you say so earlier
so we could prepare something for you too?
I thought it was too much of a coincidence too.
I didn't think you would believe me.
What is there to not believe?
Why would there be a fake birthday?
Yes.
Xiao Wei, I didn't know it was your birthday too
so I didn't get you a present.
Pei Rong, what should we do?
Ah...
This jade has been with me always.
Take this as a present.
I can't accept this. It's too valuable.
No. Don't reject this.
This is for you. Keep it.
Thank you.
What a coincidence.
Let's help Sister Pei Rong.
Xiao Wei, let me give you a toast.
I hope you'll find your other half soon.
I am not looking for one yet.
As the saying goes, a man should marry a wife and a woman a husband.
This is a way of life.
-That's right.
 -A fine woman like you
-will marry well. Isn't that right?
-Yes. Yes.
Brother Wang, as Xiao Wei's adopted brother-in-law,
should you plan for her happiness as well?
Of course.
Sister Pei Rong, don't you agree?
Yes. Of course I wish Xiao Wei would find her happiness.
As this is a matter of Xiao Wei's future happiness,
let's discuss this again another time.
Come.
Bring wine here.
Let's have a toast. For Xiao Wei's birthday.
Cheers!
It's late. Am I disturbing you?
No.
Have a seat.
Is something the matter?
I have something to ask you.
What is it?
Brother Sheng and I have discussed it.
We want to find you a good family.
What's wrong? Are you unwilling?
It's not that.
Sister Pei Rong,
did I do something wrong,
 and you want me to leave?
Don't get me wrong.
You haven't done anything wrong.
We were thinking of your happiness.
Forget I said anything.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
Elder sister,
thank you for both your concern.
I shall do what you both have planned.
-Queue behind me.
 -Don't rush.
Don't cut queue. Get to the back.
Let's go.
Jing An, I'm your Elder brother.
So?
I usually let you have your way but not this time.
I...You...
Jing Ping. Jing An. Haven't you got something going on at home?
Why are you here?
I thought you two were sick,
but here you are.
Let's not fight since our goal is the same.
That's right.
But let me make this clear.
No matter who becomes Xiao Wei's husband
the others can't get mad.
We are still brothers in the future.
Of course.
Get in line.
We were here first.
Don't rush. Don't rush.
-Don't rush.
-I was here first.
I was here first.
I can't believe we used Xiao Wei's marriage.
Yes. I think all of the village's bachelors are here.
How can the few of us deal with this?
Are they mistaken?
Is Xiao Wei really that popular?
Are you envious?
Shall we plan one for you too?
No need. I hate men who only like physical appearances.
I think she's afraid Xiao Wei will steal her limelight.
I'll give you 10 teals. Let me through.
What's going on?
Our family has money, so let me go in first.
Jing Ping. Jing An.
-Don't pull my pants.
-What are you talking about?
 -What are you doing? Let me through.
-Husband.
-Brother Sheng, how come you're here?
I was wondering why there's a crowd here,
so I came over to take a look.
What's happening?
It's good you're here.
There're so many people here I don't know how to select.
 Help me select.
Select what?
Didn't we agree to select a good husband for Xiao Wei?
Okay. Okay.
What advantage do you think you have?
I think I'm super good-looking.
-He's good looking?
-Really?!
Why do you think you'll win out of all the candidates?
I have money,
So what if you have money?
You have more than one merit, haven't you?
Of course. I'm perfect.
One, I am wealthy.
Two, I am cool.
Don't these two points mean perfection?
You all are too bold.
You missed training to come here.
Brother Sheng, I really like Miss Xiao Wei.
I can't just watch her marry someone else. I had to try.
Or I'd regret for the rest of my life.
That's right, Brother Sheng.
We are willing to accept whatever punishment you give us.
Jing Ping, but I know
that you are usually lazy.
And Jing An, you love gambling too much.
How can I give Xiao Wei to you without any worry?
And you...you love gambling too.
And you. You love drinking.
You. You are very bad tempered.
You have very weak martial arts skills.
Having weak martial arts is out too?
Of course.
Weak martial arts skills gets you killed too easily on the battleground
and Xiao Wei will become a widow.
Then I...
Any more questions?
No? Then back to the Training Grounds quickly.
Yes. Yes.
Pei Rong.
-Brother Sheng.
-I'll go back too.
-Okay.
Brother Sheng, what do you think?
Any suitable candidate?
None at all.
I saw one I think isn't bad.
I am Yuan Ren. Respect to you, General.
What do you do?
My family has a Herbal Shop in Ling Xian.
You have seen the other candidates.
Wealthy and respectable people.
What merits have you got that
I would let Xiao Wei marry you?
I may not be wealthy,
but we have branches in the Capital and in Ge Xian.
Miss Xiao Wei will not lack anything in life.
What I hate most is
a person who isn't learned or skilled
just because their family is wealthy.
My view is the same as yours, General.
So what if our views are the same?
Yuan Ren has just successfully become
a candidate in the Imperial Examinations.
He plans to take the Imperial Examinations in the Capital next year.
