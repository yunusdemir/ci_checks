What are you looking at?
What grade are you in?
Third.
At the De Amicis school?
Not De AmEEcis!
It's called De Amicis!
It's really pronounced
De AmEEcis.
It's De Amicis.
What's that in your ear?
Ain't you got nothin'
better to do?
Sorry, there's no chocolate.
What <i>is</i> there?
There's vanilla, pistachio,
strawberry, coffee...
mint and lemon.
CouId I have a cappuccino,
please?
I'm waiting on someone.
I want chocoIate.
Let's see if there's some left.
Damn!
Son-of-a-bitch!
Come out of there!
You're a third grader, too?
Yes.
So you'll be my student.
I don't beIong to anybody.
Okay, if you prefer,
I'll be your teacher.
Oh, the new one.
You've also got an earring,
I see.
But isn't that what girls wear?
On the right.
Guys wear it on the left.
Ah... guys.
Vincenzino, tell me
what it's like in Corzano.
Corzano?
Just Iook around you.
The streets are all busted.
The houses are smashed
from the earthquake.
All there is is garbage
and junkies' needles.
Every Sunday,
you know what my father says?
"What the hell are we doing
in this shit-hole?
Let's go to Naples."
So we dress up and go to Naples.
But when we come home,
it's still Corzano.
See those guys there?
They're all crooks.
They think they own Corzano.
So I tell 'em...
"Keep this town, and its alleys
and garbage!" Right?
Yes.
You know what else?
Talking of garbage,
every morning...
my classmate, Tommasina,
rolls in garbage before class.
Then she comes to school
and infects us with wigs.
Wigs?
Yeah, wigs... wigs!
Oh, lice!
Excuse me!
My suitcase!
You've made a mistake!
That's <i>my</i> suitcase!
Professor Sperelli!
I sent her.
She works for the rooming house.
Bring the professor's suitcase
to his room.
Take it upstairs.
The view is spectacuIar.
A nice, inexpensive room, right?
It's beautiful.
Anything you need...
just let us know.
You've brought that in. Good.
One small change, please.
Could we move the desk
to have it face the light?
- Cecchina, come here.
- I'll heIp.
Let's move the desk
so that it faces the light.
Careful. There.
Near the wall.
One moment. There.
That's it.
I'm sorry. It's a little heavy.
This way--
The bed.
He's too big to pass through.
We'll move the bed.
And the bookcase?
The bed'll go here,
the bookcase there.
But then his feet--
lt's bad Iuck!
My feet?
Bad luck!
Are you a little...
Please,
don't let the girl think that.
I've been divorced for years.
But how did you know about that?
About what?
My wife running off
with the dentist.
Oh, God!
I didn't mean about your wife.
You didn't?
This was for the evil eye,
not your wife.
Are you superstitious?
No, not at all.
In Naples, if you sleep with
your feet toward the door...
it means you'll Ieave--
Feet first.
Feet first?
Like in a coffin.
I see. I haven't learned
all the local customs yet.
Michele,
did you bring the mozzarella?
I don't understand
what she said.
It's Aunt Esterina.
She's in perfect health.
She just gets
a littIe foggy sometimes.
Foggy...
Ah, Aunt Esterina,
he's not Michele.
What do you mean
he's not Michele?
Michele, what are you
supposed to bring to your wife?
Mozzarella.
Mozzarella.
Good boy! Mozzarella!
Don't forget.
She's always dramatizing,
Aunt Esterina.
Michele is dead.
He dropped dead 15 years ago.
Michele's dead.
Get that into your head!
Do I have to take your clothes off from your laggage?
I didn't understand, sorry.
Do I have to take your clothes off from your laggage?
No, thank you, I'll do it. You can go now.
Corzano!
Excuse me, kids.
Where's the principaI?
Come in, Mr. Sperelli.
I'm Mimi, the janitor.
The principal is out. It's not
absenteeism. She has lots to do.
It's politics.
Her husband's a councilman.
Sign here. Right here. Go on.
What is this?
It means you arrived today...
and are starting work
and all that. Sign.
But this paper is blank.
I'll fill it in later,
when there's time.
If you don't trust me,
don't sign. Who gives a shit!
Could you give me
an attendance book?
Sure! Soon as I find it.
I don't see it.
I understand.
Bring it to my class, please.
We got ourselves
a grouchy professor.
Look at that guy. What a nut!
This is the third grade.
Good morning, Maestro.
Good morning.
But there's nobody here.
You knew the teacher
was coming today, right?
Sure.
How many are in this class?
About fourteen, sixteen.
Fourteen, sixteen--
What's your name?
Rosinella.
What's your name?
I'm Marco Tulio Sperelli.
Excuse me. Who is responsibIe
for getting the kids to school?
Obviously not you.
I get it.
You stay here.
Don't leave the classroom.
- Let's go!
- What a pain!
- Where you goin'?
- For a brioche.
You'll get even fatter.
You're such a ball breaker.
We'll find those kids,
one by one.
- <i>We?</i>
- Yes. Come aIong.
Mimi, where are you going?
Where's my brioche?
Stay in the classroom.
Sure, but it's brioche time.
You see?
I have to take care of the kids.
You also sell brioches?
Why shouldn't I?
This one is used to
his morning brioche.
I have to think of the students.
I have a lot to do.
Don't waste my time,
Professor Sperelli.
I have
a responsible position here.
I have lots to do.
Excuse me.
Is she the cleaning lady?
Yes. She's also my wife.
- And she's working?
- Sure, she's working!
The principal is working,
you're working...
the cleaning woman works,
the kids work, everyone works.
And they say
in the South nobody works!
You all work frenetically here!
Who is he kidding?
Let's go. Time for school.
I'm working.
To school!
Let me go!
Don Muchè, this teacher stiff s
draggin' me off my gig!
You can't even speak properly.
You're coming to school.
Now, where do the others work?
There's the barber.
Vincenzino,
where the hell you going?
To school!
Moana's book rated every guy
who slept with her.
She said De Crescenzo
was the loudest.
Giuseppe Scarano?
- Come with me.
- I didn't do nothin'!
- Who are you?
- How dare you?
He's lathering me up.
Where are you taking him?
Have you heard of
compulsory schooling?
Or of child labor laws?
Don't interfere,
or I'll go to the mayor.
He <i>is</i> the mayor.
Wait. The man
is absolutely right.
With closed eyes, I didn't
realize a minor lathered me up.
Shame on you
for making a boy work.
You're the new teacher
from up north, right?
I'm Antonio Ruoppolo,
Mayor of Corzano.
Are you a third grader
at De Amicis school?
- Let's go to school.
- I can't! I can't!
Marlboro, Merit, Marlboro.
Who smokes?
Marlboro, Merit, Marlboro.
Who smokes?
Let's go. Business is closed.
Off to school.
Let me go!
No stories!
To school, I said!
Let me go!
I don't give a fuck
about school.
I got a responsibllity. I work!
Work? You call that work? Black
market cigarettes aren't work!
- He smuggles.
- Fuck you. Spies!
Off to school.
Buy tangerines!
Who's this new teacher? Him?
You should be glad
to go to school.
You call that a school?
It's disgusting!
It's old, broken down,
with holes in the walls.
Careful. Stop.
I'll let you pass.
Those guys will run you over.
Let's go over here.
The boys pee in the sink...
and clog up the toilets.
The principal won't go in there.
Ah, of course.
She don't give a shit.
Hey, guys, everyone knows the
real boss is Mimi, the janitor.
Yes! He's really in charge.
He's a rotten son of a con man.
He's a Mafioso...
and everyone's afraid of him.
Our school is hell.
It's called "Filthy De Amicis."
Poor De Amicis... filthy?
De Amicis was a great educator,
a writer. He wrote "The Heart."
Let's go to school.
Let's go study.
Let's go. Here's the school.
Come here!
Toto, come here!
I'll catch you!
Why are you laughing?
Let's go to school. Come on.
You all have an earring, I see.
-Did you copy from Maradona?
-Maradona did copy from us.
-Don't insult Maradona. He's the best ever.
-Not at all.
-He's a bad guy. He's a junky.
-I'm gonna break your face!
Stop! Stop!
You go in the corner, you in
that corner and face the wall.
You're starting off shamefully.
What are you doing?
I'm eating.
You ate a brioche an hour ago.
It's time
for the second brioche.
A <i>second</i> brioche!
Put it away!
You should never overeat.
Or you'll end up like him
and like the teacher.
Look at the nails. Disgusting!
Let's see them.
Rule number two:
Come to class with...
clean nails.
Now...
who knows this man behind me?
- That man is a caveman, right?
- Exactly.
If I lived in the Stone Age,
I could club people.
They clubbed people?
Sure. They'd meet people
on the street, didn't say hello.
Just pow, pow!
And they'd beat them.
In those days, families always
fought and they were all dirty.
They didn't wash
or comb their hair or shave.
Even women didn't shave.
Do women shave now?
They shave their legs.
Even a newborn baby
was a caveman right away.
They didn't have
heat or television.
There was nothing
for them to do...
so they drew doodles
on the walls.
Doodles?
Yes, doodles.
What does that mean?
Scribbles. Nonsense.
Dirty pictures.
I get it: prehistoric graffiti.
Man started to be intelligent...
but he still looked
like a monkey.
When they stopped looking like
monkeys, they became Egyptians.
- Teacher, can I say something?
- Go ahead.
I can't tell the others.
Just you.
- Why?
- It's intimate and personal.
Intimate and personal.
Your nails are dirty, too.
But I won't tell anyone.
I promise.
Now go back to your seat.
Look at him sleeping.
School isn't for sleeping.
- What is his name?
- Gennaro.
Mr. Gennaro? Wake up!
You're in school,
facing your teacher.
Nice to meet you.
Stand up.
Go on out.
You'll keep standing
the rest of the day...
as punishment.
Go, if you have to.
What are <i>you</i> doing?
Oh, eating!
He's eating. Is it time
for the third brioche?
Go to the blackboard. Let's see
how much math you remember.
Hurry. Take the chalk.
We have to buy it from Mimi.
Chalk is school property.
Mimi, the janitor,
sells it for 500 lire.
It's true.
I toId you to go. Go on.
It's the big one.
What?
The big one! Number two!
She has to poop!
Then hurry up!
I haven't got the 50 lire
for toilet paper.
I'll come along.
You stay here
and behave yourselves.
-The usual five sheets?
-No. It's diarrhea. A flat rate.
12 sheets for 100, plus chalk,
comes to 600 lire...
but you're new,
so make it 500.
I'll pay 600.
No flat rate.
Help!
Let's go. Hurry!
We can make it.
We're almost there.
Here we are.
I'll wait out here.
Oh, God! Teacher!
My zipper broke!
I can't hoId it!
Wait. If you're not ashamed,
I'll help you. I won't look.
Who cares?
I'm shitting in my pants!
There.
What are you doing
to that girl?
I'm doing
what you should be doing.
Too late!
Wait. Damn! Now please
clean her up, at least.
Me?
Who else? Me?
But, Professor,
if Mimi, the janitor...
didn't sell toilet paper by the piece,
we'd be in deep trouble.
The State sends us nothing.
But you're perfectly right.
And thanks for
gathering the kids from work.
I can't do it every day.
Sure, but it set a good example.
Let's hope so.
About the toilet paper
and the chalk.
We'll write a nice letter to
the Board of Education and I'll sign it.
Actually, it's better
if you sign it.
You have guardian angels.
Excuse me. I don't really
understand what you're saying.
Professor... Professor...
there are at Ieast
500 Neapolitan teachers...
who'd kill to have
your job at De Amicis.
I'm at De Amicis, as you
call it, only by accident.
It was a bureaucratic error.
You understand?
My assignment was to be Corsano,
near my home, not Corzano.
Corzano, Corsano, with an "S."
I knew it.
It just means your guardian
angel made a small mistake.
But you <i>have</i> a guardian angel.
You go too far!
Relax, Sperelli.
Don't get bent out of shape.
You're all red.
What's the big deal?
I mustn't get upset. Do you want
me to have a premature birth?
Do you belong to the Republican Party?
Me? No! Who you think I am?
I'm sorry. That's professional deformation.
Because my husband is in politics.
There he is now.
My husband, the stud of Seville!
He's given me six kids
in ten years of marriage.
Now that's fertile!
Please assure my colleagues
who want my job...
that I've requested a transfer.
Within a month or six weeks...
I'll be happily back up north.
So, happily, Professor Sperelli.
You're just passing through
and you want to...
fix all the troubles
in the South in a few weeks...
starting with De Amicis?
Even <i>you</i> can't pronounce
De AmEEcis properly!
Who says so?
I do. Everyone does.
No, Sperelli.
Here we all say De Amicis.
Get used to it, Professor.
Try to fit in.
You want to change
too many things.
-Simple past of To go verb.
-I know this.
-He...
-He? Iss'h.
Don't tell me!
Damn! I burnt my shirt!
You could tell me.
I wanted to tell you but you
were like "Don't tell me" so
I didn't tell you.
-I'm trying to fix it.
-Is it bad?
-It's not that bad. If you want,
 I can sew it.
-No, thanks.
I'm trying to live by myself. Then
the burning goes to "that" zone.
How you call that?
-O'mazz.
-It goes to the "o'mazz".
I forgot! I wanted to give you
a surprise, professor.
Among the papers of the old professor,
I found some books about poetry
from Naples.
They are amazing. Look at this one.
Di Giacomo.
Oh, Salvatore Di Giacomo.
It's such a curious and amazing poetry.
For example, there is one about a poo.
You have to read it. It's very funny.
Even if you don't know Neapolitan.
Michele did forget Neapolitan?
Good day, Reverend.
Don Gabrielluccio,
why don't you turn around?
The view is so beautifuI.
There's the sea.
I've already seen it.
I understand.
<i>"Gennarino Esposito,</i>
<i>Composition.</i>
<i>"My house and discussions.</i>
<i>"My house is all cracked.</i>
<i>cracked ceilings...</i>
<i>"cracked walls...</i>
<i>"cracked floors.</i>
<i>"Sometimes I feel cracked, too.</i>
<i>My mother says."</i>
The Third World doesn't
even have cracked houses.
<i>"So we shouldn't complain.</i>
<i>"The Third World</i>
<i>is more Third than us.</i>
<i>"At Easter time, my father</i>
<i>brings home a lamb to slaughter.</i>
<i>"But we always feel sorry for it</i>
<i>and we end up keeping it.</i>
<i>And then my parents fight.</i>
<i>My mother says."</i>
Mother of God!
Another fucking lamb!
Every fucking year these lambs!
You never have the guts
to slaughter them!
I'll slaughter you!
<i>"My father is a junk man.</i>
<i>"Mornings he has another job.</i>
<i>He comes back in the afternoons.</i>
<i>"He sleeps a little, eats...</i>
<i>"and collects</i>
<i>cardboard boxes at night.</i>
<i>Many times I go along with him."</i>
That's why you sleep in class...
because you work at night.
Now I feel badly.
I scolded you
and made you stand up all day.
Don't worry.
I can also sleep standing up.
Why are you here?
Hello.
How much do you weigh?
What? Well--
Okay, I'll tell you.
I weigh 95 kilos.
And you?
I'm a mess, too... 51 kilos.
You need to be patient.
At my age, what were you like?
Me? Like this. Look.
Like that?
Exactly.
That's even worse
than Mama said.
What did Mama say?
If I keep eating like this,
I'll get fat like you.
Thanks.
That's really very encouraging.
Are you on any diet?
What kind of diet
do you mean?
The Jockey's Diet, Scarsdale,
Weight Watchers.
You're a regular diet expert!
More or less.
Do you diet?
No, because at home
we eat normal.
Really?
Pasta and beans
in octopus broth.
Octopus with olives and capers.
Meat soup, stew, vermicelli
with garlic and oil...
pork, innards, peas, eggs.
Pizza with meatballs
and sausage. Little pizzas.
Persimmons, pears, cherries,
dates and melons.
I'm getting hungry.
And for desert:
Baba, eclairs...
eclairs with
chocolate and cream...
pastries, elephant ears,
zeppole...
delicious Sicilian cannoli...
sfogliatelle,
struffoll and rococo!
That would be normal meals?
Yes, but not all in one day.
We'd have broken pipes.
You mean a broken esophagus.
At least you don't wear
an earring.
'Course I do!
Oh, God! I was ripped off.
Wait! Come here!
Wait. You look better
without the earring.
I'm talking as one
who knows about such things.
Aren't you coming?
- You're going to Toto's house?
- Yes, let's go.
What's wrong?
Toto thinks I'm your spy.
What do you mean, "spy"?
Do you all consider me
your enemy?
- Spy!
- Fuck your ancestors!
You see? Didn't I tell you?
Here's what we'll do.
Order yourself an ice cream...
and tell Vincenzino
the teacher's paying.
Isn't ice cream fattening?
We'll start dieting
another time.
Okay.
You're Toto's sister?
Where's your mother?
She's working.
- Your father?
- Over there.
Is he Ill?
No! He's drunk.
Who are you?
I'm the teacher.
And this is Toto's jacket.
Yes. Who knows
who he stole it from.
Exactly.
The milk... turn it off, please.
I must discuss this boy
with someone.
Talk to me.
To you? But--
I'm in charge here.
Could you pour the milk in the
bottle? Otherwise it cools off.
We-- This morning
Toto ran away from me...
left me holding his jacket
and didn't come to school.
You realize he's
a little too lively.
Lively? He's a delinquent,
a good-for-nothing!
- Do you mind?
- What?
Feed the baby.
Excuse me.
What a beauty!
Here, beauty.
But getting back to Toto...
I think he <i>must</i>
return to school...
above all to get him off
the street. You understand?
I don't want to undermine
your authority.
I know you're in charge.
But I wouId like to speak
with your father.
Right now my father's head
isn't working.
Don't worry. Tomorrow morning,
when he wakes up, I'll tell him.
What's wrong with the baby?
She's hungry.
Wait a minute.
What's her name?
Excuse me.
What's her name?
- Nanarella.
- Nanarella.
Your little sister-- Wait.
Be good.
Is her mama coming soon?
20,000 lire?
Nicola said, "The maestro is
paying." It was an open order.
I said I'd pay for him,
not for everyone.
Why should I be paying?
Should I be paying?
Who's the asshole buying ices
for the whole third grade?
I am.
Oh, sorry.
Enjoy it.
Let him go!
What happened?
Damn your ancestors!
What a mess!
Leave him alone, Salvatore.
You're a drunkard!
I'll fix you!
You ain't gonna be
a disgrace like me! Get it?
Get your ass in school!
You're always drunk! Always!
He won't be a disgrace
like me!
Did you drink some bad wine
this morning?
Get going, you disgrace!
Are you nuts? Leave the kid alone.
He's not a soccer ball.
Fuck off, junk man!
Lousy manners!
Get moving!
What d'you want?
A guy's gotta be a good father!
Fuck you!
Good morning.
I said good morning.
Sit down.
Why are you still standing?
Thanks to you, I can't sit.
Good job, Maestro!
You got his ass whipped!
They sent you from the North!
You busted balls
the moment you got here.
Quiet.
I don't like you.
But thanks to that whipping...
for the first time
I have an almost complete class.
What's your name?
Salvatore.
No. Tell me your last name.
Salvatore.
Salvatore isn't enough.
You must have a last name.
I don't remember my last name.
Gennaro's snoring.
Let him sleep.
He worked all night, poor kid.
I'm going back to work
tomorrow, too.
Me, too. We need the money.
You say schooI is mandatory.
They pay you to come to school.
But who pays us? Nobody!
My dad's out of work.
They're all mad at you.
I know. I know.
Go to your seat.
That's enough.
Let's start the lesson.
Do any of you live on a street
named after a famous person?
I live on the Via Garibaldi.
Garibaldi was
the hero of both worlds.
He doesn't live
on Via Garibaldi.
He's slinging shit!
He's slinging what?
He's lying.
He lives on Three Chicken Road.
Fine, but I want to hear
about Garibaldi anyway.
Toto!
You're here?
They kicked me all the way here.
We took on that job, damn it!
Don't blame me.
Come on, shithead, walk!
Who are you?
I'm Mister Raffaele Aiello.
Mark me present.
The truck's waiting. Move it!
You, stop. Stay there.
"Mark me present"?!
Come in and close the door.
You've got some nerve!
I'm talking intelligently
with one of my men...
and you're
crushing my cantaloupes.
What did he say?
You're smashing them--
-How do you explain cantaloupes?
-Balls!
How dare you? Get out!
I go when I want to go.
Out, you Illiterate!
You wouldn't dare.
You know, I spat
in the other teacher's face...
but I'll smash your face
into the wall!
I won't let you! You understand?
I'm sorry.
I don't know how
it couId have happened...
but his face was...
so full of hatred...
like an aduIt...
like a vuIgar delinquent, like--
Like a Mafioso.
That's for sure. This is the South,
not Switzerland.
Kids like that
force your hand.
I'm an educator.
All my life I've taught
the philosophy of nonviolence.
Now I've hit
an eight-year-old boy.
You must help me and report me
to the School Board.
You should have me expelled,
to set an example.
We'd have to report
every teacher...
every mother, every father...
grandparents, uncles,
one and all.
When I was young
and in school...
my teacher used to hit me.
My father smacked me...
and my mother whacked
all eight of us kids.
And I still turned out fine.
You turned out fine.
You turned out very badly.
I don't like you.
You know why?
Because your philosophy is
at the root of all that's wrong in here!
- You don't like me?
- No.
I like you even less!
You're an impotent,
presumptuous racist...
with friends in high places.
Oh, I'm a racist?
A racist. Underneath,
you're just a racist.
This is no place for you.
This is trench warfare.
It's a war here in the South.
These kids have brass balls!
And the teachers
should also have them.
That slap was the best thing
you've done since you got here!
Now the class will respect you!
Did you like what I did?
The teacher
has earned your respect.
But how? By slapping
one of your classmates.
You see, you now admire me...
for something for which
you should not respect me.
Because respect
gained by force...
today with a slap
and tomorrow...
with a revolver or a
machine gun, that's not respect.
It's shame.
And it may be the cause
of all the trouble in the South.
Violence is shameful
in a civilized being...
especially in a teacher.
I'm going home.
I don't feel well.
Anyway, I'm only here temporarily.
I don't expect to be well
until I receive my transfer.
Good luck.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Here you are this half cigar.
Take it easy. You'll choke.
-Can I smoke in peace?
-Smoke. Why I should give a shit?
-What's wrong with Michele?
-I said, he's not Michele.
Maybe he's not Michele, but he's still pissed.
Now we do a nice lesson of Neapolitan.
I guess you'll laugh a lot.
-No, thanks. Neapolitan doesn't interest
 me anymore.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
Have you really
decided to Ieave?
Yes.
The doorbell. Who could it be
at this hour? Excuse me.
Go ahead.
Michele...
excuse me.
Are you angry with me?
Certainly not.
I'm a little distracted.
It's your student's mother.
Should I throw her out?
Professor,
I'm Raffaele Aiello's mama.
I have to talk to that person.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Aiello?
Please, sit down.
Watch the baby.
Do you realize?
- What?
- In our house.
What?
He's bringing women
to his room!
I'm very sorry about
hitting your son this morning.
I'm 45 years oId.
My husband was crippled in a
shootout with customs offlcers.
I have four kids.
The oldest is called Rosario.
You know where he was
until last week?
At Filangeri.
The correctional institution.
But I was happier
knowing he was there...
because there
he wouldn't get shot.
Raffaele is the second...
and he's following
the same road.
When I heard...
that you picked up the kids
house to house...
I thanked the Holy Mother.
Now I hear
you're abandoning the school.
No, no. Absolutely no.
For me, you're the last hope.
I brought you a basket of eggs.
You think life is like this?
A step forward, a step back?
Life is a ball breaker, my dear.
Is he coming?
Go see. Run!
He said he won't come,
and he won't come.
- He's here!
- Sit and be quiet!
Good morning, Maestro.
Sit down.
As you see, I'm feeling better
and I've come back.
Let's forget
what happened yesterday.
But I see
that someone didn't forget.
I'm happy to see that
RaffaeIe is also in class today.
This object, which is meant...
as a vendetta against me...
is human excrement in a
cylindrical and squashed shape.
It is an important part
of the life cycIe...
just like butterflies,
flowers, twinkles and stars.
Feces...
have inspired many jokes
and amusing stories.
They've also inspired
famous writers and poets...
like Dante, Boccaccio
and other Neapolitan writers.
I'd like to read you
something from this book.
Listen to
these grandiose verses.
"Shit...
"On the street,
by the sun's ray lit...
"A fly sings you a lullaby...
"So sleep in peace...
Oh, noble shit."
Are you talking to me?
No.
<i>"To the Board of Education.</i>
<i>"I, Marco Tulio Sperelli...</i>
<i>"am hereby withdrawing</i>
<i>my request for a transfer.</i>
<i>"I wish to remain</i>
<i>in my current position...</i>
<i>"as third</i>-<i>grade instructor...</i>
<i>at De Amicis</i>
<i>in Corzano, Naples. "</i>
"Rain. My composition.
"If Jesus didn't send rain,
there would be problems.
"The plants would droop,
the trees wouId wilt...
"the earth would be parched,
animals wouId croak.
I'd croak and so would
everybody else."
A shit-load of dead stuff.
"Water is God's gift, but in Calabria
it doesn't rain in the season."
Which season?
- <i>The</i> season.
- There are four seasons.
Yes. Autumn, winter, spring
and the season.
You mean summer.
Why do you call it "the season"?
Because it's the nicest.
Not nasty like now.
You don't know whether to take
a walk outdoors or inside.
Winter's okay for the rich,
but for the poor, it's awful.
She doesn't give a fuck.
Her house has heat!
Is it my fault
that my father works...
and that I'm a material girl?
In the season, my father puts
his clothes in the fridge...
so they smell fresh.
Be brave, Nicola.
Off with the pants!
Have some pity!
Yesterday, did you really...
buy a stereo cassette pIayer
in Naples?
How did you know?
And instead of the stereo,
you found a brick in the box?
Two bricks.
They made a fool of you!
How could you let them?
Even the Japanese
don't fall for that!
Not even the Germans.
Not even the Milanese!
That's just about everyone.
Even the janitor?
Sit down.
- What'll you do?
- How do you mean?
You should get back at him!
Should I tell the police?
What would <i>you</i> do?
No, wait a minute.
Talk one at a time!
I'd say,
"I'll kick your whore mother!"
I'd tell that shithead,
"Fuck your dead ancestors!"
"Your old lady does it
with dogs!" I'd say.
I'd bang his head 50 times!
I'd stick it up his ass!
And up his mother's twat!
Oh, my God!
I'd crack his fat ass.
I'd grab him and say,
"Your mother is a fart jockey!"
- Enough!
- Then I'd sing:
"Your father's ass
smells like a zoo.
"Your sister's tits need glue.
"Sailors pay a buck
to give your mama a screw.
Cops like her, too.
Their balls turn blue."
Enough vulgarities.
We'll continue our lesson.
How many months are there
in each season?
January, February and March,
but not all, and December...
are winter months.
Some of March, Aprll, May
and some of June...
are spring months.
Some of June, July, August
and some of September...
are summer months,
and all the rest are autumn.
Which month you prefer, Lucetta?
I prefer January because the Epiphany comes, plus my birthday.
I prefer February because Carnival comes.
I prefer March because Spring comes.
I prefer April because Easter comes.
Nothing about May.
I prefer June because Summer comes.
I prefer July because I go on vacation.
Nothing about August.
I prefer September because the soccer season starts.
Nothing about October and November.
I like December because Christmas comes.
January is cold, February is cold,
March is crazy, April is hot, May is hot
June is hot, July is very hot, August
is very very hot, September is cool, October...
Professor, she'll talk forever!
It's ten after one!
Why didn't the bell ring?
Professor, I'm starving!
All right, put away your books.
- What are we waiting for?
- The bell.
- Where's the janitor?
- On the phone, as usual.
Is it raining?
A drizzle.
A drizzle.
Let's go before it starts
to pour.
Not before Mimi rings the bell.
It's 1:15. The kids are hungry.
ShouId I ring the bell?
You'll have to deal
with that maniac!
No problem.
Go ahead.
Go on. Leave.
Let's go, too.
Excuse me.
Stop! Stop! Where are you going?
Who dared do this?
Who rang the bell?
Come right back inside!
Nobody leaves this school
before I ring the bell.
I'm in charge. Who was it?
Who dared to ring the bell?
I did. So what?
Oh, yeah? I knew it, Professor!
This is <i>my</i> job.
You're the teacher. You teach!
Come on. Everybody inside!
He insulted you!
Call him a fart jockey!
Why didn't you
ring the bell on time?
Why? Because, that's why!
Inside, kid!
- Call him a fart jockey!
- Say it!
Enough clowning around.
Let's go.
You're making trouble!
Wait. Excuse me.
What's going on?
This man is upsetting
the discipline...
and he doesn't respect
my position.
Enough of this nonsense.
Madame Principal,
permit us to leave.
<i>You</i> stop the nonsense, Sperelli.
No Northerner is gonna
tell me what to do!
Call him a fart jockey!
Will you call him a fart jockey?
I'll teach this fart jockey
teacher a lesson!
You see?
He got you!
I goofed!
"SwitzerIand."
She wrote a composition
about Switzerland.
Her Uncle Pasquale
came from there.
"Switzerland faces Switzerland,
Italy, Germany...
"Switzerland and Austria.
"Switzerland sells weapons
to the whole world...
"so they can
kill each other off.
"But the Swiss won't even
fight a small war.
"They use that money
to build banks...
"but not good banks.
"Banks for bad guys
and for druggies.
"Sicilian and
Chinese delinquents...
"deposit millions in there.
"The police go and say,
'Whose money is this?'
"The bank says:
'That's our fucking business.
The bank is closed!"'
"But it isn't closed.
"It's open.
"In Naples,
if you have cancer, you die.
"But if you go to Switzerland,
you die later or you might live.
"Their hospitals
are the most beautiful.
"Carpets, flowers,
polished stairs...
"not even one rat.
It's so expensive that only
crooks can afford to go there."
End of composition.
That composition's
really dangerous.
If the immigration people
hear it, they'll deport us.
This is her first Christmas.
She's beautiful.
- How's her fever?
- It's gone.
What did she have?
Nothing. A touch of measles.
What's your temperature?
102. Put it there, please.
What did that baby have?
A touch of measles.
Esterina, it's not carnival time.
It's New Year's Eve,
and the professor is sick.
Let's bring him chamomile tea,
and then we'll ceIebrate.
<i>"Tommasina Rocco.</i>
<i>Composition.'Being Sick.</i>
<i>"When I get sick, it's trouble</i>
<i>for the whole house.</i>
<i>The doctor who visits me</i>

Let's hope the turd

<i>"'Let's hope the turd</i>

<i>"But he doesn't know</i>
<i>and gives me the wrong medicine.</i>
<i>"Often he mistakes</i>

To the souls

I should spit
in Dr. Nicolella's face!

Very good, Tommasina!
Dr. Nicolella. Dear God!
I'm sorry to call you so late.
A high fever.
It's probably
a touch of the measles.
Good evening.
- You're Doctor--
- Nicolella, at your service.
What happened?
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Call Giovanni. Tell him they
arrested me. I need a lawyer.
Damn it!
That's my brother, assholes!
Buy mimosas! It's March 8!
Let me have four more, please.
Four more.
For Lucietta...
for Flora...
Tommasina...
Rosinella.
Thank you.
I brought these to celebrate
March 8, Ladies' Day.
You're whistling? You know
why we celebrate Ladies' Day?
I think women shouId be
equal to men.
Otherwise it's not fair.
They're equal on March 8.
Only on March 8?
No, not you!
Today you and I are dieting.
We'll eat again
tomorrow afternoon. All right?
Mother of God!
Be brave.
Please, one at a time.
Take it easy.
Salvatore, at least today,
tell me your last name.
Salvatore.
Not your first name.
Tell me your last name.
I've been asking you
for four months--
Where's the last pastry?
- Huh?
- No "Huh"!
Put it back.
Confiscated!
Nobody gets it now.
Back to your seats.
Let's talk a little more
seriously about Ladies' Day.
The womans day is also the mothers day?
-The mother in my family is a seriuos
 matter. She's more than a woman.
-What do you mean?
-She's a mammal.
-What?
-A mammal. Thats why she's called mamma.
So lets' talk about this mammal.
When we are babies she produces milk.
When we grow up she quits, but if
another baby comes she starts again.
So according to you all boils
down to a big dairy.
My mama doesn't produce milk. She doesn't
make up, doesn't go to the hairdresser.
She cuts her hair at home.
My neighbour comes to cut her hair.
And when she wants to keep apart with dad
she wears her best cloth.
Oh mama mama mama
-Do you know why my heart is beating?
 I've seen Maradona.
-Stop!
You bring women flowers,
but you don't like women.
I don't?
You're unmarried.
You have no chlldren.
So, you must be a faggot.
What?
Faggot!
He's no faggot.
How dare you!
Why get mad?
What's the big deal?
My uncle in NapIes is a fag.
He's very nice.
I'm sure he is.
I'm straight,
and I am married.
Oh, you see? He's married.
And where's your wife?
My wife left.
Sure, because you're a faggot!
No, because we're divorced.
She had a problem.
She always wanted to be right.
Let's drop the subject...
and get back to our lesson.
You have two hours
to write your answers.
Now...
A woman...
Are you writing this?
...goes to the market.
She has 10,000 lire.
- You're flnished already?
- Yes.
Can I ask you an intimate
and confidential question?
Certainly.
If someone is divorced,
can he remarry?
Yes.
All right, the two hours are up.
Please turn in
your exercise books.
Recess time.
Don't get the wrong idea.
Let's split it and not tell.
That's Raffaele on the scooter.
Look how reckless!
Raffaele!
Stop being reckless!
Raffaele, riding a horse--
Are you idiots? When he's killed
himself, will you be happy?
Whose bike?
His jailbird brother owned it.
He'd mug people with it.
What a delinquent. A bike,
muggings, drugs, jail, cemetery!
A great career!
Why is it that in Naples lately,
that's all you ever see on TV?
Once I watched
a Madonna concert.
Then the TV broke,
and I never got to see it.
Thinking about it
makes me crazy.
I don't mean TV shows.
I mean news programs.
My father aIways watches
dinnertime news.
Pasta, trouble!
Dessert, trouble!
When my father sees
the word "Naples," he says...
"Be quiet. Let's see
what new trouble there is.
Because they write 'Naples'
just to tell us about troubles."
What you call troubles is peopIe
getting killed on the street.
We in Corzano are better off.
We only have 8 deaths a year.
Well, then we can rest easy.
My grandma lives in Salvatore.
It's like a war zone there.
They'll kill you
for anything there.
Why do you think
these things happen?
The Mafia and drugs!
Ah, the Mafia and drugs.
It's a painful subject,
but let's talk about it.
What do you know about drugs?
First it makes you happy.
Then you become an idiot.
One gram costs 10 million.
But all druggies are poor,
so they steal...
and mug people...
and kill their parents.
You see lots of rainbow-colored
butterflies...
and you want to fly.
Then it's gone,
and you only see Corzano.
What's going on? The motorbike
broke. Please stop.
Hold it! I said stop!
Well, what happened?
I'm out of gas.
Will the bike fit on the roof?
Sure.
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Or are you ashamed
to ride with us?
I had business in NapIes.
It's okay.
Queen Maria Carolina was
the sister of Marie Antoinette.
You remember
Marie Antoinette?
The one in
the French RevoIution.
They chopped off her head.
- They were right!
- They were jeaIous, like you.
You think the French RevoIution
was caused only by jealousy?
And because Queen Marie
Antoinette had a good life.
She got up at five past noon...
had breakfast
with cappuccino and cake...
washed her face,
nails and the bidet...
and bought loads
of dresses and jewelry.
So people got mad.
She got on all their nerves.
So they started
the French Revolution.
They pummeled each other
and spat in each others' faces.
Then they invented
the guillotine...
and chopped off
everyone's head.
Chop, chop, chop!
I know everyone says
it's wrong...
but it's right:
men are not equal.
Some are handsome, some ugly,
some tall, some short.
Some are smart; some are dopes.
There's real men and shitheads.
And there are
different nationalities.
For instance,
I hate the Germans...
'cause they're always
starting wars.
I hate the British...
because they think
they're better than anybody.
I hate the French...
because they're always making
wine wars against us.
So you hate
just about everybody.
I only like Italy.
Actually, just half of it.
I hate Northerners because
they treat us like animals.
Yes, like animals.
If someone drops
a piece of paper in Milan...
they say he's from Naples,
without <i>knowing</i> if he is.
I know he's from Naples,
but how do <i>they</i> know?
Now, my dear Neapolitans...
you'll pick up
all the litter and cans.
Otherwise I'll hate you all.
You drop it off in the trash.
Then we all agree.
During the Easter vacation,
I want you each to...
write a composition about
any parable you choose.
Raffaele, come here.
- Why don't you write one too?
- No.
Go on...
just to see how you write.
Ya got here
and now you're in my face.
I don't understand.
That's Arabic.
You're being too pushy.
He should write about
the parable of the lost sheep.
Shithead!
Write about lost sheep yasself.
I didn't even want
to come along!
Enough! Let's go.
Damn it to hell!
Look at this.
His gasoline leaked all over!
The little bastard!
You said you were out of gas!
Just look! A broken gas cap!
He didn't really want to
come along. He ran out of fuel.
The lost sheep!
You should have come with us.
Why be ashamed of that?
Let me go!
Stop it!
You gonna slap me again?
- Raffaele!
- You'll pay for this!
Where are you going?
Is Moses' Ark a parable?
It's Noah's Ark, dummy!
He embraced that mummy and said:
"Lazarus, I forgive you
this time...
but if you die again,
I'll beat you up."
Good for Lazarus!
Happy Easter, Maestro.
Professor Sperelli,
a letter for you.
Good evening, Professor.
Did you all enjoy yourselves?
Weren't you sick today?
You should have come aIong.
I was money sick.
Papa doesn't have any.
But...
why didn't you tell me?
I'd have given it to you.
It's okay. Next time.
All right, next time.
When I'm big,
I want to earn piles of money.
So do I.
My papa says without dough,
you can't do anything.
And then he makes
a disgusting face at himself...
in the mirror.
And I know that he wants
to spit at himseIf.
And I feel sorry.
You shouldn't feel bad about
your father. He's a good man.
See you tomorrow.
So long.
A beautiful evening.
I see that you, too,
are enjoying...
your wall.
I received a letter today.
Some bad news
about my future here.
It's made me sad.
Well, that's life.
I shouIdn't take it so hard.
"At least there's the sun,"
as Neapolitans say.
We also say...
"Life is like the ladder
in a chicken coop.
Short and shitty."
I understand.
Too bad. My day started great.
The trip to Neaples with my kids.
We visited the royal palace in Caserta.
We saw the fountains.
You know that Neaples is beautiful.
Excuse the rhetoric, sometimes it
looks like a beautiful queen,
with her body lying by the sea.
Gutted and with her bowels out.
Seeing Neaples is like watching an autopsy.
I understand.
Fine.
Thank you...
for your comforting words.
I'm going to sleep.
Maestro!
Maestro, it's Raffaele Aiello.
My mama's sick. If she's not in
the hospital soon, she'll die!
We'll have to call an ambulance.
Come on.
What is it?
Excuse me for disturbing you.
One of my pupils' mother is sick.
Can I call an ambulance?
I keep the hospital's number
here in case of emergencies.
- Here it is.
- Thank you.
Calling the hospital
is pointless! They won't come.
Be quiet. Let me do it.
They're in cahoots
with the Mafia.
Hello, hospital?
We need an ambulance.
It's a matter of life and death!
He's sick?
In Corzano.
What do you mean
there aren't any?
- Call a private ambulance?
- Forget it. They cost millions.
Excuse me. How much would that
come to, more or less?
What?
A million or two!
- Forget it.
- You're disgusting!
Taking advantage
of people's pain!
You're in cahoots with
the Mafia! I'll report you.
They hung up.
Naturally they hung up.
Let's get going!
I'll come with you.
Excuse me.
- We'll take my car.
- We can't.
- Why not?
- I punctured your tires.
What?
I punctured your tires,
and I put sugar in the gas tank.
- Sugar?
- It fucks up the engine.
Damn it! Why?
Explain that to me!
For revenge. Remember how
you made me look like shit?
Or did you forget?
Come on.
Now you don't want to help me!
I knew it! Fuck you!
Wait. I'm coming with you.
Wait!
I do want to help you.
How do we take her there?
I'll pinch a car,
and you'll drive.
Pinch a car?
I steal it, and you drive.
Okay.
Oh, damn! I'm not insured.
Let's go!
Forget about that one.
- Why?
- I'll explain later. Come on!
- Look at those.
- These here?
Not so loud! We're stealing!
Sorry. I'm new at this.
Damn, they're all locked.
Raffaele, I'll look over there.
Raffaele.
I'll steal this one.
Let's steal this.
It's convenient
and has a stick shift.
What the fuck?
You wanna steal Half Ear's van?
- What's going on?
- Yes. I can explain it to you.
Raffaele.
We were lucky.
Half Ear is a friend.
You see? There still are
some good people around.
Sure. He's a black marketeer.
Sorry, Mrs. Annunziata.
This road's very bumpy.
Never mind, Half Ear.
I'm so grateful to you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you all.
Help me.
Take the cigar box
from under her head.
This cigarette carton is softer.
She'll be more comfortabIe.
I ruined your car,
and you're not even mad.
Revenge for what?
What did I do to you?
Before, they used to respect me.
You made me lose face
in front of everybody.
I did?
You want to ruin my life
and change me.
You want me to be like you.
But I want to be a man.
I don't wanna care for anybody.
Listen, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
There's a sick woman.
Please get a stretcher.
Wait. An orderly
wllI be coming.
A good-looking girI--
Mama's in bad shape.
Where are the orderlies?
- They're busy.
- Busy.
What do you mean, busy?
Can't you call them, please?
I'll call them.
Hey, asshole, get a stretcher
now, or I'll slaughter you!
- But I'm a nurse.
- Now you're an orderly!
All right.
You don't have to get excited.
Don't worry. 90% is a renal colic.
-90%, and the other 10?
-Fine. 95%.
She's in pain!
The nurse will give her a shot.
Can't you see the problems
we have here? Be patient!
The nurse will come
to give her a shot.
Nurses?
They fuck all night long!
They fuck?
They fuck, fuck, fuck.
And they don't give a fuck.
This pIace is filthy.
There are roaches in the beds,
but the raghead is the worst.
What?
The raghead. The nun.
The sister.
When she walks,
everybody trembles.
If I met her on the street,
I'd run her over.
Here you're better off dead.
Mama! Mama!
Where's her shot?
Hold on, kid.
How dare you!
If Half Ear were here,
she'd already have her shot.
What's going on? Quiet!
Why's this kid here? Out! Scram!
Ugly, bratty bitch!
Give this woman a shot now!
Or will you wait until she dies?
You ugly raghead!
All right, calm down!
You're crazy!
Get that injection ready.
- I'm sorry.
- You were better than Half Ear.
How is she?
Don't worry.
The worst is over.
Please.
Go haul ass an git th' 6:15.
Aunt's cumin'.
You understand?
Not a word.
You'd better leave,
or you'll miss the 6:15 bus.
My aunt is coming.
Okay, but when
your mother wakes up...
tell her I owe her
a basket of eggs.
How come?
She gave them to me
so I'd get you back to school...
and off the streets.
But now I won't be able
to earn them.
I'm being transferred.
I'm going back up north.
Jesus! For real?
Jesus. For real.
Although you don't want
to admit it...
you were
beginning to change.
Me? You got some nerve!
<i>You're</i> changing!
How?
You stole a van.
You smacked a nun
against a wall.
Two more weeks with me,
and you'd learn how to live.
Then it's really time
for me to leave.
Look here.
- Two nice color photos.
- Can I sign it?
Yes, you should all sign it.
And write a lot.
Thank you. Staying with you
was like being at home.
Professor...
if you get lonely
among those mountains...
come back here.
Okay.
You'll marry Esterina, eh?
A good idea.
There's her husband's pension,
my pension, yours--
- We like you a lot.
- Teacher.
These are our compositions
about parables.
Read them on the train.
No, no.
Give them to the new teacher.
Please,
behave yourseIves with him.
For Easter, send me a postcard.
You know the address.
Sure. We have to send you
the car with a new engine.
It'll be ready in 15 days.
I'll never forget you,
not even when you're dead.
Teacher, can I write to you?
Yes, but in
your best handwriting.
If I write, will you answer?
Yes.
You promise?
I promise.
Teacher.
Salvatore...
Sco-gna-mi-glio.
Very good!
Professor, this is for you.
It's a man's earring.
It's made of gold!
We all chipped in.
Except Tommasina.
But I--
I'll wear it now, okay?
No?
The left!
The right's for...
faggots!
Oh, yes.
Raffaele didn't come?
You can't leave
without seeing this beauty!
I haven't seen you
in school recently.
I've been on maternity leave.
- I know.
- Well?
Well--
Professor, you finally managed
to go back up north.
I did?
It's you who sent me away.
- We? No, you!
- You!
No, not us! You did!
You did. Anyway, good evening.
My regards
to the stud of Seville.
Same to your sister!
Well, my regards to that fart jockey who's your mama.
Good for you, Professor.
Have a good trip. Good-bye.
This is for you.
What's in here?
My composition. I tried.
Good for you.
School is bad, but you're not.
Michele, hurry back.
Please come back soon!
I'll come back,
and I'll bring mozzarella!
<i>Composition.'</i>
<i>My favorite parable...</i>
<i>is about the end of the world.</i>
<i>It doesn't scare me since I'll</i>
<i>already be dead a whole century.</i>
<i>God will divide everybody...</i>
<i>to the right and to the left.</i>
<i>Those in the center</i>
<i>will go to Purgatory.</i>
<i>There'll be millions... more</i>
<i>than there are Chinese people.</i>
<i>There will be three doors.'</i>
<i>A huge one for hell...</i>
<i>a medium one for Purgatory...</i>
<i>and a tiny one for Heaven.</i>
<i>Then God will say,</i>
<i>"Silence, all of you. "</i>
<i>And then he'll divide everyone.</i>
<i>One here, another one there.</i>
<i>If any smartasses</i>
<i>try to switch doors...</i>
<i>God will see them and say,</i>
<i>"Hey, where you goin'?"</i>
<i>The Earth will explode.</i>
<i>The stars will explode.</i>
<i>The sky will explode. Corzano</i>
<i>will be in a thousand pieces.</i>
<i>The good will laugh,</i>
<i>and the bad will cry.</i>
<i>Those in Purgatory will laugh</i>
<i>a little and cry a little.</i>
<i>The babies</i>
<i>will turn into butterflies.</i>
<i>Me, let's hope I make it.</i>
