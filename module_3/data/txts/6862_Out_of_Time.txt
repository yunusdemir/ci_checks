In St. Petersburg, Florida,
this 52-year-old man
Iets these two young women
into the house.
They lifted up their tops,
exposed themselves to the guy...
Chief Whitlock.
Chief Whitlock, it's Ann.
Ann Merai Harrison.
Somebody just
broke into my house.
All right. Be right over, ma'am.
How you doing, Miss Harrison?
Chief.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Mind if I come in?
- Come in.
- Thank you.
Oh, boy.
Did you get a good look
at this fellow?
Yeah.
He was about your height.
Your weight.
Come to think of it,
he kind of looked like you.
Looked like me?
So he was good-looking?
No.
Sorry. Just not my type.
So this "ugly" man-
you know how he got in the house?
The bedroom window.
It's all right
if I come in your bedroom?
Yeah. Come in.
Why don't you tell me
what happened?
Okay. I was asleep.
But then I woke up
'cause I felt something.
I saw the windowwas open...
...and he was standing
right where you are.
Right here?
You sure?
All right, so what did he do?
He came toward me.
He came toward you?
Like this?
Then he grabbed me.
- Where?
- Right here.
Like that?
But he was much stronger
than you.
Like that?
He forced himself
on top of me.
Like that?
His breath smelled like he'd been
drinking on the job, like yours.
- Really? What happened next?
- He kissed me.
Where?
Where, baby?
And he stripped me naked.
I was confused.
He ripped my shirt off.
You didn't put up
much of a fight, did you?
Oh, really? I didn't
put up much of a fight?
So you took control?
What did you do next?
What did you do, baby?
Watch me.
Tell me what you did next, baby.
Chief, you've got to get down
to the Scuttlebutt.
We've got a situation here.
It's about to blow.
Chief?
- Yeah, T ony, what's up?
- Where are you, Chief?
Can you get here?
We need you to come quick.
- Chief?
- Okay.
Look, T ony, I'm...
...coming now.
- No.
- I've got to go, baby.
I've got to go.
I've got to go to work.
So we'll pick up
on this crime tomorrow?
- Okay.
- What kind of crime?
- Assault with a deadly weapon.
- Breaking and entering.
See you later, baby.
- How y'all doing?
- Good, Chief.
Morning.
- Mathias Lee Whitlock.
- How you doing, Chris?
Having breakfast
with all your friends here?
I would invite you, Chris,
but I don't want to.
I'd sit down, but I don't want to.
- Did they find us a table?
- Yeah, we're in the back.
- Matt.
- How you doing, Ann?
Okay. I'm starving.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.
Hey, Chris, try the crab.
It's real good.
- I'm allergic.
- I know.
Right.
- How you doing, Sharlene?
- Hey, Chief.
- What time is it?
- It's 3:00.
3:00. Let's go.
Hey, man, you're
out of paper towels again.
- How you doing, Chae?
- Good.
Thought the camera
only added ten pounds.
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- Kind of, in a pudgy way.
I thought this might be
an opportune time
to revisit my offer
to invest in that business venture.
- Costa Rica?
- Chartered fishing boat.
- Steal the evidence money?
- You file a report on that yet?
- Is that it?
- That's it.
- 485 grand. Can I touch it?
- No, you can't.
- I just want to touch it.
- Get your hands out of there.
- Maybe I'll just steal it.
- Maybe I'll just shoot you.
Stop thinking like a cop.
Just listen to my proposition.
We'll take a grand out.
We'll go to the boat show.
We'll just walk around
with the money in our pocket,
get a sense of what it feels like
to knowwe could buy a boat.
- I'll see you in a minute.
- What do you think?
- Chae.
- Stranger.
- How you doing?
- How you doing, Alex?
I need your keys.
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
How about you?
Listen, I need your keys.
I left a couple of things.
- Okay. I'll go with you.
- No.
Why not?
I just want to go with you.
I don't want to get into anything.
I got a lot of work to do today.
- I know your work is important.
- Are you going to start with that?
I'm gonna go in the other room
and pretend to make a phone call.
- Congrats on making detective.
- Thanks, Chae.
Forget it.
Even if I left the Hope Diamond
in there, it's just not worth it.
- Bye, Matt.
- Good-bye, Alex.
Would you just give me
the goddamn keys?
They're on the desk
right in front of you.
I'll drop them off.
- See you.
- See you, sweetie.
She looks good.
Sometimes I think you
want me to shoot you.
Wait. Hold that thought.
Medical examiner.
Yeah. All right. What kind of prick
dies at cocktail hour on a Friday?
The nerve of some people.
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, see you.
Catch anything?
Trying to catch my self-respect.
Figuring out what it is I'm doing
in the middle of this...threesome.
Try foursome.
You're forgetting your wife.
She left me. I told her the other day-
told her today-come get her stuff.
How's the pro football quarterback?
He's up north
hunting for the weekend.
The whole weekend.
I got a splinter in my butt. You okay?
I'm okay. I'm definitely okay.
It's all right.
- You still love her.
- Huh?
You still love her, don't you?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, you do.
Will you divorce her?
- You still got your ring on.
- Chris needs me.
- Oh, okay.
- He does.
He's lost, been that way
since he got cut from the team.
I guess I feel sorry for him.
Remember that the next time
he goes upside your head.
Okay. Sure.
All right. I'll be right there.
- Ann Merai. Hi.
- Dr. Frieland.
- This is my brother Matt.
- Nice to meet you.
Sorry to bring you in today.
I was in surgery all day yesterday.
Please.
You can talk in front of him.
It's fine.
Right. Okay. Ann, I'm afraid
there's been a bit of a setback.
I had your tests back yesterday.
The cancer is not in remission.
It's come back very aggressively.
It's attacked your liver and lungs.
How long?
Well, that's difficult to say.
How long?
Five, six months.
No one can say for sure.
But I feel fine.
Listen...there's a counselor here
at the hospital I'd like you to see.
She's very good.
She'll help you during this period.
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.
Ann, wait.
Excuse me. Maybe you could
speak to her about the counseling?
Listen, you should be able
to do something, right?
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like "60 Minutes"?
I don't know. There are
alternative approaches.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
Let's see.
Autologous cancer vaccines,
hematology procedures,
hyperthermia treatments.
Here. Take a look at those.
They're extremely expensive,
and there are no guarantees.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me, baby?
I'm sorry.
When I was with you...
I forgot about it.
For a couple hours,
I didn't think about dying.
I understand.
You know, they've got
this alternative stuff.
There's a clinic in Switzerland-
I know. With my blood. I don't
put much stock in all that stuff.
They said there's a 17% chance,
a 17% success rate.
A whole 17%?
Odds are better I'd hit the lottery,
which is what I'd have to do
to afford something like that.
Listen. Where are you going?
I don't think we should
do this anymore.
It wasn't right for me
to drag you into this.
You didn't drag me into anything.
I'm a big boy.
Matt, I'm dying.
I'm dying.
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.
The girls at work were so jealous.
Glad to hear that.
That's not why you called me.
- What's up?
- I want to show you something.
- Chris didn't hit you again?
- No.
When we were married, we took out
insurance policies on each other,
but they were only
for $100,000.
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?
No. I remember signing things,
but I didn't know he'd made changes.
He can't get away with this.
This is fraud. You were sick.
No. I was diagnosed
six months ago.
Chris increased the policy
almost a year ago,
right after my 32nd birthday.
My mother was 33
when she died of cancer.
Oh, no.
- That Chris?
- He's here.
- Maybe he can explain this.
- No.
- Why not? Now's the time.
- This is not the time.
- When is the time?
- I don't know.
Please. I'm sorry, baby.
I'm just taking the trash out.
Thought you were working
a double tonight.
Yeah. Bet you did.
Howwas your appointment
on Saturday?
- Appointment?
- Yeah, with Dr. Frieland.
I didn't have an appointment.
- No? You sure?
- I'm sure.
'Cause Jay saw you
go inside his office.
You were going inside
with some other guy.
No, I just stopped by.
I had to ask some questions.
Now you were there.
I was there, but I had to
ask him some questions.
Here we go with the lies again.
- I'm not lying to you.
- Yes, you are!
Start telling me the truth!
- You're hurting me!
- Why do you make me do this?
I'm not making you do anything!
It ain't my goddamn fault!
It ain't my fault!
Chris, how you doing,
football player?
Good, Mathias.
How you doing?
I'm good.
Judy Anderson called,
said she saw a prowler
in the neighborhood.
You see anything?
What about your wife?
She home?
She didn't see anything.
- You didn't ask her.
- She didn't say anything about it.
Maybe I should ask her, not that
I don't trust your mind-reading.
- Hey, Ann, how you doing?
- I didn't see anything.
- I'm going to check the perimeter.
- Go ahead.
You see somebody,
you holler.
You have a good night.
- We did it.
- This wasn't necessary.
My name shouldn't be on your house.
I'll buy my own in a few years.
All right.
- Chief Whitlock.
- Hey, baby, it's me.
What time do you get off?
I've found a way to go to that clinic.
- Right.
- Can you talk?
- Hold on.
- Forget it.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
You know, I've got to go.
T ell her I say hi.
Bye.
Is this a bad time? Can you talk?
Yeah. It's no problem.
You've got to hear this.
It's incredible.
I name you the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.
No, no.
Not me personally.
You name The Living Gift
as your beneficiary
after we purchase
the policy from you.
And you-
I mean, The Living Gift-
collects on the policy
when I die.
As the beneficiary, yes,
we collect on the policy.
So you make a profit if she dies?
Is that legal?
- We wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- How much do I get?
The amount depends on how long
your medical staff says I have to live.
How about a ballpark figure?
- $750,000.
- I know.
Even if they have to repeat
the treatment several times,
there would be enough money
for us to go somewhere.
Like the Conch Festival
in Key West?
No.
Clambake in Opa Locka?
No! Europe.
- Europe?
- Yeah. Or Africa.
I'm going to beat this.
You watch.
Richard Petty, give me a hand.
Hey, man, watch it.
Don't slip. Watch that blood.
Come on, Ann, talk to me.
Their investors won't let them
buy any new policies.
The Living Gift?
We can go somewhere else.
We'll get somebody else to buy it.
I can't. There's only
two days left to change it.
What do you mean?
A provision says the beneficiary
can't be changed after a year,
and that's in two days.
Well, maybe we could call down...
It's too late!
- Listen...
- Don't, don't. Don't.
This is not fixable.
Just go.
Just go.
What did Alex pick up
from your place the other day?
I don't know.
Well, over for sure now, huh?
She left something so she'd
have a chance to come see you.
See if she still had feelings.
Based on what I saw, she didn't
have any feelings...except anger.
Think you've had enough.
I'm trying to help you here.
One of your patrons
has been overserved.
I may have to cite you
on that, Helena.
See you tomorrow, Chae.
See you tomorrow.
Man. Bustin' my chops,
Mr. Drinking-On-Duty.
I'll see you later.
- Good night.
- Take it easy.
Let me get you a refill, Chief.
No, I'm good, Chris.
It ain't a bribe, just a beer.
Two, whatever he was just drinking.
Thank you.
Let me ask you something.
That night you were out there
looking for that prowler,
did you see anybody?
No, I didn't.
I had this feeling when I got home
that Ann was with some other guy.
Really?
I think he snuck out the back
when I got home.
No, I didn't see anybody.
I'll tell you what, though.
Next time that little pussy
comes around...
Little pussy?
The guy scurries out the back door
the second he hears my voice.
- "Scurries"?
- Yeah.
I could almost respect a man
who had the balls to confront me,
tell me, "Yeah,
I'm banging your wife."
Maybe this guy,
maybe there's nothing
he would rather do than to tell you
that you're a lousy husband
and don't deserve Ann.
Maybe there's nothing
he would rather do
than to walk up to your face,
look you in the eye,
and say to you, "Chris,
I'm banging your wife...good."
Maybe. You know, maybe...
your wife won't let him.
I'd respect him at least.
And if he did that,
then I'd go up to him,
Iook him in his eye, and I'd say,
"Just come near her again...
...and I'll kill you."
Wow. You're talking to the wrong guy,
because as a police officer...
I can't let you go around
threatening people's lives.
If you're serious, I would
be obligated to do something.
Really?
That's right.
Thanks for the beer...
and the conversation.
- Thanks for listening.
- You give Ann my best, if you can.
You been waiting long?
Sorry about last night.
You must really be mad at me.
God, I used to love
coming out here with you.
I thought I was the shit, being
a freshman making out with a senior.
You were.
- Still are.
- I guess I was.
- Here.
- What's this?
My going-away present.
- Going away?
- lnsurance policy.
You're making me the beneficiary?
Buy that fishing boat you and Chae
have always talked about.
Right.
- Here.
- No. I'm leaving tomorrow.
What?
I'm leaving town tomorrow.
I've got to get out of here.
I need to get away from Chris.
I need some peace.
- Chief Whitlock.
- How can I help you?
You just did, buddy.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Take this.
Meet me at my house.
What is it?
It's a gift to you.
- Switzerland.
- What?
- It's money.
- What money?
That drug money?
Matt, no. Oh, my God.
What if they want it back?
By law, the money
has to stay in the custody
of the arresting department
until the appeals process is over.
With the money Scarcetti has,
it could take years.
But Tony and the guys...
They think I'm putting it
in a safe deposit box.
What time does Chris get home?
30.
Go to your house, pack a bag,
meet me at my house, 11:00.
You okay?
See you later.
What are you doing here?
Barbara's pissed off about something.
Got to wait her out.
Listen. You see anybody
come in here?
- No.
- You sure?
Okay. Why don't you
head over to the Scuttlebutt?
They cut me off,
no thanks to you.
Tell them Chief Whitlock
said everything's okay.
That's the first place
Barbara's going to look!
- She won't look there.
- She will!
I've got half a pack
of cigarettes in there!
Tell Engine Two to lay it out
and start attacking it from the back!
Go, go!
Pull it up! Let's get moving!
1919 on 415 San Juan.
That's about four miles
outside of town.
Go! Let's keep moving!
Aim the hose right there!
Mathias, you all right?
I know it's hard to take.
I'll grab you a cup of coffee.
- Was it an accident?
- I don't know. Maybe.
These propane tanks
just don't blow for no reason.
Man, this place was an inferno.
Those poor folks
didn't have a chance.
Hi, Chief.
Chief.
What are you doing here?
I'm a homicide detective,
and there's two dead bodies.
- So what happened?
- They think the propane tank blew.
You knowwho they are?
- I think it's definitely "were."
- Right, Chae.
Hey, Mathias, check it out.
Definitely arson.
It's definitely arson. Definitely.
The closer I stay
to the scene, the better.
Yeah, it's possibly
a double homicide.
We're gonna have to
take this thing over.
Chief, Judy Anderson's mom
is visiting from Orlando.
Last night, Judy said her mom
saw somebody sneaking around.
I checked it out,
didn't see anything.
We should probably tell Alex.
I'll tell her.
You get back to the office.
They want me to run my investigation
out of your place for the next 24.
I need your help-background
on the vics, people they knew.
- A tour guide?
- You cool with that?
- Okay. No problem.
- Are you sure?
No problem at all.
Why don't we ride back
and you fill me in on the Harrisons?
My boys will set up at your place.
- Okay.
- Great.
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry about the timing.
What do you mean?
With the papers,
and then this today.
The divorce papers?
- I should have called you before.
- That would have been nice.
I know.
But it has been eight months.
Don't you think we need closure?
I really don't want
to talk about it.
Thanks for opening up.
Let's talk about the Harrisons.
Either of them screwing around?
I don't know. Is anybody
happily married these days?
These have already
been gone through.
Right. He was supposed
to get off at 11:30.
Right. Mr. Harrison.
So you don't know if Mr. Harrison
came to work or not. Hold on.
Did you know she worked as
a dental hygienist for a Dr. Shider?
Really? No.
I'm going to pay him a visit.
You want to come?
Okay. Thanks.
So she quit yesterday?
Well, kind of. Ann Merai
had terminal cancer.
Really?
I think she was
trying to keep it quiet.
- Anything else you could tell us?
- I think she was having an affair.
Did she actually tell you
she was having an affair?
We don't really talk a lot, mainly
what's happening on our stories.
But I just got the feeling.
Sometimes when she'd be on
the phone, she would talk real quiet.
Whisper?
Did you ever see him,
or did she tell you who he was?
No. But he was classy.
About a week ago,
she got flowers from Rosie's.
Really nice. It was beautiful.
Remember, Bruce?
But I met her husband once,
and he just doesn't seem
like the type to send flowers.
Right.
Rosie! Chief Whitlock.
Listen, we're trying to find out
if some flowers were sent
to an Ann Merai Harrison
last week, sent to her office.
Harrison. Check and see
if one of your guys sent them.
- What hospital?
- Mercy Med.
- Chris Harrison.
- Her husband.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Rosie.
Yeah. No, that's all.
Thank you, Rosie.
If you'd like to make a call...
You ready?
I guess so.
Okay. All right.
Thank you for your help.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
If you think of anything else,
here's my card. Thanks a lot.
Please don't do me like that.
You knew I wasn't finished.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Shider gave me the name
of Ann Merai's doctor.
I want to find out more
about her cancer.
You can drop me off
back at the station.
You really don't like
being around me, do you?
No. I just, you know...
There isn't any reason for both of us
to be wasting time at the doctor's office.
What's so pressing
that you have to do?
I do have a job.
I am Chief of Police.
Yeah, of a four-person
department, Matt.
That's the problem
between the two of us.
You think your job
is more important than my job.
- Never said that.
- Yeah, you did.
You never say it directly,
but in indirect ways you say it.
You wanted to leave Banyan Key so we
could be closer to your important job.
You never said the commute
was taking time away from us?
- I didn't have a problem with that.
- You didn't?
- So I'm hearing things now?
- Whatever.
Is that the reason you're not coming?
Is that your date paging you?
One of my four officers checked in.
It's a tracking device.
And you can tell on that?
That's what it tells me. GPS.
We're all tied into it.
The mayor's brother sells them,
so we spent half the budget on them.
See, if we were moving,
you'd see it tracking.
Sorry.
If we were moving right now,
it would show us tracking.
Great.
Why don't we drive
to the doctor's office,
and I can see how it works?
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll meet you in there.
- Hi.
- May I help you?
Yeah. Dr. Donovan's office.
- Her office is on the third floor.
- Thank you, Ramona.
Ann Harrison didn't have cancer.
Are you sure?
Not counting the time
she spent in Atlanta,
Ann Merai has been my patient
since junior high.
If she had cancer,
I would have known about it.
I don't get it.
Maybe she saw another doctor.
She was here for her yearly
when she first got
back to town two months ago,
and she was healthy
as a proverbial horse.
I'm looking it over here, and...
I don't understand.
Who told you she had cancer?
Excuse me.
So...
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Dr. Frieland.
You're looking at him.
You're Dr. Frieland?
Yes, I am.
- Hold on, Pop.
- You're sure? This is your office?
It has been for ten years, yes.
Look, I'll get back to you.
Do you have a patient named
Ann Merai Harrison?
I really can't tell you that.
You can tell me.
Was she your patient or not?
Was she your patient or not?
Was she your patient or not?
No, I've never had
a patient by that name.
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure, very sure.
Yeah, I would know that.
Okay, I'm sorry.
That your pen?
- Pen? Yes.
- Do you use it much?
No, not very much.
You don't mind if I take it, do you?
No, you can have the pen.
Sure. It's yours.
Take it. It's yours.
Right.
Right.
I know that part. Hang on one sec.
Did you get
a checkup or something?
No. Just bad coffee.
All right.
No, just tell them
they've got to stop lagging.
We need
those phone records now.
All right. Thanks.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
We all good? Fantastic.
How's this, ma'am?
You fixed his nose already?
Just wonderful.
Hey, Chief.
How you doing, Judy?
I'm fine, thanks, considering...
Alex, we've got
an eyewitness here.
Mr. Anderson, this is
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.
Well, just...
We're on top of it.
I told them how Judy's mom
saw somebody
sneaking around
the Harrison place last night.
Got them right over there
sketching it out for us.
...the guy she saw
outside her window...
That's her right there?
- Good job.
- Chief, check this out.
Sketch of a prowler out to
the Harrisons' last night. Look.
Ring any bells?
Hi, Tony.
No. I mean, no.
He looked like him.
- Like who?
- Like him.
- Like me?
- Yeah. You.
Mom, he's the Chief of Police.
- So he was black, ma'am?
- Yeah, he was black.
Wait a minute. Maybe him.
Mrs. Anderson, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.
Anyway...
I'm so sorry.
Mother was raised
in a different time.
Don't worry about it.
We're on top of it, okay?
- I need to talk to you.
- I appreciate you coming down.
I am so embarrassed.
Please, you've got to stop.
I want you to take this
up to Miami for me, okay?
I want you to give it
to a Detective Gissen.
- Gissen?
- Gissen, right.
I'm going to give you his number.
I need prints on that ASAP.
- Is it for this thing?
- Yeah.
- Excuse me, Chief.
- Yeah.
An Agent Stark from the DEA
is on line one for you.
Who?
Agent Stark.
Said it's about the Scarcetti case.
Thank you.
Chief Whitlock.
Agent Stark, DEA.
How you doing?
- Busy.
- You and me both, pal.
I understand you guys are holding
evidence in the Scarcetti case.
Great. That makes you
my new best friend.
I'm going to send some agents
this aftemoon to pick up that cash.
We think it was used last year
in a sting operation with Paolo Estaban.
If we can tie the serial numbers
to the bills you guys have,
we can tie Estaban to Scarcetti.
This is a top priority
for us, Chief.
With this evidence, we can
kill two birds with one stone,
nail Estaban and Scarcetti.
Why don't I call you tomorrow,
and we figure out a time-
This had to be done
the day before yesterday.
We've got a court date next week.
The evidence has to stay with me
until the appeals process is over.
I didn't call you to get a lecture
on the rules of evidence.
We need to check the serial numbers,
and that's what we're going to do.
When I hang up on you
in ten seconds,
I want you to type up
a chain of evidence receipt.
One of my men will be happy
to sign it for you this aftemoon.
- Oh, yeah, and, Chief...
- Yeah?
It's been ten seconds.
Chief, you okay?
Yeah. Fine.
Just tell Gissen that I need
those prints really quick.
I'm sure Alex can-
We don't want to give them to Alex.
- Sorry. I just thought-
- Just do it!
All right. Okay.
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
Just go there, stay there,
and call me as soon as they're done.
You got it.
No, I've been on hold.
When should I call back?
Okay. Thanks.
Here you go.
Baste, my phone records!
How long can it take to fax over
a few sheets of paper?
I'll call them again.
- Alex, I think we got something here.
- What?
Look at this entry
into the checkbook, that last one.
- Is this the only entry you found?
- So far, but it's a new register.
What's going on?
They got a life insurance policy,
and we've got a potential murder.
Shit, there's got to be tons of these
life insurance companies, right?
Right.
- You got any pull at the bank?
- Sure.
- You want me to get an address?
- Please.
Sharlene, you know
that report I gave you?
They're not going to be able
to run them for another half an hour.
Call me when you've got something.
- T.
- Shit.
You should see the rack
on this chick
that just walked by.
- Just call me.
- Oh, my God.
- Those my phone records?
- No, just a fax for me.
Baste, what's up with my fax?
It's not here.
- She said she sent them.
- Who's she?
- Miss White.
- Who's Miss White?
She's a supervisor over there.
I've dealt with her before.
Call Miss White back.
They're not here.
I talked to her
a couple of minutes ago.
Detective...
Well, she assured me
that she sent them.
We need to call her back
and actually have her wait
as we see the fax coming through.
Sure, boss. Be happy to.
Miss White?
This is Detective Baste
with Miami-Dade.
Yeah, I just spoke to you
about the Harrison phone records.
I haven't received them yet.
What do you mean
you sent them?
I'm staring at the fax machine,
and it's not there.
I'm going to stand right in front of it.
If I don't hear the phone ring
in 30 seconds,
I'm going to your superiors.
Do I need to be more clear than that?
Can I use your computer for a sec?
Couple of minutes.
He just e-mailed me a bunch
of warrants I need to look up.
- 60 seconds.
- I'm not raising my voice!
You got writer's block.
No, just working on my report.
On what?
On somebody jaywalking?
Yeah, someone was jaywalking,
or urinating on the sidewalk,
or throwing spitballs
at a crossing guard.
It's a small office, but it's my office.
Phone records coming in.
- Is this it?
- It says "receiving."
Oh, shit. It's out of paper.
You're kidding me. Oh, God.
Could we get some paper, Sharlene?
Anybody got any paper? Paper, folks!
Don't all move at once.
Anybody in Banyan Key have paper?
It's about 81/2 by 11 inches...
Here you go.
What do you do? "Start"?
Here it comes.
We've got a little problem
with this machine.
It's fine, fine.
Great. Thank you.
Let me just get over here.
I hate this thing.
Here.
There we go. "Start."
There we go.
- I can't read this.
- It's the toner.
- Have her re-fax it.
- It's okay.
- I can read it. It's okay.
- No, fax it again.
That says Barry Thomas.
A friend of Chris' from high school.
I know him.
- That one is Will Blount.
- You guys okay?
It's okay.
This one is Frank Rhodes.
No. All the boxes go to Miami.
So the last call they made was
to American Airlines at 8 p.m.
Hey. Got a surprise for you.
Both of them already dead when
somebody turned them into s'mores.
- What?
- Both of them?
No sign of smoke in their lungs.
If they'd been alive
when that place went up,
their lungs would look like mine.
Alex, here are
the cell phone records.
Cell phone?
They're on a different database
than the land lines.
"Town of Banyan Key."
"12:34 a.m."
305-555-0199?
What time did grandma say
she saw that prowler?
After "Leno."
What time's "Leno" over?
Like 12:00, 12:30?
Hello?
This might be our guy.
How many phone calls
do you get after midnight?
Must be a bad connection.
All right. 555-0199.
Come on, come on.
Yeah. Okay. Let me see
if I can find the number for you.
I don't knowwho it is.
The Nextel subscriber
you are trying to reach
is outside the service area.
Please try again later.
No, I don't have it.
Whoever it is works
for the town of Banyan Key.
How do we find out
whose phone this is?
- All right, I'll...
- Just ask.
Is there anybody
even in Banyan Key?
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
Hey, Alex?
I'm sorry, I was drifting off there.
What'd you say that number was?
555-0199.
0199?
You're sure it's not 1099?
Chae, 0199.
0199? That's weird.
That's my cell phone number.
Yours?
- Yeah.
- Aren't you County?
I work part-time as a paramedic-
football games, school stuff.
And you called him last night?
I don't know.
Did l...?
Oh, Jesus,
I did call him last night.
I called him from the bar.
I wanted to see if he wanted
to have a couple of drinks.
- You're friends with him?
- I wouldn't say that.
He's, like,
my bottom-of-the-list guy
when you've got to have
somebody to drink with.
I would have mentioned it.
I totally forgot.
You should have told me this
at the scene, Chae.
I'm sorry. I don't remember
too much about last night.
I had a fight with Barbara.
I was in no good shape.
Check with the bartender-
I closed the place,
staggered home,
passed out next to my wife.
I didn't move until I got the call
to show up at the scene.
I need a statement.
I'll give you a statement
right now.
What's the matter with you?
You're like a love child
of Barney Fife and Joe Friday.
All right, a statement.
- What was that about?
- I was sleeping with her.
Jesus.
So you didn't...
No, but it was all a plan,
them coming back here.
They set me up,
planned the whole thing.
What plan?
What do you mean?
I gave her the Scarcetti money.
God!
Would you have given it to me
if I slept with you?
- Any trace of the money?
- None.
I thought I had trouble
with women.
Maybe you should just tell her.
- Who, Alex?
- Yeah. Tell Alex.
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they've got on me.
Motive-Ann Merai names me
beneficiary on her insurance policy,
and I was having an affair with her.
Opportunity-
an eyewitness saw me
outside their house
the night it blew up.
You want to hear some more?
Alibi.
Home, by myself.
That good? At least you
changed your cell phone number.
Even if Alex
wanted to believe me,
there's so much evidence
against me, she'd have to turn me in.
You're right.
That'd kill any chance
of getting back together.
What?
She says,
"Let's call the divorce off."
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at murder charges.
The gal's a peach. I don't know
what you were thinking.
Never mind. Forget it.
Can I do anything?
You don't think
obstruction of justice is enough?
I'm on a roll.
Chief Whitlock.
They matched the prints
on the pen.
The guy's name is Paul Cabot.
He's done time before.
They got his prints
from a criminal database.
You got an address?
Yeah. 36 ReefRoad, in Kendall.
All right, come on.
Hurry up.
- You want a beer?
- Nah, I'm okay.
What tangled webs we weave...
What you got?
Your doctor worked at the hospital,
but seems he was in my line of work.
Son of a gun.
Let's get out of here.
- Let me get the beer.
- Come on, let's go.
I've got to get the beer.
A beer in the hand
is worth two in the fridge.
What are you doing?
Bottom of the ninth.
Down by a lot of runs.
I got about ten grand in the bank.
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.
You think I'm done?
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not running.
No. The idea was I drive you.
Yeah, you can drive me.
Drive me back to the station.
- All right.
- All right.
Got your insurance company
on the line.
That policy number
corresponds to
a $1 million
term life insurance policy
for an Ann Merai Harrison.
Any messages there for me?
- Who's the beneficiary?
- Just a moment here.
Let's see. Looks like
the beneficiary is listed as...
... Chris Harrison, her husband.
Thank you.
You've been really helpful.
I'm sorry I couldn't be more-
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I got a note here.
The policy holder requested a form
to change the beneficiary last week.
So she changed it?
If she did, it hasn't made it
in the system yet.
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail, or...
It could be downstairs
in our processing center.
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?
I think they're still out to lunch.
All right, so call back
in half an hour?
Sure, why not?
Thank you.
This is Bill.
- How you doing?
- Good. What have you been up to?
You've got no idea.
Let me ask you a favor.
I've got a Capital One credit card
statement on a Paul Cabot.
I need you to find out
the last place he used his card.
I got something for you.
- C-A-B-O-T?
- Yeah.
- Can you hold?
- Yeah. No problem.
I found this under the seat
of one of the Harrison's cars.
It's a bank card receipt to a gas station
used by a guy named Paul Cabot.
Nice. Check the phone records.
- Already on it.
- Paul Cabot.
Anybody know or ever heard
of a Paul Cabot?
Come on, people, wake up.
Yes? No?
No.
Paul Cabot?
Frank, call the bank,
see what they've got.
No records of any incoming
or outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.
Check every restaurant,
gas station...
- Yeah?
- I've got something.
If this guy took a piss
and paid for it, I want to know.
He's got a reservation
at the Costa Coral Hotel.
- There's a hold on it now?
- Checked in yesterday.
- Costa Coral Hotel.
- You know where it is?
- Yeah. On Atlantic Avenue.
- Yeah.
You're a lifesaver.
- Chief Whitlock?
- Yeah.
Agent White.
This is Agent Fetzer.
We're here to pick up
the Scarcetti money.
Agent Stark said to send
the money to his office.
My guy left five minutes ago.
- He told you we'd pick it up.
- He said send it to his office.
He told you to send
the money to the office?
He'll tell you.
- Let me talk to him.
- He wants to talk to you.
What the hell is your problem?
I told you to get that money ready,
- that I was sending agents-
- You said-
What are you, a parrot,
telling me what I said?
I know what I said.
No, I'm not a parrot.
I know what you said.
Then where the hell is the money?
If you shut up for five minutes,
I can tell you where the money is.
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.
He should be up there
in about an hour.
If you have a problem with that
after I hang up in ten seconds,
call your partners at the lRS,
tell them to audit me.
- You little bastard!
- Agent Stark.
What? What?
- I meant five seconds.
- Damn it, Chief!
Sorry, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.
Can you hear me?
Sorry about your phone.
Can you hear me now?
Costa Coral Hotel.
Good aftemoon.
I just checked in to your hotel.
I'm trying to access my voice mail.
- You're not in your room.
- I'm on my cell phone.
Okay, that's no problem.
- Can you help me?
- Sure. What's your room number?
I don't remember. I just checked in.
- What's your name?
- Paul Cabot.
Please hold.
- You're in room 715.
- 715. Okay, thank you.
To access your voice mail...
Alex, we got a Paul Cabot
at a Costa Coral Hotel in Miami.
It's on Atlantic.
- He's supposed to be here already.
- These people work slow.
- Did you get those things?
- Yeah. You got a TV?
Watch pay-per-view.
Forget pay-per-view.
You got your wife under control?
Is she cool? She's not gonna...
She's not talking to nobody.
She's not going nowhere.
She's got too much to lose.
All right.
Damn, man.
You take a terrible picture.
Get yourself over here.
We've gotta get out of town.
Right.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
I left my key up in my room.
A knucklehead. 715. It's Cabot.
Paul Cabot, 715.
Happens all the time, Mr. Cabot.
Thank you.
Paul?
Paul Cabot, it's the police.
403, request
for driver's license info...
- There's somebody up there!
- What?
There's somebody up there!
Oh, my God!
Where?
See you, Mr. Cabot.
Do you have a Paul Cabot
registered here?
Yeah.
Someone was pushed off
the seventh-floor balcony!
How do you know he was pushed?
A man was seen climbing
back into his room.
- Calm down, relax.
- Which side of the building was it?
That's the guy!
That's him! That's Cabot!
I'll take four. You go upstairs.
- Stop!
- Jesus!
Mathias?
I pulled in right after you.
- Did he come down?
- Nobody came past me.
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- In the lobby.
Get these people out of here.
I'm gonna shut down the elevators.
It's him!
Police officer. Upstairs!
I'll cover the back!
- You got the money?
- Yeah, I got the money.
- Where'd you stash it?
- Right behind the seat.
Flight number 601,
non-stop to San Jose.
I'm not flying to Costa Rica.
Get off the phone.
- I gotta go.
- I'll swing by your house...
- Your new girl?
- No.
Weren't we supposed
to meet in the lobby?
I just had to get my cell
out of the car, make a call...
...to the office, you know,
checking on a lead.
- Let's go back upstairs.
- My boys are on it.
Why don't we go have a talk?
Sure.
You got something you want
to tell me or need to tell me?
What do you mean?
Something that I ought to know,
but that you might not want to say.
Congratulations
on making detective.
I'm proud of you.
I never said it, but I am.
I know you are.
You don't have to say it.
That's not what I'm talking about.
How'd you get to the hotel so fast?
I heard it on the radio.
So, nothing else you want to say?
I'm gonna sign those divorce papers.
- I'm not talking-
- I'll get to it. I just haven't...
- Believe me, I'll sign 'em.
- It's cool.
We're in no hurry.
Are we?
I'm not.
You knowwhat this place
reminds me of?
When we first started going out.
Remember when we used to talk
on the phone for hours?
And you had this thing.
You'd say, "Well,
I guess that's everything."
And you'd hang up on me.
And then you'd call right back.
That's right.
What would you say?
That I love you...
...very much.
I liked that.
Come here.
Come here, you have
something in your hair.
Chief...
These are from Agent Stark.
He sounded kind of pissed.
See you tomorrow, okay?
Detective, the hotel called.
The clerk's on his way
from the hospital.
Detective?
Call the insurance company, see if they
found out who the beneficiary is yet.
You got it.
- City Hall.
- Hi. Accounting, please.
Sure, let me get
that number for you.
I'm sorry, they've gone
home for the day.
- Of course they have. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Alex, did Cabot make any
phone calls from his hotel?
We're waiting on them.
Okay.
Chief, the hotel called.
They left a message.
The clerk left half an hour ago.
He should be here any minute.
Great.
Whitlock.
- Hello?
- Matt...
Matt, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It was never...
This is a surprise.
There's so much
I have to tell you.
I need to...
You got a lot of people
worried about you, Ann.
I know.
We all had the funny idea
that you were dead.
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Where's Chris?
Oh, God, I've lied to you
so much.
He forced me to do this.
He and his friend Paul found out
about the Scarcetti thing.
They stole bodies from the morgue.
- You switched the dental records.
- I had to.
I had to.
They said they'd kill me.
See, Paul was a criminal, Matt.
- He was?
- Yes.
He was killed today.
They made me do this.
Now it looks like
you and I faked my death
to collect on the insurance policy.
So what do you want me to do?
I don't want to
have to face them
and have to answer
questions about this.
I gotta get out of town,
but I don't know where to go.
And I need money.
So where's Chris?
You're right.
I should have come to you earlier.
He's there, isn't he?
Yes.
I would have contacted you earlier,
but I knew you would think
it was another trick.
I don't blame you.
He beat me up and...
- Matt?
- Yeah.
He beat me up and...
- See, Paul had the money-
- I have the money.
No, I don't want to involve you
in any more of this.
Where are you?
I'm here at the old boat.
Stay there. I'll meet you.
I've interviewed her twice already,
and it does match up.
- Neil, Detective Diaz-Whitlock.
- Hi.
- Ouch. How you feeling?
- I'm okay.
You're up for answering
a few questions? Yeah?
You need anything else?
This way.
All right, take a seat to your left.
Here you go.
- Where's Chief Whitlock?
- I don't know. Bathroom, maybe.
Alex, insurance company, line two.
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.
Detective, I got your beneficiary.
It's a Mathias Lee Whitlock.
Thank you.
Agent Stark, DEA.
I'm looking for Chief Whitlock.
- How much was it?
- 485,000.
Did he arrange to have it
picked up or dropped off?
He told my agents he was sending it
to my office. Nobody showed.
I'm sure it was
just miscommunication.
That's a.38, Chris.
Only six shots.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!
He's gone.
You all right?
Give me the gun.
Wait a minute.
You said he beat you up.
It was self-defense.
No jury would convict you.
Just put the gun down.
You think Chris
did this to my face?
I think you should
put your gun on the floor.
What?
Put it down. I didn't think
I could do this, but I will.
You set this up.
- Put your gun on the floor.
- Are you sure?
Don't do this.
Where's the money?
Come on. Jesus!
So you...
We didn't mean anything
to each other?
- It's not important.
- That's not important now.
- It was just all an act?
- Where's the money?
Look me in the eye and tell me
you didn't mean any of it.
Some of it!
Don't try to confuse me!
- I don't have any choice now.
- You don't have to do this.
I've known you all your life.
You're not a criminal.
- You know I know you-
- Stop!
What?!
Okay. All right,
high-school sweetheart.
You think I'm playing?
I'm not playing.
Damn!
- I was aiming for your arm.
- Well, you missed!
- Where is it?
- Outside the door.
- Show me!
- All right.
Just calm down. Just wait a minute.
Just wait. Don't shoot me.
I'm just gonna reach for it.
Show me!
- Here it is.
- Put it down.
- Wait, don't shoot me.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm the one that got you the money.
I'm trying to save your life.
It wasn't all an act. I can't live broke.
Life ain't shit when you're broke.
- Shit!
- Wait!
Wait, no!
Oh, my God.
- Anyone else up here?
- No.
How'd you find me?
- Are you hit?
- No, I'm okay.
I'm all right.
It's Alex. Get me an ambulance
and a med examiner.
No, I'm fine. I'm at the end
of Runyon Road on the dock.
Hurry.
Did you kill Paul Cabot?
No...
It was self-defense.
He was attacking me.
I was trying
to get the money back.
You were just gonna
hand the money back?
- That's what I was trying to do.
- Then what's that over there?
What do you got?
Chris and Ann Harrison's
bodies are upstairs.
The real ones.
They were both working for Cabot.
Chief found out they were here
and took care of business, right?
Right.
- Let's move.
- Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Your guy never
showed up, Whitlock.
Agent Stark?
Yeah.
I don't care
if you're injured or not.
I want that evidence money, or you're
gonna be looking at a case-
Where the hell is Southeast
63rd Street in Miami?
53rd Street. I told you
53rd Street, not 63rd.
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.
I said Southeast 53rd-
You said,
"Those assholes in the DEA
are at 8400
Southeast 63rd Street."
I didn't. I'm very sorry.
What I said was,
"Those assholes from the DEA
are at 8400 Southeast 53rd."
- 63rd.
- Never mind.
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.
You don't have to count it.
It's all there. Have a safe ride home.
- Come on.
- Assholes.
- It is all there, right?
- Most of it.
It's all there.
That's a pretty good one.
Nice touch.
A little over the top.
- Which part?
- Your part.
You're the one
that came in here screaming.
What happened to you, man?
Just never leave your wife.
That's what happened to me.
I'd take the bullet.
Be careful there. It's a classic.
That grille work comes from France.
- How you feeling? Excuse us.
- Yes, ma'am.
Did you love her?
No.
Why would you do this, then?
Because I'm...
Because I'm stupid.
Because...
I thought I was doing the right thing,
trying to help her, but it's no excuse.
Sometimes people,
you know, do stupid things.
Especially when they're still in love.
Thank you.
Let's go.
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.
He called all worked up
about something.
Okay.
- You want to sit down?
- Yeah.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- I asked that already?
- Yes. I said I was good.
- You want a beer?
- Yes.
I don't have any left.
You can share mine, though.
So what brings you out this way?
I just needed to move
the rest of my stuff.
That's cool, I guess.
The house is a mess.
This came for you at the station.
You opened it?
You opened my mail?
- Why you always opening my mail?
- Just read it.
They just want you
to fill out the forms.
"To claim amount payable
to the beneficiary
for the sum of $1 million."
- What?
- We're rich.
We're rich.
How about that?
- $1 million.
- Easy, Chae.
- He can't take that money.
- I can't take the money?
- Why not?
- It's a conflict of interest.
- He's the legal beneficiary.
- I am the legal beneficiary.
And he's one of
the arresting officers.
What the hell's that
got to do with anything?
Tell him how much trouble
you can get in.
It's a million bucks!
It's the chance of a lifetime! No!
As his wife, I'm telling you
he's not taking that money.
- As my wife?
- As your wife.
Come on.
Come on, don't fall for that.
- What do you mean, as my wife?
- As your wife.
You said you came
to move your stuff.
I'm moving back in.
This is great. Congratulations.
It's kind of fortuitous.
- You serious?
- Yeah.
Are you gonna behave?
I'm actually afraid
to leave you by yourself.
You won the sweepstakes, man.
You can do this later.
It's a million bucks.
Let's not lose focus.
You know, a honeymoon fund,
a nursery wing for the...
This is the golden pot
at the end of the storm thing!
Just sign it before you go in, huh?
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.
I'm gonna be sitting out here
when you're finished.
I can wait three minutes.
I'm a patient man.
I am a patient man.
Come on!
