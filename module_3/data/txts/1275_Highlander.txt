He is immortal.
Born in the Highlands of Scotland
400 hundred years ago.
He's not alone.
There are others like him.
Some good,
some evil.
For centuries he's battled
the forces of darkness
with holy ground his only refuge.
He cannot die,
unless you take his head and with it his power.
In the end, there can be only one.
He is Duncan MacLeod,
the Highlander.
Here we are.
Born to be kings.
We're the princes of the universe.
I am Immortal.
I have inside me blood of kings.
I have no rival.
No man can be my equal.
Take me to the future of the world.
Anthony Gallen.
Duncan MacLeod of the clan MacLeod.
Come on, live. Breath! Breath!
It's all right. It's okay.
It's all right, breathe.
You're gonna be all right.
Tommy Bannen?
That was his name.
And you never came across this Gallen before?
No.
You must've been more than he bargained for.
It was an even match, Richie.
Then how come he took off?
I don't know.
Too bad about the Bannen kid. The guy was
in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
That's no reason for him to be dead, Richie.
You didn't hit the guy. Mac.
You think that Gallen is losing sleep over this?
Hey, I'm not Gallen.
Take it easy, I didn't say you were.
You want to talk about it?
- No. You want some breakfast?
- Sure.
Look, Mac. If you don't want to discus it,
I understand. But there's nothing you can do
for Tommy Bannen.
I'm going to his funeral.
I'm Betty Bannen. I don't think we've met.
I'm Duncan MacLeod.
You were the one who tried to save him?
I'm sorry, it wasn't enough.
You did what you could.
I thank you for that with all my heart.
I should be going.
Would you... would you stay a while,
Mr. MacLeod? Please.
You were the last one to see my Tommy alive.
Of course.
Annapolis, Maryland - 1866
You do that very well.
You think you're the first man
who ever courted me?
Only if the men around here are fools.
The girls say men are like horses - big and
stupid. But they do have their uses.
You're comparing me to a horse?
Well, you're certainly not stupid.
And as for uses.
Bastard! Get out of the wagon!
Who are you?
That's Ned.
Her fiance.
Your fiance? We have to talk about this.
Bess and I will talk about it when you're dead.
She was sworn to marry me!
It was my parents' idea, not mine.
Give me satisfaction!
Well, you have me at a slight disadvantage.
Then get out and arm yourself!
Duncan, please! Duncan, please!
Tell him, not me.
Come down and meet your fate.
Ned, let this go before there's more harm.
Ned, do not hurt him!
No!
Duncan, watch out!
Ned, stop it! Duncan!
No, Bess! Stay back!
Bess.
It was an accident.
Bess?
Bess, my God!
You dare to come here?
I would give anything to undo this.
It's you who should be dead!
If I could, I would.
She was supposed to marry Ned,
then you came
and now Ned will be court-martialed
and we have nothing!
You'll have whatever you need,
I swear. Anything.
Can you bring Bess back?
She was my only child! May you rot in hell!
I raised Tommy by myself.
My husband died in Vietnam. He'd only
been an American citizen three years.
I'm sorry.
He was a soldier.
After he was gone, I thought about
going home to the Highlands.
Someday, I'd like to go back there to live.
Why don't you?
Money.
Tommy helped with expenses,
but he was just a reporter.
What kind of reporting did he do?
Investigative.
He wanted his own byline,
but he was always working undercover.
He promised me that one day
I'd see his name.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.
You can tell me what you like.
Mr. MacLeod. Was it really an accident?
What do you mean?
Well, I don't know,
but the last time I saw Tommy,
he was really scared about something.
It was like he thought he was in danger.
From what?
Well, he wouldn't tell me.
Said it was for my own protection.
Betty, I'm so sorry that we're late.
That's all right, Suzanne.
You're here now.
I don't believe you've met
my father, Mr. Honniger.
- My sympathies, Mrs. Bannen.
- Thank you.
This is Duncan MacLeod.
He tried to save Tommy.
Then we have to thank Mr. MacLeod.
Tommy was a fine young man.
We'll all miss him at the paper.
Will you forgive us if we run? We have
a board meeting at four. I'll call.
She won't call.
She's not the type.
But my Tommy was in love with her.
Mrs. Bannen, if you need anything,
anything at all,
don't hesitate to call.
Us Highlanders have to stick together.
Too bad we're on Holy Ground, uh?
We'll be off it one day.
So, what makes you think
Gallen's not in town to hunt you, Mac?
Because he didn't know my name
before we fought, it was a chance meeting.
What I can't figure is what
he was doing in that cemetery.
Unless he was reacquainting himself with some
old pals, Mac, he had to be after you.
No, he couldn't have known I'd be there.
And If he'd followed me
I would have sensed him.
That's true. Okay, so,
if he wasn't there for you,
and we know he wasn't sentimental about
Tommy Bannen, who's left?
Well, there is Betty Bannen,
but I don't think so.
And there's Suzanne, his girlfriend. And her
father, Mike Honniger who he worked for.
Honniger? The guy's no Immortal,
but he does own Honniger Communications.
That's three newspapers and half a dozen TV
and radio stations.
Maybe... Or maybe it wasn't a coincidence that
Tommy was there when I fought Gallen.
Maybe he was investigating Gallen
for Honniger's paper.
Exactly. This could have something to do with
Gallen's Immortality.
Maybe.
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go down to
Honniger's paper and I'm gonna ask
a few questions.
There's a few questions I want to ask too.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I've come to see Mr. Honniger.
Do you have an appointment?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
Then you couldn't see him even if he was in.
Thank you.
Mr. Honniger.
Mr. MacLeod. It's nice to see you again.
Call me Duncan.
Should I call security?
No. That's all right Claire.
My father's not in at the moment.
Didn't Claire tell you?
Yes, she did, but I saw the guy leaving
as if he'd just been fired.
He has just been fired.
I've been a vice president at Honniger
Communications for two years.
I assure you I've earned the title.
Nice pieces.
Yeah, my father is quite a collector of things.
Now, what can I do for you?
Do you know what Tommy was working on
before he died?
No. We didn't talk much
about his assignments. Why?
Betty seems to think his death was tied to
whatever he was working on.
She thinks that it was deliberate?
You were there. You told the police
it was an accident.
It seemed that way at the time.
And now?
I'm not sure.
If there's any chance this wasn't an accident,
we have to find out.
My father might know
what he was working on.
Do you think I can talk to him?
Yeah. Why don't you come by
the house this afternoon?
Okay.
I'll get you a card.
Tommy and I were good friends.
Betty told me. I'm sorry.
Yeah, we're from different worlds,
but it worked for us.
I just want to tell you how much
I appreciate all you tried to do.
See you this afternoon?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
His name is Tommy Bannen.
Never heard of him. What's he do?
He works up here. He's a reporter.
Not that I know.
You know Tommy Bannen.
He works specials.
Specials? Is that kind of like undercover?
That's right, undercover.
Sure, I remember him now.
Short guy.
Yeah, about five-five.
Balding. About forty?
I was always thinking he looked older.
You know, I told him he would look
a lot younger if he wore a piece.
Well, I don't see him around.
That's some story the guy's working on, uh?
Some story.
He talk to you guys about it?
No.
No, the man kept pretty much to himself,
you know? Hey, Klacsone!
Take this over to Petrovitz.
So, where is his desk?
I think he worked mostly out of his home.
Yeah, a lot of investigative guys do that.
It's kind of a personality thing.
Yeah, right, right.
Listen, we've got a paper to get out here.
Yeah, sure. Listen, if you guys do see Tommy,
you tell him I'm looking for him, okay?
Yeah, sure. Listen, what did you say
your name was?
Richards. Jordan Richards.
Take care, boys.
See you later, Jordan.
Yeah, Frank.
They had no idea who Tommy Bannen was,
Mac. They didn't even know he was dead.
And why would Mrs. Bannen and Honniger say
that he worked there when he didn't?
That's just the thing, he did.
You see, I went down to payroll, I told them
I'm a friend of Tommy Bannen he's sick
and wanted me to pick up his paycheck.
It was for two grand.
Nice salary for a guy without a desk
or a phone extension.
Exactly. So, now what?
Now the Honnigers are expecting me.
The Honnigers? That would include Suzanne.
I'm correct, right?
I checked out her picture, Mac.
Maybe needs some company.
You know, you'll talk to her father
and I'll talk to her.
Richie, this is work.
It's not like I'm gonna enjoy it.
So let me do it!
I mean, Suzanne Honniger's only, what?
Twenty-eight years old?
Twenty five. And incredibly beautiful.
Twenty five? And how old are you?
Four hundred. But you know what, Richie?
Today I feel like a kid.
Who is that?
Duncan MacLeod.
Come in, Mr. MacLeod.
In here please. Mr. Honniger will be with you
in a moment.
Like it? It's a Luigi Balda.
Turn of the century Italian.
Would you believe I got it for almost nothing?
That depends on what you call
almost nothing.
Under twenty thousand.
Then you got a bargain.
Always nice to get an expert opinion. Drink?
No, thanks.
Really?
My father always told me to be suspicious of
men who don't drink.
Are you suspicious of me?
Actually I'm curious.
About what?
About what you were doing at that amusement
park so early in the morning.
I was out jogging, minding my own business.
Whose business was Tommy minding?
Mine. Please.
Look, Suzanne told me
about Mrs. Bennan worries.
So, I checked with my editors.
Tommy wasn't working on anything that
could've gotten him killed.
You mind if I ask what he was working on?
You mind telling me
why you're so interested in him?
When a man dies in your arms,
you get interested.
Exactly what kind of antique dealer
are you, MacLeod?
You should know that.
You checked me out, didn't you?
A man in my kind of position
can't be too careful.
What kind of position is that?
On top.
Don't worry about Daddy, Mr. MacLeod.
He's suspicious of everybody,
including me. Please.
My daughter graduated from Vassar
in three years
and got her Master's from Wharton in one,
but she has a lot to learn about real life.
Survival is not learned from reading a book.
Please, Daddy, no more stories
about fighting with baseball bats
to get the best Newspaper route.
For someone who wants to run my company,
you're incredibly naive.
Mr. MacLeod here, has lived here and in Paris,
and in half a dozen other cities.
His name turns up in a stack of
unsolved police files.
Some antique dealer.
That piece over there, is worth
forty thousand dollars.
It came from Vienna, not Italy,
and the carver was Wolfgang Boche.
Who's Luigi Balda, your hairdresser?
My attorney.
Touche. Nicely done, Mr. MacLeod.
Thank you.
You're welcome. So, about Tommy.
Your father doesn't think there's a connection.
Frankly, neither do I.
Those calls that I made nothing.
If he was working on something,
he kept it to himself.
Did he keep any notes anywhere?
He had an apartment in the Rivercrest Arms
the corner of Rivercrest and Watson.
You might try there.
You'd be wasting your time.
It's mine to waste.
As you like. Good day, Mr. MacLeod.
Good day.
Well, well, well. Why did Honniger send you?
Go to hell.
You first.
Help! Help! Help!
Hey you, let me out. You're crazy.
I'm just impatient.
Now what are you doing here?
Well, up yours.
Well, that's very brave,
but not very smart. Come on!
Think about it,
you might chip a tooth down there.
All right! All right. It was Honniger.
That was who, now why?
Come on, my arms are getting tired!
Okay, he thought somebody
was trying to kill him.
And?
He pays big money to know
what's going on the street.
Now, word came back that
there was a contract down on his life.
And he figured it was you.
Why me?
Because of your file!
Because your history with the cops!
Because you killed Tommy Bannen!
Why would I hit Tommy Bannen?
How the hell should I know?
All right, all right!
Honniger said whoever hit Tommy
was out to kill him.
Okay? Now let me out.
Say please.
Hey you son of...
Please.
Pretty please.
I don't like letting you out of my sight.
Now, it's not that I don't trust you, but
What does trust got to do with it?
You're being well paid in more ways than one.
Didn't I warn you about Tommy?
The bastard was good. I never thought
he'd find me. MacLeod is next.
Don't worry about him. Daddy thinks
he's the hitman who's after him.
He's sending Johnson to take care of him.
Johnson'll fail.
How do you know?
Because I know. You leave MacLeod to me.
You understand me?
You're hurting me.
I love it when you play rough.
Mrs. Bennen.
I'm sorry to bother you.
It's okay. When I offered to help,
I meant it. What can I do for you?
I need your advice.
Then you're gonna have to tell me
what it's about.
When Tommy's lawyer called he told me
Tommy's will left me everything.
There wasn't much except
a key to a safety deposit box.
So you opened it? What did you find?
There's over two hundred thousand dollars
in cash in there.
Duncan, Tommy was just a reporter.
Where would he get that kind of money?
I don't know. What are you going to do with it?
Well, my mother said,
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
Then use it. Go back to the Highlands.
It's what Tommy would have wanted.
Well, I thought of that.
But without knowing where he got it.
All right, I understand. Put it in the bank for now.
There's nothing wrong with just having it.
I still don't see why Johnson couldn't drive.
Come on, Daddy. We never get to spend time
alone together. We'll have fun.
Damn, I forgot.
I got to get those bank proposals.
I'll wait.
Johnson, let's go.
I told you to stay close to us.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Honniger.
Who is this? How did you get this number?
Your daughter gave it to me.
She also gave me a message for you.
What message?
She told me to tell you goodbye.
I thought you'd be too grief-stricken to work.
Life goes on.
Not for everyone. What was worth
eight thousand dollars a week?
What do you mean?
I got hold of Tommy's pay stubs.
I ran his social security number.
Your father was paying him
two thousand dollars a week
through four different companies.
No tax evasion charges for little old Tommy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Of course you do. You know everything
that goes on in this company.
You're right. I do. I am this company.
My father hasn't made a decision
on his own in years.
Daddy's little girl. Couldn't you wait
until he handed over the reins?
Daddy was a very healthy man.
I would've had to wait twenty or thirty years.
Patience never was one of my virtues.
This man killed my father.
Take care of him.
Remember me?
Yeah, you're the guy who's afraid of heights.
Not here.
Your pants still wet?
Get him out of here.
How was the funeral?
It was wonderful.
Even the Governor was there.
So, how much are you worth now?
287 million dollars. But who is counting?
Since I did the job.
I'll take my money.
That was one million.
Two.
My mistake.
- It's a bargain. Cheers.
- Cheers.
I'll get it.
You know maybe in a couple of months
I could come back, uh?
We could have a lot of fun.
I don't think you'll be coming back.
You may be surprised.
I don't think so.
Surprise!
Like the stroke of a sword, one second is life
next second is gone.
I don't want him to die.
Her fight isn't their fight.
I should've stopped her.
We have to be careful.
Human life is too fragile.
Tommy, Bess all of them might be so fragile.
Bess.
No matter what you do,
death comes when it's ready,
on its own time, not yours.
You can't keep it forever.
I wanted to say good bye.
Gallen killed Tommy.
But why kill him?
Her fight isn't this fight.
Why kill Tommy? Gallen knows.
Something is missing.
Suzanne Honniger.
Suzanne and Tommy.
Tommy dies.
Now is the time for confirmation.
Tommy works for Honniger.
What was he really doing there?
Gallen was dead.
But who was Tommy?
This comes on its own time.
What was Tommy doing there?
Tommy and Gallen, something is missing.
Tommy wasn't in the wrong place.
Tommy was in the right place.
Tommy was there for a reason,
but the reason wasn't me.
Tommy is dead. Honniger is dead.
Suzanne's in the center.
Tommy is dead.
Tommy was there for a reason.
Was it really an accident?
Maybe Tommy was dead too.
You'll be wasting your time.
It's all connected.
May you rot in hell!
It has to be connected.
Hey. Hey! Does this look familiar?
Hold on. No, not from this angle.
You got a smart mouth.
But not for much longer.
Miss Honniger said to get rid of you.
But she doesn't much care how.
You had a good time when you were up here,
where are you now?
Why don't you just shut up, and let me go.
Say please. Have a nice flight.
I say we go back and have a little chat
with your friend, Suzanne.
She's not gonna tell us anything.
All right, well. In that case, do you have
any idea what we are looking for?
No, we'll know when we find it.
What we know is that Tommy
was being payed
a ton of money by Honniger or something.
That Gallen went out of his way to kill him.
When Gallen first jumped me,
he was over there.
The fight took us half way up the rollercoaster.
Then Gallen, got hold me and push me down.
When I looked back, he had disappeared.
I looked down here, and
Tommy was standing here by his Corvette.
Standing over there.
As Tommy was standing this way.
Gallen's car came from the right, accelerating
straight for Tommy and he hit him.
So, obviously he nailed Tommy on purpose.
The question is why?
Mac, what are you doing?
Looking for something.
I think I just found it.
Catch it.
A 9 mm hitman's weapon.
How'd you know this bag was down there?
Tommy was holding it,
it went flying when he was hit.
Tommy was carrying a gun.
And he was coming to kill Gallen.
Nice of you to drop in.
Well, we have some unfinished business.
But this time we won't be interrupted, will we?
You're the one who killed Honniger.
And Honniger knew you were coming after him.
So, he sent Tommy to stop you.
You should've used that.
I didn't want to have to handle both of you.
But now I'm all yours, MacLeod.
Really? How much is she paying you?
The bitch? Tried to double-cross me.
She actually tried to kill me.
Come on, Mac.
Let's take out this son of a bitch.
No, Richie. One on one,
you know the rules.
That's right, Richie. You run along now
and live a little longer, uh?
I'll see you soon enough.
I doubt it.
Shall we rock and roll?
Come on, MacLeod! Come! Come!
FATHER/DAUGHTER MURDER PACT
By Tommy?
But this is today's paper, how could he?
You wrote this.
I just put the words on the paper. Because of
Tommy that those people were caught.
But the money, the two hundred thousand?
Sometimes, when a reporter is
on a risky assignment,
he can ask for the money up front.
So, the money really was his?
It's yours.
Thank you.
You brought my Tommy back to me.
If you could use some of that money-
Take it. Go back to Scotland,
back to the Highlands like you wanted.
See them for me.
I will.
Duncan! When I'm over there,
you'll come visit me?
That's a promise.
