Don't want to pack any longer.
Don't want to.
I don't want you to come along.
Can't pack when you're here.
Who's that?
Do you never think about anything else?
- No.
Morning.
Good morning.
I still believe
you're thinking about it.
I can't help it.
Get up.
What are you doing?
We're getting up.
You have been lying there
the whole morning. Get up now.
I can't.
Why can't you get up, Jan?
Ask your mother...
It's because dad always
thinks about the same thing.
We have to drive now.
Get up now.
- Go away, you two.
No, not now.
- I have to pack that rotten suitcase.
If we don't leave now, we'll be late.
I have to buy something. Let go, Jan.
Yes...
Dad, you have to get up.
I'm off work.
Don't dictate my actions.
Ilse.
Touch me there once more,
and then get up.
What is it, that Jan does?
He's nice.
Get up now!
I can't
He got up now.
- Yes.
He ran.
Come here, mousy.
Morten is stupid.
We can just bring your own pool toy.
Morten is alright.
I like Henrik better.
- Yes.
Best of all, I like Jan.
Where did he touch you?
- Right here!
Christ!
It's you?
Don't act up out there.
Come inside, we're on our way.
Lars, come over here.
Jan is in the bathroom. You arrive
at strange times, but it's pleasant.
Are you drunk?
Tine!
Tine, come on, you brat!
Go down after her.
Morten, go down after her.
- No, Knud.
Can't you hear what Bet says?
- Stop it.
Tine!
Tine, come on.
I did the dishes after lunch...
Summer holidays are so horrible...
Come on up with us.
We have to go up.
I'll get her bucket.
Was that really necessary?
What are you doing?
I'm getting dressed.
Do you realise what time it is?
Yes.
I didn't want them to come.
Oh, stop it.
- No.
Aren't you looking forward to it?
Yes, yes. They're arriving now.
Oh, stop that!
Stop it.
Are we missing anything?
There's always something missing.
Get this and bring Morten along.
Drive to the grocer's, the butcher's,
and the greengrocer's.
Why do I have to take him along?
- Because it's your son.
It's your son too.
- Yes.
It's much more fun...
- Give me the key.
Then you can stay at home with both,
cook, lay the table, and dress Tine.
What do I have to get?
No, behave yourselves!
Don't, Morten. Be nice and go outside.
Do we have sardines?
- Yes, we have sardines.
Read the note. It states what we need.
If you want anything, just buy it.
In a moment I'll punch you.
- Then do it.
Dear Lord, you're angry. Why?
- Yes.
Give me the key.
You're a bit too fat.
Can you get a pimple in your mouth?
Should I tell you about Ernst?
- What Ernst?
Ernst.
- Oh, him.
Yes.
- Did he also tell you, you're too fat?
Ernst could do many things you can't.
- Then take him back?
Yes.
Oh, shut up. What is this?
What do I have to buy?
You aren't that fat.
You're such an arsehole.
A young woman shouldn't say that.
You animal! I can't stand it any longer!
I ought to cut you open.
You can begin by slicing a bit off
your rolls of fat.
I've had two children.
- Oh, pathos!
Not all girls get fat after childbirth.
- I hate it, I hate it!
I don't want guests.
I don't want to stay here.
You don't love me anymore.
- <i>Tralilalulalej</i>.
Look what Lars is doing.
One is perhaps not permitted?
Isn't it a bit early?
Anyway, you aren't very polite.
Master builder?
No, thanks.
Why did Lars have to come?
- That's a good question.
One is perhaps not welcome?
You mustn't.
Do you know the one about Georg the
one-legged duck? It had been in the war.
Why did it only have one leg?
It had lost the other in the war.
Was it shot?
- Yes.
It isn't true.
- Yes.
You're stupid.
- Tanja.
There's also the one about the man who
came home and found a peewee in bed...
Once more.
There's also the one about the man who
came home and found a peewee in bed...
Do you know it?
- No.
It, of course, depends on
how you pronounce it. Peewee - peeved.
Peeved!?
I'm not popular...
Should I get off?
- Yes, you should.
Goodbye.
- No!
Stop it.
What's that?
- A fossilisation, I think.
It's a rock...
I thought it was a sea urchin.
I have a stomach ache.
- Yes, I know.
It hurts.
- Should we not go over there?
No.
- Because, surely, we can do that.
We can easily not go there
when we have been invited.
You don't like them anyway...
Such nonsense.
- They're so troublesome, right?
Why do we even see them? Why can't we
stay apart, just for the holidays?
You know what, you can go there. Then
I'll go home. It's your friends, right?
What do mean?
- Bet is your friend.
Yes.
Also, why must there be a physiological
difference between men and women?
Your stomach always hurts. You must sit
and stare, can't swim, can't nothing.
Should we move on?
I think, we might as well go home.
I know what will happen. We drink,
then we fool around or quarrel.
You just sit and look grumpy.
You won't do anything with the others
and I'm not allowed to do anything.
Why the hell is it like that?
Because you have to suffer.
- As it wasn't bad enough already...
You knew it before we came.
- A crevice or a place an egg falls to.
Then you have to show consideration
and not worsen it for oneself or others.
Finally you don't want to anymore.
I don't want to go there!
Then we'll go home.
I would rather not go anyway.
There: grumpy and impossible, right?
At times it seems like you have
stomach ache the entire month.
And some can even get children...
Come on.
Yes.
Thank you, Birthe.
In my opinion, pedagogically
you have to try something like that.
Not because I believe you can lay down
rules, but you also have to survive.
Have you tried beatings?
- Yes. Yes and no, I get so embarrassed.
It depends on who you beat?
- If it was you, it would be different.
Pig.
- Pig?
Can we swim before we feed?
I'm too hungry.
- Yes. We have to eat now.
I've been toiling all day...
You're pretty, girls.
Aren't they good-looking?
Tove?
Are you there, Tove?
Is there more in the jar?
- Try to wrench it.
You shouldn't get totally knocked over
before sun-down anyway.
Right, Kjeld?
I would have liked
to have worn it today.
Then we have to ask:
"Which one, dear?"
Guess.
- Should we all try?
Let's give it a try.
Come on, let's guess.
Your new...
- Camel hair waistcoat.
My new swimsuit...
Have you gotten a new one again?
It hoists and supports...
- So that's what it does?
I didn't plan to buy a new this year,
but then I looked in the mirror one day.
I thought, something had to be done
if I was to show that pale meat.
And then I bought it.
- Then you bought it.
Put it on.
- No.
Sorry, <i>papa</i>.
I feel like it...
It has stripes.
Bottoms up.
Dinner!
- Thank you.
It always takes a while anyway.
- What?
The dinner.
Jan, I have exactly the same case
at school with my kids every day.
I enter the class room and
the whole class stands on the forms.
I need some pate.
Pate!
Give me some pate!
Pate! Pate!
There has to be room for us all.
- He's a monkey.
The thing is, you try
to make them understand.
How to say it;
that you're also a kind of human.
I don't really want them any harm -
except that the process of making them
understand demands concentration.
Pedagogy... Pedagogy, I don't know,
even in it's most distinguished state -
requires a kind of discipline.
I have to pee!
Then pee, but leave the table.
- Go to Tanja and pee.
Why won't anybody say cheers?
Cheers!
We're all supposed to be so liberated,
but you sit with your old conventions -
and can't even drink
because you have to say cheers.
Cheers, poor thing.
- Cheers.
Why can't the youth
have fun without liquor?
Yabadabadoo!
- Stay out! And you're too old.
Give me more and you'll get my version.
- Yes. Give he some more.
That's why.
That's why.
Now I'm ready. The youth can't have fun
without liquor because the youth is...
I can't...
- Great. Great!
Because the youth is
so despairingly liberated.
Thanks for those words.
Why does dad say so much?
- Say so much? I don't know.
Cheers, dear.
If I tell you to sleep with me, Tove,
then what do answer?
I have stomach ache,
so it's not possible.
In the middle of dinner, huh?
Why doesn't anyone ever say that to me?
I'm outrageously liberated.
Perhaps that's the reason?
No one was talking to you.
Mom, we have peed.
That's fine.
Those daft kids must go to bed.
Birthe, can you put the children to bed?
- I'll be right there.
We don't want to go to bed.
Tove is right.
Here you sit with liquor and ladies
and everything... and you shout.
But what's the outcome?
No mention of promiscuity.
You want that?
Yes.
Why not?
Such a lack of tact...
Because you all want to, right?
The Gods must know why.
It's always the same.
Who's who?
And where's the difference?
- Yes, yes...
Why did he have to come?
How about a song? Shouldn't we sing?
In the old times they could sing.
<i>The old days have come to an end</i>
<i>like rivers into the great sea,</i>
<i>and where the weak now rests,</i>
<i>who found the strong and his grave;</i>
<i>to defy it and the grave</i>
<i>we shall succeed in with God's aid.</i>
I'll help you.
Do you want a schnapps?
No, thanks.
I don't drink.
Liquor is healthy
when you're growing...
The rest of us use it
to postpone sclerosis.
And I thought I had
a stomach ache today...
Help me clear table instead.
Oh, fuck that table.
A bunch of bastards, huh?
What about yourself?
Yes, yes.
You're all so damn aggressive.
Who?
We are.
- Well...
Sit down and be young.
Oh, what's that?
No...
I can't find the stupid switch.
- I can't find Ilse. Ilse?
Since you don't want to help wash up,
you can at least get glasses and cognac.
I said cognac.
Bring out the oil lamp.
Elisabet, glasses.
Stop it.
And you can just fuck off...
Why is that idiot here?
We need a bombing now, right?
That's just what you need.
A lot of machines coming roaring in
from the sea, and thundering grenades.
And all of us seeking cover.
Or running like rabbits.
Protecting our children.
Or putting a paper over the head.
No, not a paper over the head...
rather a really old-fashioned attack -
with TNT and blockbuster bombs.
Large metal objects with explosives
inside, that you can truly sense.
There's only the thing, we don't have
any other fun than what we create.
You're all so bloody preachy tonight.
What would you do during a bombing?
Run as fast as possible!
Then what's it good for?
- Experiencing something.
Something fun.
A blast.
I think we experiencing enough.
- Yes, miss.
The times are so filled with
chances for those experiences, -
that you would rather avoid them.
Certainly, assistant professor.
But just to be forced to run with your
pants down; perhaps you could save some?
Or kill someone, or snuff it yourself?
What do you think?
Lying with a fine hole in yourself,
and blood in your mouth; like in movies.
Someone bending over you with soft lips
and saying: "Oh!", and lots of feelings.
Nah...
Then what is this
morphine treatment we undertaking?
All this good acid we're pouring down.
Is it only for the benefit of the state?
Or the hospital service later on, when
you'll have your kidneys ripped out?
Or a waiting liver, black and lumpy;
no larger than the hand of a child.
That's only on the surface.
- On the surface?
Then what is it,
we can expect from your rich inner?
What do you replace
the superficiality with?
This genteel arousal where you continue
the game without damaging the crockery?
And no one notices
that you're plastered senseless.
Do you want to go out?
- Well done. I felt that bombing! Good.
You're dead drunk. Knud shouldn't drive.
- Never! Come on troublemakers!
Come on.
Drive!
I had to change.
Yes.
I'll come now.
God, I think we're missing one.
It's Jan.
He has fallen asleep.
Are you there?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Slept.
What's wrong, dear?
Nothing.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Very?
Oh, a bit.
Come on.
Yes.
- Should I help you?
No, thanks.
Come on, chubby.
How many are we?
- 1001.
Seven!
That's 21 kroner.
- 21?
Is that gentleman coming with you?
- Yes.
Well, it's 21 kroner.
- Here is 10 and 10 and 1.
There aren't really room in there.
We can bunch together.
There's room here.
That table is occupied.
- Occupied?
We can sit here till someone shows up.
- Of course...
...you get thirsty
from a drive like that.
We would like seven beers.
- I want a whisky instead.
I told you, that table is reserved!
- We'll just stay till someone turns up.
Excuse me.
- What did we do?
This country, this country...
We shouldn't let that affect us.
Waiter!
You have been told, there's no room.
Let's go.
- Why isn't the lady seemly dressed.
I think she's absolutely seemly dressed.
Perhaps I'm not seemly dressed either?
- No.
He doesn't think,
I'm seemly dressed either.
It's better we get the beers
and a whisky for me.
Leave the room voluntarily,
or you'll be taken away.
That gentleman is very intoxicated.
- What?
This isn't a place for all and sundry.
He says: "This isn't a place
for <i>all and sundry</i>."
You're very provocative!
Give us six... no...
give seven us beers.
Don't serve that company.
- No.
If you don't want to serve us,
we'll settle for what we brought along.
Let go!
Let go of him!
There.
Now we have him.
Come on, little bull.
<i>Toro, toro...</i>
What is this?!
Come, hurry.
What is it?
Nothing.
Are you sorry, that I came along?
Yes.
Are you drunk?
A bit.
I'm a lot.
Lars.
I don't want to go back.
Your justification?
I don't want to.
- No.
We won't discuss our feelings about it.
- No.
That's very independent, right?
Do you love me?
As it's called...
No.
Come.
You know it can't be...
Come.
Come on anyway.
You're very unhappy.
Oh, shut up.
I'm very unhappy.
You can't say that nowadays, right?
You can't be it, right?
Hey, champ, you forgot to pay.
This isn't free.
Don't address me like that.
- Well.
How much.
- For you, sir, 4 kroner.
Thank you.
You need 1 krone in return.
Wait, man,
you need 1 krone in return!
I said 4 kroner, sir.
This is a proper business.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away!
Can't you understand it?
Do you want to continue?
- No.
They have left.
Has Ilse left?
Yes, together with Knud.
Are you prudish?
You look so ridiculous.
What about Knud?
- He went along.
Where are the others?
- Ugh, you smell.
At some point you always behave
like kids: puke, smell and cry for mom.
I often wonder why
I have to carry around the babies?
Stop.
- Who has the car keys?
Lars.
- I want to go home.
Where's Ilse?
She's fornicating with Knud
in the forest.
Then let's find them!
We can't just lie here and do nothing.
He's...
He's your husband?
Do you want to rush into the forest and
find them. And then watch them do it?
They can find their way home
if they want to?
Stop your cynicism, Bet.
- Don't be a mess.
But what are they doing in the forest?
I have told you. They're fornicating.
What about Knud? He's... he's...
- What is he?
You're married after all?
I know we've often discussed it;
we believe a lot, but I can't stand it.
And Tanja!
Tanja came out from there!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Your husband!
Won't you do it with me soon?
- Yes, Knud.
You want to.
Then what the hell are you afraid of?
That the grass is too cold?
You're not as romantic now as earlier.
Just shut up.
That's what we can't.
- What can't we?
Freeze a sentiment, can't you see it?
Initially you're carried away
and there's a potential in everything.
When something comes of it,
we can't do it; we don't do it.
It's because we talk too much.
I'm married to Jan and have a child.
I'm no longer drunk, it's cold,
and I'm almost naked.
Can't you see it?
Here you stand with a girl you like, -
which you also feel, wants to -
and then after all she won't.
- You could try.
I have tried.
- Help yourself, dinner is ready.
D. H. Lawrence,
Love Among the Haystacks.
You're like Bet.
- What's she doing here?
Ilse.
Ilse.
Just think about me.
I'm not doing anything else.
- Remember, you're the seducer.
I'm cold.
- Shall I warm you?
It's stinging.
Ilse. Ilse. Ilse.
Yes, teacher.
Oh, no.
You mustn't say that.
Why not?
Don't teachers have a sex life?
Dear God.
You're alright.
Why do I necessitate such seriousness?
- So does passion.
I can't. I can't without.
- It's so demanding.
Please keep silent.
Make me.
That's better.
Remember, you're the seducer.
Now I can.
Do you love me?
- Yes, yes, yes.
Do you think Tanja is asleep?
No.
What happened, Knud?
What was wrong, my friend?
Knud.
What happened?
What are you supposed to do? Should you
yell or scream... or hit someone?
Can't you see it?
Here's a spot with
a merry-go-round and a pub.
Two hours... or four hours ago
it was filled with people -
who drivelled, sweat and drank.
Now they lie at home and snore,
or dream, or sweat, or fornicate.
They'll wake up with a headache.
Even though they feel like shit,
they're ready to try it all again.
We're the same!
- Why not?
Because it's too lousy,
it's too bloody lousy!
It isn't enough!
Something has to happen.
A development, results,
you want to try other feelings.
A small measly itching,
that itches, -
which you scratch, but that continue
to itch without exciting or annoying.
It's disgusting!
Disgusting!
It isn't like that, Lars.
It just isn't so fierce.
You can't insist on great fluctuations.
It's childish.
- Childish?!
When can see you how it all is?
We never get closer to each other.
We only fool around a lot.
While those we despise
pull us around by the noses.
The shit is going to hell
and we're stuck and can only watch!
It's horrible.
You go through foolish situations
just to feel something happening.
That you mean something.
Yes, I do understand it.
But we have been placed.
It has happened.
- But it hasn't.
You only delude yourself it's over:
"Things are also good", right?
The spot, the pub, that scarf-guy, Jan,
Bet, Ilse with her bra, stomach ache.
More should be able to come of it!
Things should be able to change.
It's foolish, I know.
I think this is good.
I love you tonight.
I don't have strength to change anyone,
neither myself.
Lars, Lars,
I thought we were adults.
Yes.
Yes.
We are, thank God.
Then we're exempt from
making more stupidities.
Exempt from making more stupidities!
It's not as much fun as before.
Are you cold?
- No, not any longer.
Can we talk about it?
Of course we can.
Then we can talk about liquor,
Shakespeare...
And then I can be a real teacher.
And cite in English.
- What?
From Macbeth, you know.
Where the porter talks about
the influence of wine on love-making.
<i>"It provokes the desire,</i>
<i>but it takes away the performance."</i>
Nonsense.
You're not in love with me.
- No.
Then what the hell are we doing?
- Nothing.
Dear God, I'm so sleepy.
It's late.
We ought to have something to eat now.
- Yes.
Are you sad?
What do you mean?
Ilse, do you want to marry me?
I meant it... in some way.
Do you want to go home?
- It's fine.
It's late.
I can sit on your lap.
- Yes.
We have to get home to the kids.
- Yes, we have to.
Room enough?
- Yes.
Then let's go.
Good morning.
Is mom asleep?
- Yes.
Then wake her up.
- No. Come here.
But mom should get up.
- Mom needs sleep.
Where's Lars?
- I don't know.
Oh, there he is.
- Good morning.
Do you want to go swimming?
- Mom has to come.
Of course.
Love.
Love.
Mom.
Yes, dear.
- We have to go swimming.
I kneel down, madam.
Move away so I can get up.
Now go away.
What time is it?
I don't know.
I'm thirsty.
Come on, mom.
Take the bully with you
so I can put my swimsuit on.
Come on.
The water tastes better
with ladies in it!
A dubious compliment!
Where did you go yesterday?
- Where did you go?
I searched for you.
- Who did you find?
Just a moment,
I'll see if it was any of you.
It wasn't me!
Wasn't it?
- See for yourself.
I don't have time.
I wasn't you either.
Was it because of me?
Can't I talk for a moment
without water in my mouth?
Have you ever done it in water?
- What?
Oh, give it a rest.
- No.
Yes, in a bathtub.
Supposedly it's beautiful to drown.
- Then drown.
Do you mean it?
- Yes.
Goodbye.
Wait for me, you stupid bitch.
It's all very happy and unhappy.
Did you say anything?
- Yes.
It wasn't you.
I can see it now.
It wasn't you unfortunately.
You sea lion.
You shouldn't drink so much.
It makes you stupid.
I wish I had a beer now.
- Good thing I don't drink liquor.
Is there anything left?
- Stop it. It's time for coffee.
Are you over it?
Was he very bad?
- Not so bad.
Apparently,
we can't talk together properly.
Where's Knud?
Go and find dad.
Not bad...
Good day, Knud.
No point in getting up.
We saw a car here yesterday,
so we thought Dr Mikkelsen was here.
So we had to visit today.
- Good day, Knud.
I told Helge it was intrusive...
How are your parents?
We ought to address Knud more formally.
He's adult now. We haven't met in years.
No, no...
- How old are you, Knud?
I'm 32.
- 32? Such an old blighter.
Unfortunately, mom and dad are not here.
I'm here with Bet.
We don't want to disturb you.
We'll list off again.
Well...
you have to say hello to the family.
Bet would... Bet would...
- Do you have children?
I would like to meet his children.
I've turned into a kind of grandfather.
Eh... there are also some others.
We're having guests, so -
perhaps it looks a bit...
- I told you we shouldn't burst in.
But just come in and say hello.
- Yes, please.
This is my wife Elisabet.
Good day, dear madam.
We're sorry to disturb you, but -
I'm an old friend of
Knud's father and when...
Yes, this is my wife. We're the Cornelius's.
We thought of
paying a visit to the doctor.
That's nice.
- And now we disturbing your idyll...
It's very lovely here.
- Yes, it's nice here.
Oh,
perhaps we ought to say cheers?
It was nice of you to visit us.
Yes, we hadn't expected this.
- Yes, very kind. We were just visiting.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Well, I don't know.
I haven't really given it any thought...
It doesn't matter.
You're all professionals after all?
Knud is part of the school system.
- No, I'm part of the school system.
I thought...
- Kjeld means I'm in high school.
And he's only in public school.
- Oh, I see.
There's almost no difference
after everything has become the same.
No.
What do you mean?
Well...
Are you're doing constructional work?
Yes, I'm a master builder.
- Master builder? You're so young?
Yes.
Does anyone want another schnapps?
- No, thanks. We've had enough.
You can handle small one?
Do you want one, Mr Cornelius?
- I won't say no.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
We've looked forward...
We've...
I mean...
After all we're not...
...I don't know how to say it...
entirely...
I think my husband means
that we're not...
Well, we're a two old blighters
but we still fit in here.
I remember how your father and I hunted
together and walked across the fields.
The sun rose in the sky.
Yes, it was a duck hunt.
Then to sit down at the morning table
with schnapps and hot coffee.
Yes, that was something.
Back then we were in shape.
Now...
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How was the weather back then?
The weather?
Yes... do you mean
that particular day or in general?
In general.
Oh, it was the same as now.
Almost.
Then what about the climatic change?
Yes, of course.
Meteorologically they can...
The important thing is
that the weather is good today.
Well said.
Well,
cheers for the meteorologists.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
I wonder where the kids are.
Perhaps Ilse...
I'll help you look.
They must be somewhere near.
More schnapps?
- No, thanks.
Oh well.
Cheers.
Cheers, Kjeld.
Where did Ilse go?
We must also say thank you for dinner.
- Yes, sure.
Thank you for dinner.
- Thank you very much.
I'll accompany you.
Bon appetit.
Yes, yes.
What "yes, yes"?
It was just a regular "yes, yes".
There's never enough hot water.
Where are they at?
They're at the public.
- The public?
The large beach.
We better go home soon.
Yes.
It's dead.
Ladies, we want ladies. We must
get to all of them, the entire beach.
I'm tired.
- Come on, boy. There's still time.
Why that mischief?
- What?
Can't you behave?
Why that mischief?
What mischief?
- You know what I mean.
Your kid?
- Yes, my son.
Whoops, watch out.
Look at that.
- Yes.
There's one of the right ones.
What's your name?
What do you do? How old are you?
What are your targets?
- Targets in life, or waist target?
Both.
- Go away.
We've come a whole mile to meet you.
- Hands off.
They're pretty...
- Go away, or I'll scream for help.
Scream.
Scream.
That's better.
It's those two.
Do you disturb people in public?
What is going on here?
- They came suddenly.
Should we call the police.
- That's not necessary!
Why can't you keep to yourself?
Why must you bring your mischief here?
Why can't you behave.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
What happened?
What has happened?
Tanja, what did he do?
What did Kjeld do?
What is this?
Kjeld?
What about Kjeld?
- Something with Birthe. Go inside.
Did he try to play tricks on her?
- Go.
Did he try to play tricks on Birthe?
Did he?
- Don't, Jan. That won't make it better.
That cheap bitch.
I already knew you were a louse.
- Stop it. What is this?
Who are you?
Keep away.
What are you doing?
Jan, think about what you're doing.
Think about yourself.
What did you do yesterday?
- Keep away.
Keep away!
Take your hands off!
What's going on?
What right do you have to interfere?
Just stop. I don't have the right to
interfere in anything, but don't fight.
It's too foolish.
I don't give a fuck about you!
Fuck all of you!
I don't want to.
It's unbearable.
