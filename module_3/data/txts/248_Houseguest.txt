<b>- $50,000.
- What?</b>
<b>That's right, interest

<b>Go ahead and speculate...

<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>Spit it out! What

<b>He's not happy.</b>
<b>And when he's not happy,

<b>We want to keep Happy

<b>That's right.</b>
<b>Now, the way I see it...</b>
<b>correct me

<b>"A," we give you

<b>I'm gonna go with "A."</b>

<b>You can't do this

<b>[Laughs]</b>
<b>Boy, oh, boy,
you have changed!</b>
<b>You used to be so uptight
when we were kids.</b>
<b>You used to lecture us
on bicycle safety.</b>
<b>I haven't been the same</b>
<b>since...
since the accident.</b>
<b>What accident?</b>
<b>I was scuba diving
in the Cayman Islands</b>
<b>with my friends,</b>
<b>and... we're out there
looking for stingray,</b>
<b>and all of a sudden,
two great white sharks
came out of nowhere...</b>
<b>bam! ...just attacked us,</b>
<b>and it was... it was...
it was vicious!</b>
<b>It was like a scene
out of "Jaws."</b>
<b>There was just bloods
and bubbles and butts,
and everything was...</b>
<b>and then I saw him
bite my friend!</b>
<b>His head came off,
and his eye was on me!</b>
<b>His eye was on me!</b>
<b>Oh, God! Oh!</b>
<b>Easy!</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>Oh, my God.</b>
<b>[Gasps]</b>
<b>[Sighs] I'm okay.</b>
<b>[Sniffles]</b>
<b>[Exhales deeply]</b>
<b>Well, this is great.</b>
<b>Yeah... this is great.</b>
<b>I mean,
this is really great.</b>
<b>I can't believe,
after all these years,</b>
<b>it only took one
phone call to get
your butt to Pittsburgh</b>
<b>so we could rekindle
that old friendship.</b>
<b>Well, you know
what they say, uh, Gary,</b>
<b>uh, friends
don't grow on trees.</b>
<b>No, they don't.</b>
<b>Oh, remember how we always
used to sing the song?</b>
<b>♫ Good night, Irene,

<b>- My wife?
- Yeah.</b>
<b>Um... she's dead, Gary.</b>
<b>What?!</b>
<b>I just spoke to her
yesterday.</b>
<b>I mean,
she's dead inside,</b>
<b>um, from the loss
of our son.</b>
<b>Your son?!
I thought he's at Princeton!</b>
<b>That's what it means,
see?</b>
<b>W- We... we thought
we lost our son
to the lvy League.</b>
<b>Ohh.
[Laughing] Oh.</b>
<b>We just misplaced him
momentarily.</b>
<b>You misplaced a person
momentarily?!</b>
<b>- I guess we did.
- If I don't get that money</b>
<b>by the conclusion
of this holiday weekend,</b>
<b>I'm gonna be pissed.</b>
<b>Oh, no,
don't be pissed.</b>
<b>Hold it.

<b>- $ 1 million!
- Hello?</b>
<b>Listen, goddamn it,
I want Franklin, or
you're gonna be looking</b>
<b>at the wrong end
of an ice pick...</b>
<b>- Oh, God!

<b>Now, let me introduce you</b>

<b>But first, let me tell you
a few things about Derek.</b>
<b>He has come a long way
to talk to us today,</b>
<b>and he has had
a distinguished career</b>

<b>[Laughs]</b>
<b>A professional in his field,</b>

<b>- Um...
- [Laughs] Yeah!</b>
<b>Man; Sit down!</b>
<b>Ooh! I had some notes.
Um, I need to go to the car.</b>
<b>I had some notes.
If I go get those notes...</b>
<b>I think we should
let the man with the
high-water pants go first</b>
<b>'cause his pants
are getting very short.</b>
<b>- [Laughter]
- Oh, Derek, you know
you're just joking.</b>
<b>You know your secretary</b>
<b>has sent all your slides
ahead of you.</b>
<b>- Oh, she did?
- Yes.</b>
<b>- Harvey, will you start
the slide show, please?
- Yes.</b>
<b>Here is your clicker,</b>

you know what to say.</b>
<b>- We'll click 'em.
- That's it!</b>
<b>Thanks. Thanks, Harv.</b>

- Oh!
- Oh!</b>
<b>Ooh! I wonder

<b>[Both laugh]</b>
<b>That looks like the inside

<b>[Laughs] What is it?</b>
<b>Oh! Ah!</b>
<b>Oh! Ooh! Oh!</b>
<b>Oh! Oh! Oh!
Someone get the lights!</b>
<b>- [Laughs]
- [Applause]</b>
<b>Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.</b>
<b>I think you've learned
all that I could teach you
about my career.</b>
<b>It's time to have
Dr. Von Fleisenberg,</b>
<b>who is the leading
hair-transplant scientist
in the country,</b>
<b>to discuss...</b>
<b>[Laughs] Dr. Derek.</b>
<b>Thank you,
Professor Von whatever,</b>
<b>but I'm sure we have time
for just one question.</b>
<b>Oh, yes, Mr. Ichabod,</b>
<b>the head of
our science department.</b>
<b>Uh, in Chapter Five
of your book,</b>
<b>you said
there are many things</b>
<b>you would do differently</b>
<b>if you could
do them over again.</b>
<b>What did you mean
by that?</b>
<b>- Uh, Chapter Five?
- In your book.</b>
<b>What I meant by that
when I put that in there</b>
<b>was that, um, I padded
the book immensely.</b>
<b>I probably would
eliminate Chapter Five</b>
<b>and have gone
straight to Six.</b>
<b>I wrote it 'cause
you have to have Five
to get to Six.</b>
<b>You don't have the
slightest idea of what
you're talking about, do you?</b>
<b>- What... listen here!
- [Microphone feedback]</b>
<b>So, if you know so much
about what I do,</b>
<b>since you know
more than I do,</b>
<b>then why don't you
come up here,</b>
<b>Mr. Smarty-pants,
Mr. "I don't have a woman"?!</b>
<b>- Well, I, uh...
- Why don't you come
up here and tell me,</b>
<b>Mr. Ichybody.</b>
<b>I'm waiting.
Hmm? Hmm?</b>
<b>- I-I-I'm sorry.
- [Cheers and applause]</b>
<b>You are sorry.
And pass out those
copies of my books.</b>
<b>By the way,
there's a free ticket</b>
<b>for the Pearl Jam concert
inside each one of those books.</b>
<b>[Cheers]</b>
<b>Hey, hey, hey!</b>
<b>That was a great speech,
Derek.</b>
<b>Well, you know,

<b>Your secretary faxed us

<b>I mean, talking to

<b>[Scoffs]</b>
<b>Hmm. Comfortable.</b>
<b>[Chuckles softly]</b>
<b>Who's insecure?</b>

<b>You said, "He's secure."</b>

<b>Pauly; That's right.

<b>at the expense

<b>- like Edgar Allan Poe,

- [Slurping]</b>

<b>I don't think it
would kill us to
spend some together,</b>

<b>- Don't you agree, Derek?
- Mm.</b>
<b>[Slurping]</b>
<b>Um... [Squeals]</b>
<b>[Squeals] I...</b>
<b>[Talking with mouth full]
I think that family togetherness
is very important.</b>
<b>This isn't fair.</b>
<b>You're all ganging
up against me.
You always do this!</b>
<b>Why can't you
just be normal?!</b>
<b>I can't stand them.
I hate them.</b>
<b>But then again...</b>
<b>Derek, I'm sorry you had to
bear witness to this.</b>
<b>Look, everybody,</b>
<b>we can all do whatever
we want today,</b>
<b>but tomorrow
it's family solidarity day,</b>
<b>and we're all spending it
with our best buddy Derek.</b>
<b>- [Gasps]
- [Silverware clanks]</b>
<b>This is the best breakfast,</b>

<b>- Derek was the best

<b>- Could you teach me

<b>Gary, I can't believe

<b>Hey, guys, w-w-what kind
of golf is this, man?</b>
<b>I mean, this is...
this is boring.</b>
<b>We need to speed
the game up, man.
You ever play speed golf?</b>
<b>Yeah. No, I've heard
of that.</b>
<b>It's like speed chess,
right?</b>
<b>There you go, man.
You right on time, man.</b>
<b>You know everything.
Come on.</b>
<b>Everybody,
we tee up at the same time.</b>
<b>Jump in the cars,
we leave...
now, it doesn't count</b>
<b>unless we all hit the ball
at the same time, all right?</b>
<b>Don't look at anybody
next to you.</b>
<b>This is a great game.
You ready?</b>
<b>On the count of 3.
This is gonna be great.</b>
<b>1...</b>
<b>2...</b>
<b>3.</b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>[All grunt]</b>
<b>Don; That's the shot, huh?</b>
<b>- Gary; Nice shot, Mr. Pike.
- Tough break, Chip.</b>
<b>Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.</b>
<b>Leave the drink.
Come on, you're not a caddie.</b>
<b>- Men's...
- There he is.
There he is.</b>
<b>Show us the course.
Show us the course.</b>
<b>Oh, of course, the course.</b>
<b>[Up-tempo music plays]</b>
<b>Whoo-hoo!</b>
<b>Gary; Roller coaster!</b>
<b>Kevin; Come on.
Let's go.</b>
<b>[Tires screech]</b>
<b>♫ Speed golf ♫</b>
<b>[Evil laughter]</b>
<b>Ha! Ha!</b>
<b>- Come on!
- Wait for me!</b>
<b>Whoo-hoo! Let's go!</b>
<b>♫ Speed golf ♫</b>
<b>[Tires screech]</b>
<b>Speed golf!</b>
<b>Let's go, man.
Go. Go!</b>
<b>Where's your ball?</b>
<b>Hit the ball!</b>
<b>[Grunting]</b>
<b>Don; Come on, Ron!</b>
<b>Kevin; Come on.
Let's go.</b>
<b>Hit 'em, hit 'em,

<b>Whoa!</b>
<b>[Tires screech]</b>
<b>[Indistinct shouting]</b>
<b>[Tires screech]</b>
<b>Ow-oooo-gaaahhh!</b>
<b>- Ha ha ha!
- Whoa, yay!</b>
<b>Stuart; Boy, this is a treat.
This is our ninth hole.</b>
<b>Notice the slight dogleg
on the right.</b>
<b>Yep. Quite a little history
here.</b>
<b>At the '72 Open,</b>
<b>Arnold Palmer made
a hole in one.</b>
<b>I was just a boy, but...</b>
<b>Oh, yeah?</b>
<b>It made quite
an impact on my life.</b>
<b>Make it stop, Joey.</b>
<b>- Wh-o-o-o-oa!
- Good riddance.</b>
<b>- There he goes, Pauly!
- Oh, yeah.</b>
<b>Hey! Hey!</b>
<b>This could affect
your membership!</b>
<b>That's him!</b>
<b>[Gasps]</b>
<b>Whoa!
What are you doing?!</b>
<b>Kevin; Speed golf.
We can skip holes 3 to 6.</b>
<b>Hold on, guys!</b>
<b>[Don laughing]</b>
<b>Ooh!</b>
<b>Gary; Whoa!
We lost Pike!</b>
<b>[Tires screech]</b>
<b>Pauly; Joey! Joey! Joey!</b>
<b>Oooooohhhh!</b>
<b>Stop them!
Stop that cart!</b>
<b>Both: Whoooooaa!</b>
<b>Uh! Oh!</b>
<b>Must be some more guys
playing speed golf.</b>
<b>Make it stop!
I can't stop!</b>
<b>Man; Pull!</b>
<b>[Gunshots]</b>
<b>Hold it! They're shooting
at us, Pauly!</b>
<b>- Pike... Pike...
- [Groans]</b>
<b>You all right?
You all right?</b>
<b>[Chuckling]
I think my damn tooth
is broken.</b>
<b>- This man needs a dentist.
Ron, check him out.
- Why don't you?
- Yeah.</b>
<b>This is Pennsylvania.
T- This is out of
my jurisdiction.</b>
<b>L- I could lose my license.</b>
<b>Nah, you're
the world-renowned dentist.</b>
<b>- You check him out.
- Well...</b>
<b>- I'll just watch.
- Well, fine, then.</b>
<b>Let a real dentist
go to work.</b>
<b>Just step back, please.
Everybody, just step back.</b>
<b>This man needs air!</b>
<b>He could have a heart attack.
I've seen it before.</b>
<b>Oh, this is...
this is bad.</b>
<b>- This is bad.
Say "aaah."
- Aaahh.</b>
<b>Oh! This is bad.</b>
<b>This man needs a Tic Tac!</b>
<b>Anybody have a Tic Tac,
please?!</b>
<b>Do you think maybe the tooth
needs to come out?</b>
<b>- Well, what do you
think, doctor?
- I asked you first.</b>
<b>See, that's why
I have more papers</b>
<b>published in the journal,
like maybe 50...</b>
<b>no, 70 in the last year
to be exact,</b>
<b>because I can make
a diagnosis. You know
what I'm saying?</b>
<b>Okay. I-I'll look
at him, okay?</b>
<b>[Groaning]</b>
<b>Ohh.</b>
<b>Ewwww.</b>
<b>- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>This man has a date
with the tooth fairy,
people!</b>
<b>Appears to be
a horizontal fracture</b>
<b>with a periapical infection,
a fistula draining,</b>
<b>and pulpal necrosis.</b>
<b>I think this man needs
a root amputation</b>
<b>to avoid periodontal
ligament trauma.</b>
<b>And if I were doing it,</b>
<b>I'd administer 7.2 CC's
of X ylocaine</b>
<b>- with epinephrine.
- Mm.</b>
<b>But... [Sighs]</b>
<b>Tch.</b>
<b>What do you think?</b>
<b>Well, let me see that,
doctor.</b>
<b>Yeah, okay.</b>
<b>Yes, that's much better
than tying a string
to a doorknob</b>
<b>and just slamming it shut.</b>
<b>[Laughter]</b>
<b>- Ah, ha, ha.
- Yes, Brenda?</b>
<b>Dr. Timmerman...</b>
<b>before you get started,
uh, you have a visitor.</b>
<b>Ah, good.</b>
<b>[Giggles]</b>
<b>I'll...
I'll be right back.</b>
<b>Mmm. Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>Uh, you might want
to just get washed up
first.</b>
<b>Brenda...</b>
<b>Go.
You're embarrassing me.</b>
<b>Do your thing, Derek.</b>
<b>Hey, Gary!</b>
<b>Hee hee hee hee.</b>
<b>[Moans]</b>
<b>Gonna get clean now.</b>
<b>[Humming]</b>
<b>We want Franklin.
We want Franklin.</b>
<b>- Franklin's up.
He slams. Uhh!
- Ah.</b>
<b>- [Gasps]
- Have I got a surprise
for you.</b>
<b>- Dr. Walter Kraft!
- Who?</b>
<b>Walter Kraft...</b>
<b>University of Pittsburgh
Dental School.</b>
<b>- He's here with his class.
- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>Walter...</b>
<b>I asked him to come over
and watch the procedure.</b>
<b>Oh, that's... you're...
that's great.</b>
<b>Yeah, when he heard
that you were coming,</b>
<b>they all just
piled in the van
and came right over.</b>
<b>- Good.
- You do remember Walter,
don't you?</b>
<b>Kinda. You know...</b>
<b>Oh. Sure... I mean,
he must have been teaching</b>
<b>when you went
through the program.</b>
<b>Teach... oh.
I was in independent studies.</b>
<b>Brenda!</b>
<b>- So advanced, I didn't
have to go to class.
- Ohh.</b>
<b>Would you go get some more
topical anesthetic, please?</b>
<b>Excuse me.</b>
<b>No. No.</b>
<b>No. No. [Cries]
Not now.</b>
<b>Wake up. Come on.</b>
<b>- Shh. Shh.
It's okay. Shh.
- [Mumbling]</b>
<b>- All right. All right.
- [Mumbling]</b>
<b>Will you just shut up?!</b>
<b>[Door opens]</b>
<b>They're here.</b>
<b>- He's ready.
- Brenda; Follow
Dr. Timmerman.</b>
<b>Come on.
Step in, everybody.
Come along.</b>
<b>Come. Come.
Hey.</b>
<b>Uh, it is my pleasure
to introduce to you
Dr. Derek Bond.</b>
<b>[Applause]</b>
<b>Woman; Doctor...</b>
<b>My brother.</b>
<b>- What's up?
- Ha.</b>
<b>Dr. Kraft...
what do you have to say
to your most famous student?</b>
<b>Put on a little weight, eh?</b>
<b>Ha ha ha ha!</b>
<b>[Laughter]</b>
<b>So, now that, uh, Dr. Bond
has anesthetized the patient,</b>
<b>- I will remove the maxillary
right upper lateral incisor.
- Excuse me.</b>
<b>Would it be possible
for us</b>
<b>to see Dr. Bond
perform the procedure?</b>
<b>All: Yay!</b>
<b>Oh, that's
an excellent idea.</b>
<b>Me? Oh, no, no, no.
Stop.</b>
<b>Thanks, my brother...
the thing is,</b>
<b>with all these malpractice
suits running around,</b>
<b>I get a headache</b>
<b>just thinking about working
without a license</b>
<b>in another state.</b>
<b>Derek, come on.</b>
<b>Here, stick your mitts
right in there.</b>
<b>- Ahh.
- Yeah!</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Right in there.</b>
<b>Well...
let's get to work.</b>
<b>- Yes.
- Ohh!</b>
<b>Dr. Kraft; Oh.</b>
<b>All right.</b>
<b>Never be ashamed
to use two hands.</b>
<b>And I have small hands,
so I had to develop</b>
<b>the Derek Bond's
2- handed grip.</b>
<b>Take your time.
Always take your time.</b>
<b>Sometimes, you just want
to make sure they're asleep.</b>
<b>Always touch them
to reassure that
you're their friend.</b>
<b>I'm your friend.
I'm your friend.</b>
<b>- Mmm.
- Get the thing here.</b>
<b>- [Whirring]
- Whoa-ho!</b>
<b>Heh.</b>
<b>[Indistinct cheering]</b>
<b>- Yeah, Derek!
- Wow.</b>
<b>Kevin; Thank you.
Thank you.</b>
<b>Thank you.
Thank you.</b>
<b>I want a list of every member
who stepped foot on this golf
course today.</b>
<b>- You hear me?
- Every member!</b>
<b>[Stuart whimpering]</b>
<b>There it is!
Just... give me it!</b>
<b>He's on this list,
and it's gonna take us
right to him.</b>
<b>[Muffled screaming]</b>
<b>When I was a kid
and things got me down,</b>
<b>[Talking with mouth full]
I'd come down here
with one of these,</b>
<b>and inevitably, things
wouldn't seem so bad anymore.</b>
<b>[Birds chirping]</b>
<b>There's a lot of opportunity
in frozen yogurt.</b>
<b>- Uh-huh.
- It's a big field, right?</b>
<b>- Uh-huh.
- A Beaver Meadows product</b>
<b>won't really affect
Emily's Yogurt Madness.</b>
<b>A little healthy competition
might be good for her.</b>
<b>It'll keep her
on her toes, right?</b>
<b>[Inhales sharply,
coughing]</b>
<b>Derek...</b>
<b>what about your diet?</b>
<b>I have weaknesses.
I have weaknesses.</b>
<b>I try to fight them,
but sometimes they get
the best of me.</b>
<b>Please don't judge me
for this.</b>
<b>Judge you?</b>
<b>I'm glad to see
you're not perfect.</b>
<b>[Bag crinkles]</b>
<b>It makes me feel
a little better
about myself.</b>
<b>You got some fries
in that bag?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.</b>
<b>Thank you, man.</b>
<b>[Laughing]</b>
<b>You know, it's funny how
much simpler things seemed</b>
<b>when we were kids.</b>
<b>Those were the days,

<b>Those were the days.</b>

<b>Yeah, Dad, I thought

- We were outside.</b>
<b>We agreed that you would do it

<b>How come I'm the one

<b>What about that

<b>I see you're really

<b>- Suddenly,

<b>- Just go already, Dad.

<b>Dry this here...</b>
<b>Derek?</b>
<b>Maybe you wouldn't mind...</b>
<b>Please, Derek.</b>

<b>Gary, you know

<b>- [Coughs]
- Wow.</b>
<b>[Humming]</b>
<b>And your firm is going to

<b>- I didn't know that.
- Who do you think

<b>Uh, Jerry?</b>
<b>- Yeah, I think it's Jerry.
- Your best friend
at the firm?</b>
<b>Don't you think
Jerry would've called me?</b>
<b>- [Telephone ringing]
- I mean, Beaver Meadows

swallow us alive.</b>
<b>Did you know the last thing

he died was broccoli?</b>
<b>Then don't eat it.</b>
<b>I can't believe
Jerry would do that to us.</b>
<b>Mom, Dad, Derek taught me

<b>- W...
- Left turns are tough

<b>[Chuckles]
It's... um, we were...</b>
<b>Derek, it's for you.

<b>Cool.</b>
<b>[Silverware rattles]</b>
<b>O- Oh.

<b>Um, it was gonna be

<b>I'm tellin' you, man, this is

<b>Well, I just...

<b>Look, Derek...
about Emily and this

<b>I just want you

<b>I had never lied

<b>[Brooke shouting]</b>
<b>Please, timeout!</b>
<b>You know... man, you know,
right before Anne Sexton

<b>she asked her daughter

<b>"Rats live on no evil star"

<b>[Voice breaking]
That's a major thing to ask.</b>
<b>I mean, they must've
had an amazing

<b>[Crying] Not like us!</b>
<b>Forget it! I'm never
talking to any of
you guys ever again!</b>
<b>What did you say to her?</b>
<b>Nothing.
I didn't say anything.</b>
<b>I'm her mother.

<b>[Sighs]</b>
<b>Derek...</b>
<b>you seem to have...

<b>Maybe you could talk

<b>Yeah. No problem.

<b>Oh!</b>

<b>[Music continues]</b>
<b>[Sobs]</b>
<b>W... W... I'm sorry.</b>
<b>L- I shouldn't have been
telling jokes.</b>
<b>I'm sorry.
I say something wrong?</b>
<b>[Crying] No.</b>
<b>It's... my dad and mom
and [Sobs]</b>
<b>And Steve doesn't love me
anymore.</b>
<b>Steve.
Are you sure?</b>
<b>Yes. But he's been...
he's been, like,</b>
<b>hanging in town every day
with Kelly Friedlander,</b>
<b>and [Sobs]
She's a lot prettier than me.</b>
<b>And you know...
I don't know, Derek.</b>
<b>It just...
it really hurts.</b>
<b>Oh, come here.</b>
<b>Listen.
Listen... listen to me, okay?</b>
<b>I can't see any woman
being finer than you.</b>
<b>I mean,
you are a beautiful woman,</b>
<b>and you got it going on,
all right?</b>
<b>You're just with
the wrong guy.</b>
<b>I mean, none of the women
I've ever dated</b>
<b>would put up with his mess.</b>
<b>No?</b>
<b>Oh, no, no, no, no.
No way, no how.</b>
<b>[Snaps fingers]
See ya.</b>
<b>Look, maybe you could
just kill him for me.</b>
<b>[Laughs]</b>
<b>You're playin', right?</b>
<b>You're playin', right?</b>
<b>Look... this guy
is a slime bag,
and you know that.</b>
<b>And I know there's a lot of
other guys who'd like to be
dating you right now.</b>
<b>And there's got to be
some guys that you're
interested in.</b>
<b>I know there's
another guy out there
somewhere, right?</b>
<b>[Sighs]
Well, there's Charles.</b>
<b>See? I knew... look,
I knew you had some
other guy in your pocket.</b>
<b>Now,
tell me about Charles.</b>
<b>Charles Baudelaire.</b>
<b>He's the great poet
of moral decay.</b>
<b>[Voice breaking]
He would definitely
understand me.</b>
<b>[Sobs]</b>
<b>Look, you got to get over
this thing for dead guys.</b>
<b>I mean, why don't we try
s- some live guys?</b>
<b>W... Charles Barkley.</b>
<b>- What?
- H-He's like a poet?</b>
<b>You ever seen his commercials?
All right?</b>
<b>Now, look, when I come back,
I promise you we're gonna
work on that dead-guy
thing, all right?</b>
<b>We're gonna get you
out there and get you to
movies with guys who are
still breathing, okay?</b>
<b>And we'll get you
some pastel colors...
at least some dark grays.</b>

<b>Kevin; I'm so glad

<b>Don't make any sense.

<b>What kind of man... this is

<b>Too many pillows. Take all day

<b>- So, who's Kevin Franklin?
- Kevin Franklin?</b>
<b>Yeah. I heard you

<b>You busted me.</b>
<b>Kevin Franklin is

<b>I mean, you... you

<b>Well, yes.
Actually, I have.</b>
<b>[Chuckles]</b>
<b>I often fantasize

<b>Oh, the things

<b>Pain in my neck.</b>
<b>Pay attention.</b>
<b>[Latch clicks]</b>
<b>Oh [Chuckles]
Hello, little girl.</b>
<b>Is there a tall black man

<b>- No!

<b>- Run for your lives!

<b>Ooh! Smashed him!</b>
<b>What is it now?</b>

<b>[Up-tempo music plays]</b>
<b>[Clicks]</b>
<b>[Click, gunshot]</b>
<b>Whoa.</b>
<b>- Watch TV.
- [Music plays on television]</b>
<b>- What was that?
- What was that boom?</b>
<b>Two bad men came to the door,

<b>[Music continues]</b>
<b>Um, I'm going

<b>I'm really good

<b>[Chuckles]</b>
<b>- [Barking]

<b>[Engine turns over]</b>
<b>[Car door closes]</b>
<b>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</b>
<b>What happened
to your eye, Larry?
Let me see that.</b>
<b>- [Laughing]
What happened to you?
- Some people just don't
appreciate good art.</b>
<b>[Laughing]
I guess not.</b>
<b>So...</b>
<b>where's you wants me
to drive, Miss Daisy?</b>
<b>Real funny, man.
Just keep driving.</b>
<b>- It's not my fault
you're in trouble, man.
I'm just trying to help.
- Yeah, right.</b>
<b>You know, Kevin, one day
you're gonna realize that
friendship is about

<b>But all you do is take...
take, take, take!</b>
<b>Hey, man, where'd you get
those shoes from?
Those are nice.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>[Angelic music plays]</b>
<b>- Stop the car, man.
- Stop the car?</b>
<b>Stop the car!</b>
<b>Stop the car now!</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>This makes sense now,
brother. I'm telling you,
it makes sense, man.</b>
<b>Look, you know,
Poseidon was an orphan, too.</b>
<b>Thank you.
Can we go now, Kevin?</b>
<b>I came here
with a class one time,
and Sister Mary Winters
was trippin'.</b>
<b>Do you know
what the only difference
between him and me is?</b>
<b>He's Greek, he's white,
and he's a god.</b>
<b>He never tried
to pass himself off
as somebody he wasn't.</b>
<b>Man,
that was a down brother.</b>
<b>Kevin... thank you
for that remarkable insight!
Now, can we go?!</b>
<b>I bet you he never
let people down when they
were countin' on him.</b>
<b>Those two Italian brothers
come around here looking
for you again,</b>
<b>I swear to God
I don't even know you,
and I mean that.</b>
<b>Larry,
I got to go back, man.</b>
<b>What?! Why?!</b>
<b>The man's marriage
is in trouble, man.
I'm his oldest friend
in the world.</b>
<b>You're my oldest friend
in the world.</b>
<b>You're only pretendin'
to be his oldest friend
in the world!</b>
<b>So?
He's still in trouble.</b>
<b>And he's got
this daughter, Brooke.
Man, the girl is messed up.</b>
<b>- So what?
- I lied to
a 5-year-old child, man.</b>
<b>Look, I told her
I would be back, man.
You can mess a kid up, man.
I know.</b>
<b>Give me the keys.
I got to go.</b>
<b>- I don't want to talk
about it.
- Kevin... Kevin...
Kevin!</b>
<b>Kevin!
You lie to everybody, man.</b>
<b>You badger me,
you have me compromise
myself as an artist,</b>
<b>and you had me risk my life
to save you!</b>
<b>And this is
how you treat me?!
This is how you pay me back?!</b>
<b>Hey, brother,
forget about it, huh?
You forget it.</b>
<b>If you see me on
the other side of the street,
you just keep on steppin'!</b>
<b>I mean that, Kevin!</b>
<b>You don't get it, do you?</b>
<b>No.
No, I don't get it.</b>
<b>Why don't you tell me...
why the hell are you going
back there?!</b>
<b>You said it yourself, man.</b>
<b>All my life, man,
all I've ever done
is take, take, take.</b>
<b>Kevin... Kevin needs this.
Kevin needs this.
Kevin's gonna make
a million dollars.</b>
<b>Man, I thought if I made
some money, man,</b>
<b>that would change things...
how people thought
about me.</b>
<b>I could be somebody,
all right?</b>
<b>Well, I was wrong, man.</b>
<b>I learned something
these past few days, man.</b>
<b>It's about friendship...
about our friendship,</b>
<b>about the friendship
I made with that
family, man...</b>
<b>that's what it's about.</b>
<b>That's why
I got to go back, Larry.
I have to go back.</b>
<b>- I'll call you.
- All right.</b>
<b>You know, man,
relationships are
about give and take.</b>
<b>Now, I know
you see it my way.
It's about compromise, see?</b>
<b>- Look how
we're friends now.
- [Gulps]</b>
<b>We sit down
and enjoy a meal together.
That's what men are
supposed to do.</b>
<b>Now, you,
you like to chase women,
and me, I like to chase women.</b>
<b>But it's probably different,
'cause dogs, they don't even
have to ask permission.</b>
<b>You just run 'em down.
If the girl can't run,
that's your woman.</b>
<b>Want some cake?</b>
<b>Derek; Thank you for coming
in on a holiday like this.</b>
<b>I hope it wasn't too much
of an imposition.</b>
<b>[Chuckles] No.
No, it's...</b>
<b>Here you go, Dr. Bond.

<b>Say you're at home and

<b>- Right.

<b>- This is, like,

<b>Kind of scary, Gary.

<b>Oh, Gary, please.
