Can I help you?
I'm here to visit the founders
of this venerable institution...
Mr. Mutt Nutter
and Mr. Jeff Pfister.
The fine security staff
downstairs were kind enough
to give me directions
to the correct floor.
The floor is the only
thing you have correct.
You do not have an appointment,
nor are you carrying a package,
so you don't have any business here.
Quite right.
Your employers are
fortunate to have someone
with your skills guarding their privacy.
I don't respond to flattery.
Nor can you recognize sarcasm.
You need to turn around and
go back the way you came.
Mm. You need to take me
to your employers. Now.
You might as well ask
me to explain your hair.
How did you get past security
without an appointment?
I did something like this.
[RECITING SPELL IN LATIN]
My hair is an eternal mystery,
never to be fully understood.
Purple is for royalty,
dear, not middle management.
Did you put us in Outpost number Two?
Well, I thought if we had to do
any last-minute troubleshooting,
all the brains should be in one place.
So while the world is burning,
Johansson and Lawrence and
Theron are in the Bahamas...
and we're in West Virginia
with Professor Michio Kaku.
He's a brilliant guy.
So was Einstein, but if it's between him
and Marilyn Monroe, fuck
the theory of relativity.
I told ya, bro,
genetically superior caste,
necessary but boring.
Well, who's gonna be in Outpost Three?
'Cause Langdon wants his robot there.
What? He wants the
Battle Axe 9000 in Three?
Yeah, not only that, but
he wants us to wipe her SSD
so she doesn't remember
he's the Antichrist.
Well, he's the one with
the triple sixes, not us.
It's his show.
What a show it's going to be.
Who the fuck are you?!
Hey, how'd you get past Ms. Venable?
These little symbols are
Outposts for the survivors
of this little holocaust you're
so gleefully anticipating.
JEFF: It's not little, lady.
Yeah. Seven billion dead
in the first ten minutes...
starting with you.
[RECITING SPELL IN LATIN]
[PANTING]
Outpost Three... Where's it located?
[GRUNTS] It's some place
called the Hawthorne School.
He donated it 'cause it's
underground, naturally shielded.
I see.
Mr. St. Pierre Vanderbilt
will try to purchase four tickets
for himself and his family.
You'll accept his offer
and secure him a place at Outpost Three.
Is that clearly understood?
Mm-mmm. There are no spots left.
Make sure there are.
Planning the end of the world
over a box of hot wings.
I suppose I must get to the
most unpleasant part of my visit.
- What's that?
- The part where I have to leave
before killing you both.
Good day.

MALLORY: <i>A thousand nuclear bombs?</i>
How can we stop that?
We can't.
Michael's already too powerful.
He can counteract
anything we hope to try.
God, I finally find
my place in the world,
and now it's all gonna end.
I am not ready to die.
Oh, not to make it all about me.
Actually, it is all about you now.
Your father will be purchasing
tickets for you and your family
to inhabit one of the
Cooperative's Outposts.
Coco is the plan?
The calorie counter's
gonna save humanity?
No. Mallory is.
Coco is going to secure
her place at the bunker.
We have one chance to
use <i>Tempus Infinituum.</i>
And we can't risk trying
it until Mallory is ready.
The only place where
we know you'll survive
is under Michael's nose.
In one of his bunkers.
He can smell a witch a mile away
like some kind of evil truffle pig.
He'll kill her before
she can do anything.
CORDELIA: That's why we're
going to place them both under
an identity spell.
You'll forget that you're witches.
You'll forget everything you
ever knew about yourselves.
The spell will give you new identities,
new personalities.
Your job will be to demean Mallory.
Make her doubt herself in order
to suppress her natural powers,
so that no one can detect her magic.
MYRTLE: We've modeled your
new personality after Madison.
No. No, there must be another way.
Consider it an upgrade.
Will my family still
remember that I'm a witch?
Your family won't be joining you.
We have to eliminate all
variables that might expose you.
But can we just put
them under a spell, too?
Until the Apocalypse comes, yes.
But it would be too risky
to have them in the bunker with you.
MYRTLE: We'll make sure
they're out of the country,
and too far from the Outposts
to make it to safety in time.
My parents are good people
and my brother is kind.
They deserve it so much more than I do.
MALLORY: I don't think
I can be responsible
for the lives of seven billion people.
Yes, you can.
And when the time comes, you will.
How will I knew when that
time is if I'm under a spell?
Your powers will emerge
when they are ready.
After you cast the spell...
will we remember you?
Not until the spell is broken.
And by then, we all
might be piles of ash.
So this is good-bye.
Gather around, witches.
And so it falls to us
to save mankind from itself.
And yes, some of us will die,
but you two will live.
So the Coven will live on.
So the world will live on.
- You ready?
- COCO: No.

Are we thinking bangs,

- You shouldn't even be here.
Excuse me?
It's a complete waste of time.
No offense to your stylist, but...
you can't improve on perfection.
[LAUGHS]
A bowl of Moroccan Harira
is the perfect thing
to fortify the soul.
No, thank you, Myrtle. I'm not hungry.
I want permission to burn a witch.
The only reason to burn a witch
is if said witch causes
grievous harm to another.
What if she helped to
destroy the entire coven?
Who?
Dinah Stevens.
She has a new talk show on TV.
I saw the ad on the side of a bus.
There is no way that bitch
could get a show on television
without selling her soul to the devil.
Double-crossing us was her way
to get a ticket to the Outpost.
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters.
We have to clear the rot.
Madison, you get the
gasoline, I'll get the wood.
No. We cannot afford to do anything
that might alert Michael to our plan.
Delia, she will be a
danger to our girls!
Dinah has never seen them.
Our identity spell is more powerful
than anything that voodoo
queen could penetrate.
I want her safe and sound
until we are ready
to make her pay.
MALLORY: <i>Sometimes I feel like
there's someone buried inside me,</i>
<i>someone trying to claw their way out.</i>

I don't know. I just want to go.

Because you're special, Mallory.

Just don't let me die again, okay?
It really sucked the first time.
When I'm done,
you'll all wish you were still dead.
I always thought the world
would end with fire and ice,
not witches and warlocks.
The seventh seal has been broken.
Wormwood has fallen from the sky
and turned the rivers to blood and fire.
The bottomless pit has been opened
and my swarms of locusts and
scorpions have ravaged humanity.
The world has been remade

it seems Daddy didn't tell
you the most important rule
of bringing on the Apocalypse.
If you want to finish the job,
the thing you have to do first
is get rid of all the witches.
Big mistake.
I could annihilate
all of you in a second
and the world would go
on without missing a beat.
You and all of your
work will be forgotten
in the rubble of the past.
But I want to give you a future.
Fall to your knees and accept
me as your lord and savior,

you raised me from the dead
so that you would have
the power of voodoo
on your side.
But if you know anything about who I am,
you know that the only choice I'd pick
would be the winner.
You're half right, Dinah.

of a powerful voodoo queen. [CHUCKLES]

Papa Legba told me to tell you
you are a pain in his ass.
Apparently your work has been subpar.
