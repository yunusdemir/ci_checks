Damn it, Tarzan!
Dammit, man!

I said I'm not going there,
I do not know if I can.
This negative energy is bad,

Richie, the gate of fire,
can do?
I have one bid
phobia of fire.
Tito, anything,
all that shit
rehearsing that has nothing?
I'm preparing,
not ready yet.
We must do something,
Mike, Mike.

Sure, man.
I hope you can dance,

<i> Start undressing

<i> Why are you looking here?
Look out! </ I></i>
Yeah, that's it!
Put chairs on the stage,
it's time for "Hot Seat"!
You know what that means, no,
girls? It's that time!
It's time for one to one!
You're crazy, boy.
Never kiss the girls,
this is rule number one.
-Beware of herpes.
That, too.
Today you risked
and it paid off. I like that.
-You rocked.

Not mine, is yours.
All are left with
what they get on stage.
What's more the $ 50
I owe you. Beauty?
Be ready
to work so
is not that easy
every time.
Yes, sir.
Mike rocked!
Tito, beautiful work,
Big Dick, they are still
astonished at his dick.
Was 25% dance
and 50% marketing.
What?
Mike-sell very well.
You're forgetting
the other 25% genius.
Genius-boy!
-As we were today, Mike?
Just under $ 2500.
Were $ 400 last week.
This will serve.
Over-the doorman ...
Yes, sir.
It was dangerous what he did today,
using the boy by surprise.
It worked, right?
Do not know if I would,
until he steps on stage.
-He turned.
-What's his story?
I do not know, I met
construction, today.
I met him
to enter.
Then I took him home and he
brought the two beauties there.
He wanted to get
and thought I'd bring it.
Good move.
He may have something.
He is young, beautiful.
-Do not dance at all.
No dance-nothing
but that you can teach.
The youth will be useful to him.
Bring it back
and see what you can.
So what the hell
is happening in Miami?
Miami ... is great.
Necessary to correct a few things
with real estate there,
but then it gets quiet.
Whatever I do?
Keep doing what you do.

Then he said something
over breakfast.
He must be very drunk,

Better to find me

trying to say.
Alright.
If you decide to share ...
You can change your mind
if you have nothing to do.
You know my phone.
And you know how much I love dinner.
Yes, I ...
You can leave.
I started to turn
Ens before. East,
but if I do it all again,
nor would the college.
I mean who does not believe
at school?
Damn the school.
When I have children,
I put it in front of the TV,
and make him watch
"Mad Men" all day.
Teach you about actions,
good investment
and the like.
I guarantee that when
He has 18 years,
the damned will be
surrounded by money.
You know, I do not understand
why not do it.
Known, from the point of view
investment.
So is the country face:
the U.S., the people.
I hope to have children one day.
No problem, you can visit us
when you want,
in one of our
3 houses with swimming pool.
Hey, if you want, I can get
the phone from Dallas for you.
He is beginning
to give life advice,
and I think that can be
very good for you.
I mean, I saw the connection
between you two ...
Sorry, I ...
Right?
You also felt?
What was that?
He just comes out talking
nonsense ...
No, no ...
They talk nonsense
from time to time.
No, do not bother me.
I just want to decide
and drop off.
I understand, neither do
idea of ??what I want for life.
No. How is the stage
it all makes sense.
The way you dance
and how they treat you.
Wait a minute.
Looks like someone was there.
Good to know.
It is.
This feeling should
be crazy.
I understand that.
I understand why you do
it for so long.
-But Adam is different.
-More than that.
He had a scholarship
football.
A year ago,
he basically ruined everything
having an argument with coach
within 1 hour the first day.
-It is his face.
-Is.
I do not know.
I'm just trying to understand ...
-Why strip.
-Why? It's easy.
What do you mean
with "easy"?
-You want the truth?
-Right.
-Are you ready?
-I.
He is 19 years old.
Women,
money and fun.
It should be.
I take care of it.
-Right?
-Okay.
So, come tonight?
-No.
It will come-yes.
-No!
-You said you liked it!
-It does not mean I'm going again!
I will not! I've seen!
I've seen, I've seen enough.
Do not do it.
Do not do it.
I do not ...
He did it alone.
I just brought it home.
Hey, okay?
Thank you.
He is
completely crazy.
Hey Hey, man.
It was bad.
Okay, see you later.
Even more, man.
Hey, thank you.
Thanks for bringing it
back.
I said I care for him,
not spoken?
Take care of yourself.
So ...
How's college?
You are good! Good ...
I'm sorry, I did not understand.
Can you repeat?
Social Studies ...
Sociability ...
-You said "social studies"?
I'm sorry.
What is it? I'm in grade 1
or something?
-No, no ...
-No?
Psychology.
So, how far
to finish Psychology?
I have 6 more weeks ...
Really? 6 weeks?
-Yes.
And then I become
a certified psychologist.
I'm really excited, you know?
-This is important!
-Is.
I'm not paying
for these their visits.
I feel bad
to ask for his money.
See you when I am
primed, so ...
It is not so bad.
-Then you will ...
Yeah, and you,
you ask too many questions,
is not it?
You papeador tonight.
-Papeador.
-Papeador.
The questions are
I think the interest.
Where-are-interested.

Look, I'm going out now

You call me?
Even more.

Interesting.

-Kiyasaki.
-The same.
One minute, please.
Silence, quickly?
Hey, everyone!
Shut up, dammit!
You are in front of me, man.
I'm sorry, man. Excuse me.
Thank you.
I have an announcement to make.
It is for you too, Tarzan,

Let's celebrate.
-Come on!

-I look like a dog?
-What?
-I look like a dog?
-Do not say that.
Let me tell you
something for you.
So ... Then produce
the stripper show?
The most administers?
I am an entrepreneur,
in fact,
I make furniture,
I put some roofs,
let
some details aside,
but, in general,
I tailored furniture.
Tailored furniture?
Then you should be
good with his hands.
-I did not say that.
-I said yes.
-But I have said.
-Good for me.
-It is quite something.
Yes, yes.
What if you could do something
that will let you really happy?
-Happy?
Yeah, forget the money.
Something on the beach, somewhere
where I could do something new.
Really?
-Yes.
Really?
Tables and chairs?
I'd do it all.
But working with mobile ...
There are already falsification
enough in the kitchens.
I have no one
that makes custom furniture.
-I do.
-Okay, is in the business?
I'll be, so that banks
let me make the loan.
I save for 6 years,
and why you think I'm
Strip this business?
I do not know when I have
U.S. $ 13,000, will roll.
U.S. $ 13 000?
Several notes of $ 1 ...
-It has some $ 5.
Without notes, $ 20?
You do not want to know
what I do for a $ 20.
-Is. I do not care.
Let's drink and I'll show you.
No, no,
everything is fine.
So ... Miami?
-Do not be upset.
-I am not upset.
I'm not saying
what to do,
just do not like it.
You .. Just to clarify,
you followed my advice?
Why?
Do not tell you what to do?
-It.
No, not a choice.
I'm just saying that you can
be something that I told you.
-Want some credit?
-We are fighting?
It is our first fight?
Come on.
Let's make up.
I do not like to see it
so.
-I do not want to see her upset.
-Go have fun in Miami.
Just try not to forget
of normal people,
those people
living in the light of day.
-That there are vampires.
-Right.
-So you're not a vampire?
No, I'm not.
This changes everything between us.
-He thought we were vampires?
Yes, I thought it was common.
Want to go out for dinner
one of these days?
Just eat something ...
As a date?
There, except
you call it that.
I do not know.
What? That guy
is better?
Paul and I are
working things out.
-It would be ...
-He also wants to offer an opinion?
I am not a game for strippers
friends of my brother.
Sorry. Who said
something?
He was talking about talking,
be friends, nothing more.
If you want to talk,
let's talk ...
You are giving up
my sister?
No, but if you were?
What would you do about it?
I? Nothing.
She would.
Oh my God.
Come on, do another.
One more.
Come on, man!
I'd love to, but not enough time.
We have a story at night.
I know.
-A history?
Yes, criminals will hold,
and other things ...
Adam, I know what is
going on here.
I'll be a cop
and will do so ...
You ...
Have a great time.
We must stop
fighting well.
Let's stop fighting.
Turn around to go back,
I have the keys, remember?
You do not have them.
Damn, she has the keys.
-I got the keys.
Yeah, she's on!
Good evening.
You live here?
-Yes.
-What's your name?
-Kim.
-You can get away, please?
We have received complaints
drinking and lower noise.
Gentlemen, are all
higher here?
I think we need
verify some identities.
Come with me here,
please.
Girls, all are higher?
-Yes.
-Yes?
It is definitely not.
What year were you born?
September 20th, I'm 19.
19? It was what I thought.
Place your hands on the wall.
Sit down,
let's take a moment.
Spread your legs,
please.
Do you have any sharp object
with whom I can hurt me?
-No.
-Great.
Because I do.
Is giving ecstasy

I asked if he gave ecstasy
my girlfriend.
-Get out.
-Right.
Get out, get out.
Come on!
Come on!
Out of the way.
What are you doing, man?
What are you doing?
Giving drugs to girls
they do not know.
-Shit.
Lucky you, we left there!
I forgot my backpack,
need to go back.
Fuck your backpack,
not return.
All drugs are there!
Fuck the drugs,
will have to overcome.
Dude, I bought the drugs
to earn extra with them.
What are you talking about?
Why he gave you that?
-How many?
I do not know, man.
A 100-tablets.
-That's $ 1000 dollars.
You must pay
each.
Fuck, man.
Fuck it. Guess what?
How well-fuck?
We-equal, man.
Dallas will give us some
all in Miami.
No need to worry
Tablets with a lost.
Damn, that was
crazy.
-You are flirting with her?
No, nothing like that.
My God.
-What are you doing here?
-Hi!
I thought I had
left the city forever.
I decided to stay.
Great.
What's up, dude?
-Mike, nice to meet you.
-Ryan also.
Ryan is my boyfriend.
What?
Are you kidding?
I go to the bathroom.
No, you need
a time to talk.
Already in my time,
anyway.
-Nice to meet you.
-See you there.
Okay ...
Right. Apparently,
nobody likes you.
-Right. Alright.
-It was good to see you.
<i>Our !
Look who showed up! </ I></i>
What happened?
It was nothing. Fucked me.
I'm sorry.
Fucked me.
I'm sorry.
That's all I have to say?
I do not know.
You really want to discuss?
Apparently, not sold.
Yes, sorry.
I forgot to charge ...
money while playing
beer bottles at us.
It's the last thing
I need
my reputation before
my big move.
Sorry, we're fucked
with his reputation?
I know
is our reputation
What are you doing
the difference for you, right?
What the fuck you say, Mike?
You were 20 meters from me.
You heard me.
You better contain
old friend.
Nobody is untouchable
on my team.
Except you, right?
Old friend?
Think you can now go
and fend for himself?
Can not move
me, Dallas.
I walk out that door,
right now,
and achieve more
than 7.5%.
Sorry,
used to be 10%.
But do not leave.
He never left.
And will not.
-Why not.
-I can not?
-Right.
-Then you have to deal ...
with what you have.
What the hell
is happening?
One package that gave me ...
gone.
It has been.
A long time ago.
Sorry about that.
Have to take care of it.
I-solving. Alright.
Need-solving.
Let go of me, dammit.
Being old does not mean
nothing here.
You are worth the money
Plucking

Not getting any younger.
What the fuck are you doing?
I need you to dress

I do not know ... I'm accepting
his advice.
I'll do something new.
Since I am not

Hi.
Hi.
Did you have fun last night?
What?
-Did you have fun last night?
Yes, What?
Adam is here?
I left some messages
strange voice,
looked like it was pretty crazy
and now do not think.
-You can enter.
-Okay. Legal.
Where is he?
It should be up there.
You are with someone,
however, so ...
Do you know ...
Take your time.
Adam?
Adam.
Is he okay?
Stop it. He's fine.
-What the fuck he did?
I do not know.
<i> Open your eyes, man. </ i></i>
What the fuck did you do
with my brother?
He is breathing.
Alright.
Let go of me, Mike!
Let go of me!
-I will kill you, damn it!
-He'll be fine.
-He's not well.
-Calm down.
No. Shut up!
Shut up!
-We make mistakes.
-Shut up. I see you, Mike.
Think you're all right,
all is well, but I see you.
Need to relax.
You are acting like crazy.
No. It's a male stripper
with 30 years of shit.
-Right. Why not leave?
-No problem.
Wake up, Adam.
Wake up, dammit.
Come on. Come on.
Adam, my God.
-Wake up.
-Stop it.
-Let me ...
-No! My brother, my choice.
-No.
-Let me please upload it.
I can not
do this, Adam.
You hear me?
<i> Hey, that's enough! </ i></i>
What the fuck?
-Get out of here!
-Hey! Hey!
Go get fucked.
Sorry, sorry.
Go to shoeing, which are
doing here, Tobias?
I tried to call
on your mobile.
Fuck my phone!
What are you doing, man?
Please. I spoke not to
no break,
but do not work
for me!
-Good job.
I'm sorry, they want the boy.
-We are behind him.
So, break all here?
Why do they want?
He delayed the payment, right?
And apparently, the deadline was today.
There were 100 pills!
$ 1000, I think he paid.
That's what he said?
100?
It was a whole package.
A package!
Son of a ...
-How much?
-US $ 10 000.
What?
-US $ 10 000.
-How it ...
-Listen.
I do not know what it is,
or if it is a boy,
but it does not matter anymore.
You must be joking ...
What I ...
I can speak for him ...
Until he finds out
how to get rid of this ...
I do not know, man.
The guys do not mess with ...
With contracts, you know.
You know, if you want, I can speak
with them and try another day.
And how does that help?
He has nothing.
Look, I hate to see
you doing it.
Just do not fuck
over me, Sal
Okay, but it broke
his neck was an asshole.
-Someone should talk to him.
-You have done enough, no?
I will speak with him, forget it.
I'm looking for Adam,
he does not answer. Okay?
Yes, he's fine.
He does not live here anymore.
Where is he?
-Not sure.
Okay, just tell that I am
looking for him if the check.
That sucks, you know?
You know that, do not you?
This is how we
end it all? Really?
I said all
he had to say ...
He had much to say yesterday.
There's nothing?
Do not want to add?
Do not let me speak yesterday,
Then I will speak now.
Sorry! Sorry to spoil
things, would not it.
I did not want to screw it up,
I promised to take care of him,
did not care,
sorry about that.
The last person I ...
I believe in you, and ...
I know it's a good person.
Adam would ...
What this will.
I just can not be involved
this lifestyle ...
There may be ...
I am not my lifestyle!
Is that what you think ...
This is not ...
I'm not ...
I'm ... Magic
Magic Mike I now
talking to you?
I am not my job!
It's not who ... I'm not ...
It's not what ... do!
It's what I do,
but it is not who I am!
I am not alone ...
So I want to go to Miami,
I do not want to be
an old stripper.
Want to own something,
I ...
I tried that shit
of time ...
So do not believe in anything
I'm saying?
At this point, no?
Nothing I ...
Do not believe in anything?
Mike, I think that is the question is:
do you believe?
I just think Miami will be
a bigger and better version of it.
Good luck to you.
If you believe it,
good luck.
And to Adam, too.
But I'll stay here.
I want to thank
for the money ...
I know how
meant for you.
Especially for all
you wanted to do.
I. ..
pay it all back,
every penny. Learn it.
-Right.
Hence, 20 years,
you must be dead,
but I can look back
and look at everything we did
together, man. Damn!
Look who I was
3 months ago.
And look at today.
Look what I am now.
I can not thank
enough.
Shit, man.
I was nowhere.
I have ...
money, sex can
with whom I want,
I am free,
thank you.
I'm having
my best moments,
and we have our
best moments ...
Miami.
You can smile, then?
You can look at me?
I only have one more thing
to say ...
A toast to
my best friend,
the guy who gave me more in life
than I could have asked ...
and our future.
<i> Cover Girls ... </ i></i>
<i>The first

<i> In a way,

Do not know if it will work.

-Stop it.
You still know how to dance!
-I melt out there, dammit!
That's it!
-Where is Mike?
-He's gone.
Mike!
It should have gone pee,

Mike was gone.
He's gone.
I saw it coming
the back door.
Hey, Mike!
Get back here!
He'll be back, man.
Right ... Come here.
Devastated, man.
-Are you ready, are you?
Yes, I'm ready.
-This is how it is.
-Yeah.
It is now that things
begin to improve.
Come on.
Ken is in, Mike out

and then go to Miami.
<i> Okay, girls ... </ i></i>
<i>They are ready

<i> Make it rain, baby! </ i></i>
<i> are ready to spend? </ i></i>
Here, the last time,
this stage ...
the sole and exclusive ...
King of the Elements!
What are you doing here?
You will not lose
the presentation?
I can ...
I have something to tell you.
Okay, okay.
Come in.
Look, I just came here to say ...
Before you say something,
need to know that when
you have come sooner,
Adam had told me
what you did for him.
And it was a lot of money,
-And not have to do that.
-I did for him.
Nor was why I came,
I just ...
I do not think to Miami.
-Really?
-Is.
I'm tired.
What will you do?
I do not know. I think I need
a new plan.
Whether ... eat something
and talk about it?
Like a date?
Well ..
What does Paul say?
Paul can no longer
say anything about it.
I finished with him.
I'm happy with that.
Not as much as I do.
What a good thing.
In this case, I'd love
a breakfast.
I'll find a nice place.
The thing is, I'll just
to a place. It is my favorite.
They have the best nuts,
know what to ask, I'll ...
and the food is already on the table.
They will also help you, pancakes,
waffles, whatever you want.
I want waffles.
Come ask.
The problem is not open
until 6am.
That's seven hours away.
So ...
What could we do
to 7 hours?
