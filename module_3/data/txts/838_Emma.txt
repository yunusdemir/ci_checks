Make me the happiest man in the world.
You never preferred Miss Smith?
No, my hopes were all entirely for you.
Have you heard the news?
Mr. Elton is to be married.
Miss Fairfax!
Mr. Dixon saved her life!
He was of course,
standing very close to her.
It is a very elegant instrument.
<i>Jane was quite at a loss as to who</i>
<i>might have sent her
this magnificent gift.</i>
Our Mr. Knightley
might just have turned
his mind to matrimony.
No, no, I will not be drawn in.
As I have said, I am done with
predictions of the matrimonial kind.
I am merely telling you, as you have been
so kind to bring the subject up again.
That I believe my nephew Henry is safe
when it comes to inheriting Donwell.
I do not believe that Mr. Knightley
is the mysterious present giver,
it is not in his nature to be secretive.
He is so discreet.
<i>And so is she.</i>
<i>They are very well matched.</i>
I think Jane would make a
very good mistress of Donwell.
Nonsense! Anyhow...
my career in match-making
- such as it was - is over.
Miss Woodhouse. Are you
coming to view the instrument?
We would be so happy to have
your opinion, Miss Woodhouse!
We were on our way.
Mr. Frank Churchill is already here.
Do be careful, ladies.
What do you think? Mrs. Weston,
Miss Woodhouse, er, Miss Smith?
We have had to make room for it, but
it is no inconvenience whatsoever...
so very kind of the Colonel.
What do you say to Mr. Dixon?
Goodness me...are you still
mending mother's glasses?
You have been here so very long.
- Done.
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
Look, Mother...there.
- Now you can see again.
- It is a beatiful...
Mr. Knightley,
oh, Mr. Knightley!
Won't you come and view
Jane's surprise gift!
- A surprise visit?
- Nothing untoward at all.
What do you think, Mr. Knightley?
Well, it is a very
fine instrument indeed.
A very fine gift. We're all agreed.
Yes.
I'm so delighted that Mr.
Knightley likes the piano.
- He has...
- It is a reckless gift...
thoughtless... look at the size of it.
Jane is to become a governess...
is it to stay here
forever in her aunt's home?
The girl is in ill health...
it is a sorry thing indeed.
Morning, Miss Fairfax.
Well, he may not have
given her the piano but
he is very concerned for her welfare...
I wouldn't say Donwell is entirely safe.
Mr. Knightley, I must
thank you for the apples.
It was nothing.
But a whole barrel,
of your special variety,
your cook told ours that there are
none left for your favourite pie...
so very generous.
They are Jane's favourite as
well, isn't that a coincidence?
I have been here in Highbury two weeks,
yet I feel I have always lived here.
Thank goodness your aunt's
health allowed you to visit
and realise how much better
we are than you thought.
Nonsense. I had always the
best of anticipation, but...
please forgive me for this,
I think if there is one criticism I
would make about this wonderful place,
it is... that there's just simply...
not enough opportunity to dance.
Now, tell me that I am wrong?
I do believe you have hit upon
our single defect, Mr. Churchill.
What do you propose?
A ball, Miss Woodhouse,
what say you to a ball?
I say yes.
Yes, indeed!
I am so happy to have
any opportunity to dance.
I am fairly sure that that is one talent
in which I am equal of Jane Fairfax.
Equal? You must be far her superior...
she dances like a cold fish!
Now, let's have a ball here, hmm?
No, no, there's not room.
Well, you were right, as
always, how much better it is
that we should be here in town,
with plenty of space to dance!
Come on, let's test the floor space!
Where will we dine?
I think this room might be too small
and the corridor is very draughty.
Nothing must stop our momentum!
Let's ask our neighbours,
Miss Bates, what she thinks.
Ladies, come up here and
give us a hand, will you?
Miss Bates? You won't get
any sensible advice from her!
Miss Bates!
Miss Bates. Miss Fairfax?
Would you join us, please?
It's a capital idea!
Miss Bates is a woman who
is predisposed to be happy,
and Jane could be one
of our principal dancers.
I think I would rather
the aunt than the niece.
I must have the first dance with you.
We two will lead the ball!
Miss Bates,
I must show you this. What
do you think of this space...
for a ball?
- A ball?
- A ball.
What a marvellous idea, Mr. Churchill,
what a very splendid thing.
Oh, a ball! What a marvellous idea!
I hope nothing will prevent it.
I am so looking forward to it!
Are you sure, Emma, that Mrs. Weston has
discounted the draughts in the corridor?
Absolutely, she has been most
scrupulous in her checking.
Do you think you might come, Father?
There is nothing to stop the
ball being a great occasion.
Frank Churchill and I have made a list,
and he will design the invitations.
I don't know why you have
to be so unenthusiastic.
Only young people can be
expected to enjoy dancing.
But he is not so ancient.
Are you saying you are not coming?
I will accept Mr. Weston's kind
invitation when it arrives...
if it is not too long in the design.
But I will not dance.
I do not enjoy dancing
and I am not good at it.
You must wrap up warm, Emma,
in case some of the young dancers
do something remarkably
reprehensible, like opening a window.
I think you would be more enthusiastic
if Mr. Frank Churchill were not so keen.
However, I have some
information for you.
Miss Jane Fairfax is
looking forward to the ball.
I have never seen her so
animated! About anything!
I assure you, my dear Emma, that Mr. Churchill
will be indifferent to my indifference.
I hardly think I am already marked
down on your dance card, now am I?
Though we may guess who is.
His aunt is extremely ill.
Frank is so low, but...
he has said he is not
leaving without seeing you.
He was very particular.
I shall leave you alone.
I am sure he cannot be about to say
anything that you could not hear also.
I am sure he can.
<i>What can he have to say?</i>
<i>To me alone?</i>
<i>Must I really believe
he is in love with me?</i>
<i>How should one look?</i>
<i>If one were supposed
to be in love in return?</i>
<i>I don't think so...</i>
<i>How does it feel to be in love?</i>
Of all the horrid things...
saying goodbye is the worst.
This will not be your
only visit to Highbury?
Now you have reacquainted
yourself with where we are?
I don't know when I might return.
But it will be the only
thing I think about.
Our poor ball must be abandoned.
Why did we wait? Why
didn't we seize the moment!
You said we should not wait.
Why are you always right?
I am sorry to be right this time.
I would much rather be merry than right.
So you must be off this morning?
Er, yes.
You will come back...
I think we have impressed you,
though you were not expecting
to like us, admit it!
What a pity you have no time to visit
your other friends before you leave.
Miss Bates' steadiness and clarity of
thought might have calmed your anxiety.
I have been there...
I, er, I thought it right...
my duty to tell them I must go.
In short...perhaps, Miss
Woodhouse, as you know everything...
... you could hardly be without suspicion.
I thought I would be
able to stay here forever.
My, erm,
well, my...
my regard for...
this place is, erm...
is very warm.
I must go.
<i>The sensation of listlessness,</i>
<i>weariness,</i>
<i>stupidity, this inability
to sit down and do anything.</i>
<i>This feeling that everything around
the house is dull and insipid...</i>
<i>when it never was before...</i>
<i>It can only mean one thing.</i>
<i>I must be in love!</i>
Mrs. Elton,
your castle awaits.
Harriet, please...
... for my sake, oh,
no, I do not mean that...
for your sake...
this terrible misery over the Eltons.
That there could not be any
greater reproof for my mistake,
it was all my doing, do not
think I have forgotten it...
do not think I make light of it!
But you are the best
friend that I ever had!
Nobody is equal to you...
Miss Woodhouse, I have
been so ungrateful.
I will try my hardest.
For my own sake...
to be tranquil.
As always, I would like to
begin today with some of the most
spiritually uplifting words
from the Old Testament.
Words that I have found most comforting.
"Let deceitful lips be made dumb..."
I declare this reminds
me of Maple Grove.
My sister will love this house!
She delights to travel.
She has the latest carriage, large
and comfortable enough for four
and high enough that
one can see for miles
when one is travelling into the
countryside for summer parties!
Parties in the countryside!
We are a very quiet set of people
- we like to stay in the home.
I understand your
situation, Miss Woodhouse...
why does he not try Bath?
- Where the waters, I find, are so agreeable.
- My father...
It would cheer many an
elderly gentleman up!
And for you, of course,
who have lived such a secluded
life, out of the best society...
well, just a line from me would
open up a host of new acquaintances.
Oh, we have heard that you
are very musical, Mrs. Elton.
I dote on it! Dote!
As I said to Mr. E, don't
give me two carriages,
don't give me enormous houses but
I could not live without music. No.
Life would be a blank to me.
We should establish a musical club.
Have regular meetings at yours or mine?
As leaders of society
we should show the way.
Who else have we visited?
Oh, the Westons, of course.
I was rather astonished to find her so
ladylike, as I believe she was your governess?
And who do you think we met
while we were at Randalls?
Knightley! Knightley himself. He's
so particular a friend of Mr. E.
So often mentioned, I
was impatient to meet him.
And... I must do my caro
sposo the justice of saying,
he need not be ashamed of his friend!
Knightley is quite the gentleman!
Biscuits, darling!
Absolutely.
Knightley indeed...
never seen him in her life
and she calls him "Knightley"!
Insufferable woman!
Horrible, upstart, vulgar being
with her "Mr. E" and her "caro sposo"
and her carriages and air of pert
pretention and under-bred finery.
Actually to discover that
Mr. Knightley is a gentleman
and that the woman who brought
me up should be ladylike!
I've never met her equal!
"Knightley" indeed!
I have known him all my life
and even I don't call him that!
She's everywhere I go!
The guest of honour, droning on about
her sister's brand new barouche...
you'd think we were all poor little pygmy
people, who never travelled from our fire!
Though in my case of
course, she's right.
She had the cheek to say
that maybe it was a good thing
the ball had to be cancelled,
because she didn't
know whether the Westons
could organise such an event without
her experience in social occasions!
And you don't need to pretend to be
disappointed the ball was cancelled.
I'm not going to pretend,
but it really was very
bad luck for you, Emma.
You don't get many opportunities
to dance. Or to get out at all.
I've brought you a book
from the Donwell library.
Box Hill!
I hear you can see for miles!
There is no reason you
shouldn't see for yourself.
We are in the same
county, it's not the moon.
Come on, stay under the
umbrella, you'll get soaked
if you get outside.
There's only one umbrella
and there's two of us.
One of us will get wet.
Good morning, Miss Fairfax.
Oh! Good morning, Mr. Knightley. I didn't
realise you were visiting Hartfield.
Yes, just for a few days.
You're out early?
I like a walk before
breakfast. It does me good.
Not in the rain, surely?
I am going to the post
office, it is not far.
I should turn back, if I
were you. You'll get drenched.
Boys! Henry, James, come along.
Unlike you, Miss Fairfax,
my wife and father-in-law
are far from indifferent to the rain,
so I must get the boys home.
Will I see you tonight?
Emma's party for the new Mrs. Elton.
We must be on our best behaviour!
Of course.
- Is that a letter from Ireland?
- Yes. But, er...
I would love to read it.
No, I will read it to you later.
Well, the children are in bed.
- Now, John, please.
- What?
- Please, be agreeable.
- Me? When am I not?
Mr. Weston is not here yet,
he is usually all
benevolence and friendship.
Why on earth did you invite her
if you can't stand the woman?
Because it is my duty, of course,
we are the foremost family
in the neighbourhood.
Now, please, be pleasant.
I hope you did not get wet on the
way to the post office this morning?
And the letters?
Not the, er, curse they often are?
Yours are of business.
Mine of...friendship.
Oh, they're the worst of the two.
Business may bring money,
friendship hardly ever does.
- You are not serious.
- He is not serious, Miss Fairfax.
May we take it that
you did receive a letter
from a loved one this
morning, despite the weather?
Perhaps from Ireland?
I'm sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of you being
out in the rain at the post office this morning.
Young ladies are delicate plants,
you must take good care of your health.
I am much obliged by your concern, sir.
Going to the post office in the rain.
You sad girl!
We shall have to do
something about this!
Well, the man who collects our letters
every morning shall enquire
after yours and bring them to you.
You are very kind.
But I will not give up my walk.
No, my dear, I'm afraid it's settled.
Excuse me!
I will not consent to your
servant being troubled!
I, I, I think that it can be a verygood
idea to take a morning walk if possible,
and you are not so far
from the post office,
and then, of course, there
is the issue of privacy.
Well, I obviously have to accustom
myself to the ways of the countryside.
Naturally, those of us from the city with modern
manners would never dream of any indiscretion.
- Of course not, my dear.
- Thank you.
But remember the people ofHighbury
are quite... unsophisticated.
They do not have your
experience of life.
Quite so,
and in Bath we would certainly
have announced dinner by now.
Dinner is served.
Now, Jane, it's time we found
you a position as a governess.
The very best positions are snapped
up as soon as they become known.
Colonel and Mrs. Campbell
are in town by mid summer.
I must spend time with them.
Please do not trouble yourself.
Oh, trouble! What nonsense.
No, I shall write to Mrs. Partridge
and tell her to be on the lookout.
Thank you, but I would
rather you didn't.
We'll find you a marvellous position.
I am sure that...
when the time comes...
I am not afraid of being
unemployed for long.
Here comes my old beau!
I like him excessively.
He is full of old-fashioned politeness.
He's always praising my dresses.
See how he leads the way to talk to me.
What do you think of this one?
Rather handsome, I think,
not sure if it's over-trimmed?
I have the greatest dislike of
the idea of being over-trimmed,
quite a horror of finery.
Mr. Weston, at last!
We were expecting you a little earlier.
- Good evening, Mr. Weston.
- Miss Woodhouse.
I was late home from
London and found this.
Read it, my dear, it's for you.
You have opened it!
Then you know full well what it says.
Mrs. Churchill has taken a
house in Richmond for her health!
Frank may now come and go as he pleases.
His aunt cannot keep him from us.
He can always be home.
I confess I have been
longing to see Mr. Churchill.
We are very much missing
young and elegant company.
You'll be dancing again
before long, Miss Woodhouse.
We shall have our ball after all.
Miss Woodhouse.
You have arrived just in time
to give your advice, will it do?
Will it do? It's
beautiful! It's magical!
How wonderful you look tonight, Emma.
Doesn't she, my dear?
I thought I had come early to help.
He has asked everyone to come
early to give their advice.
The dancing will have
started before we know it.
Frank will be here
somewhere, I'll fetch him.
<i>Is this how it should be?</i>
<i>Is he still in love with me?</i>
Is Mrs. Elton here?
I have a great curiosity to meet her!
<i>He is not still in love with me.</i>
<i>But I do not seem to mind.</i>
Oh, my heavens, it's fairyland,
it's nothing less than fairyland.
Aren't we lucky, Jane, to have
such friends? Look, so many friends.
Look, Mr. Churchill, come let
me introduce you to Mrs. Cole...
Miss Woodhouse, isn't it lovely?
It's like a dream.
It is magical, isn't it?
<i>This is how they do things in Bath.</i>
<i>Mrs. Elton will be disappointed.</i>
- Yes.
- What's the matter?
She will expect it.
Dear, Emma, what shall we do?
We fear that, erm, Mrs. Elton
expects to lead the dance.
Frank must dance with her.
Er, no, no.
Miss Woodhouse is my partner for
the first two dances, lead or not.
Well, why do you not lead her out?
Remember, I am not
dancing in my condition.
How do you like our Mrs. Elton?
I don't like her at all.
Ladies and gentlemen, the town square.
The room is most excellently
contrived, is it not?
Miss Woodhouse looks
so brilliant tonight.
- So beautiful.
- Yes.
Yes.She and Mr. Churchill
are made for each other.
What are you doing over here with
the old men and the card players?
I told you, I don't dance.
Miss Woodhouse, the second dance.
The Ship's Cook.
I see you are watching MissFairfax,
have you picked up any
clues as to her mystery?
Miss Bates told me she had
received a letter from Ireland
that made her very happy.
Perhaps from her friend, Mr. Dixon!
No, I was merely thinking
how awful her hair looks.
So unbecoming,
I can't think what would
possess anyone to look that way.
Shall I go over and say something?
Goodness me, no, the music
is starting, we must dance.
Do you care for another?
No, Mr. E, I am sitting this one out.
I cannot dance every dance with
the same degree of accomplishment.
I do not put myself at the
front for all to admire,
unlike some I could mention.
Quite so.
Do you not dance, Mr. Elton?
Most certainly, Mrs. Weston,
if you will dance with me.
I am not dancing tonight, sir.
Mrs. Goddard, then?
Though I am an old married man,
it would give me great pleasure.
You must excuse me, Mr. Elton, I
have danced my last reel, I'm afraid.
I see a young lady who I should
very much like to see dancing.
Miss Smith?
Ah, erm, Mrs. Weston,
you must excuse me,
but I am an old married man and
my dancing days are quite over.
No.
Hey!
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
How happy Miss Smith looks,
she is such a pretty girl.
How well she dances.
Oh, such food, it is the
best I've ever tasted.
No coffee, thank you, for
me. I never take coffee.
A little tea, please. Oh,
here it is already, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For what?
Your secret is out.
You dance better than anyone.
I was completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.
There is a littleness about
him which you saw and I did not.
He always was a small man,
made smaller by his wife.
I was convinced he was
in love with Harriet,
how could I have been so stupid!
I will do you the justice of saying
that you would have chosen better
for him than he did for himself.
Miss Smith has some
first rate qualities,
infinitely preferable to a
sensible man than Mrs. Elton.
I was surprised by our conversation.
Come on, young ladies, supper's
over, time to start dancing again!
I am ready, sir!
- Gilley's Market.
- Who will you dance with?
Why, you,
if you will ask me?
Will you dance, dear Emma?
I danced so much I had sore feet.
Wonderful.
I know, it was so charming.
It was probably the best dance.
Harriet?
HARRIET!
Harriet! What on earth happened?
<i>Miss Woodhouse, it was awful.</i>
<i>I was walking back to school
with my friend Miss Bickerton,</i>
<i>when we were set upon by
some villainous evil gypsies.</i>
<i>Dozens of them. They wanted my money.</i>
<i>Then, just in time, who should arrive...</i>
What's going on!
<i>... but Mr. Churchill. On his horse.</i>
Such a thing has never happened before!
We have always been able to walk
safely inthe lanes around Highbury.
How very fortuitous it was that
you just happened along when
poor Harriet was so desperately
in need of your help.
- It was nothing.
- Oh, no indeed.
You are too modest, Mr. Churchill.
I owe you my life!
I am sure of it!
Miss Smith.
Everything will be fine.
<i>I would not be surprised</i>
<i>if Harriet were about to fall in
love for the third time this year.</i>
- You look much brighter.
- Thank you.
<i>You have captured Miss
Smith to perfection.</i>
What a fool I was.
Harriet,
when you are happily married, in years
to come, we will laugh about this.
Oh, no,
Miss Woodhouse.
I will never marry.
This is a new philosophy.
Please, tell me this is
not because of Mr. Elton.
Him!
Oh, no.
If it were to do with anyone,
that someone would be a man
so superior to Mr. Elton,
on a much higher plane entirely.
Harriet,
I know I promised and I fully
intend never to interfere,
but do I gather that your
resolution never to marry
is because you feel the
person that you might prefer,
and remember my match-making
days are strictly over,
is too superior to you
to ever think of you?
Oh, believe me,
I have not the presumption.
I am not so mad.
But it pleases me to
admire him from a distance.
To think of his infinite superiority
to all the rest of the world.
With gratitude, wonder and respect.
Oh, Harriet,
I am not surprised that his service
to you was enough to melt your heart.
Oh, yes! The very recollection of it!
And all that I felt at the time,
when I saw him coming to my rescue,
how very noble he looked!
How everything changed
from perfect misery
to perfect happiness.
It is very natural that
you should be so grateful.
But, Harriet, beware.
I think you should check your feelings.
Do not get carried away.
Be observant of him, let his
behaviour to you be your guide.
More wonderful things have happened,
there have been many happy and
unequal marriages, but... no more.
I am telling you this for we
will never talk about this again.
No names shall pass between us and there
will be no possibility of a mistake this time.
But you should know, I do
approve of the man in question,
though we will never
mention his name again.
Mrs. Elton, the ball seems...
Now, Jane, time is rushing by.
We must find you a good position.
Come, come.
All the best places will be snapped up.
As I have told you before,
I must wait until the summer.
There are plenty of places which
deal in the governess trade.
Dear! You make it sound like slavery.
Yes, your music will help you.
I am sorry, Emma,
I really don't know what
you've done for Mrs. Elton
to behave towards you in this way.
I cannot say that Mrs. Elton's
friendship is much of a loss to me.
I am astonished, however, at how
JaneFairfax encourages her confidence.
Maybe she lacks the sensible
comfort of an equal friendship,
little wonder she has to make do
with the Mrs. Eltons of the world.
We know how highly you
think of Jane Fairfax.
Anyone may know high highly
I think of Miss Fairfax.
And yet, you may not
be aware how highly?
The extent of your admiration
may take you by surprise one day.
You've finally heard
the gossip, have you?
Hmm, Mr. Cole told me of
his suspicions weeks ago.
And what did you say to Mr. Cole?
I told him I was not about to turn
Miss Fairfax into Mrs. Knightley.
She would not have me if I asked her.
I like Jane and admire her.
She's a charming young
woman but she has a fault.
She is reserved, she's more
reserved than she used to be
and I like an open temperament.
Until Cole mentioned it, the
thought hadn't entered my head.
Go and get it.
Well, then,
what do you have to say to that?
I say, I never saw a man so
occupied with not being in love
that I should not be surprised if
we were yet to hear wedding bells.
Isabella has had five children.
This is true.
Do you think it strange that I,
her only sister, did not go to
London for any of their births?
Do you think it strange?
I was there, after all.
That's what I mean.
I do love Highbury
and I have never felt like leaving.
And I could never leave Father, but...
the fact that I have no desire to travel
might look strange to other people.
To Frank Churchill?
Oh, no, he doesn't think badly of me.
Mrs. Elton, then?
You've never bothered about
what people thought before.
Even Jane Fairfax has friends
and the desire to be with
them in Ireland and Weymouth.
If you were to ask me,
I would say that you
were in need of a project.
Box Hill!
It will be a very small
and intimate party,
and we will only invite
the people we like.
Box Hill?!
Oh, yes! Well, I will arrange everything.
I am so experienced in organising the carriages,
leave the whole expedition in my hands!
I know Mr. Weston is the
friendliest man in the world.
I just wish he wasn't so friendly.
Now I will have to suffer the Eltons,
and I was so looking forward
to our trip to Box Hill!
I don't know, dear Emma, it seems to me always
best never to contemplate eating outside.
Mrs. Elton's carriage horse is injured,
which means we all cannot go to Box Hill.
That woman ruins everything.
We are only to postpone.
We will go, Emma.
In the meantime, why don't
you all come to Donwell?
The strawberries are ripe, and those
who wish to sit indoors may do so.
Oh, what a delightful idea!
I should like that best of all.
I shall wear a large bonnet and
put a pink ribbon on my basket!
But how on earth will
we all get to Donwell?
We could all go on donkeys!
A necessity, I think,
for dusty country life!
Donwell Lane is never dusty, but
you may come on a donkey if you wish.
- Look, here comes Dr. Perry.
- Good afternoon, Dr. Perry.
Good afternoon, everybody.
What happened to Dr. Perry's
plan of setting up a carriage?
Couldn't he help us out for Box Hill?
I didn't know he had such a plan?
Ah, but you wrote about
it to me, two months ago.
You did! In your letters!
Mrs. Perry was very keen on it,
had been trying to
persuade him for ages.
Are you all right?
It was a mistake, a mistake not to take a glass
of water before stepping out into this heat.
You should be more
careful, Miss Fairfax.
You know, Mr. Churchill, I think Dr.
Perry was thinking about a carriage
but decided he couldn't afford it.
Mrs. Perry told my
mother about it. Jane,
do you remember her telling us?
Er, Miss Woodhouse, have your nephews
taken away your box of alphabet letters?
I think, well I think
Miss Fairfax needs a rest.
We all need to relax with a simple game.
How good it is to be reminded
of the child in us all.
Some of us don't need to look that far.
How exciting. I do love a
good game of alphabet squares.
You are so very good at the letters.
Let's see what we have here.
I am sure we will...
I will take care of the invitations
to your little strawberry party.
What invitations? Oh, I hope I can come?
As you can see, quite a few of
the possible guests are here.
Yes, but as to the rest, leave it to me.
No, thank you, but I will manage myself.
Married women are the best
organisers, leave it to me.
No, there is but one
married woman in the world
who I could ever allow to invite
what guests she please to Donwell.
Mrs. Weston, I suppose.
No, Mrs. Knightley.
And until she is in being,
I will manage matters myself.
Oh, yes...
What have you got, Jane? Have
you any others we can add to?
Miss Fairfax?
Do let me try.
I am so hopeless at games.
Mr. Knightley, will you help me?
Blunder!
Well done, Harriet.
No, no! For shame!
I shall give it to her, shall I?
No, you mustn't.
No.
I did... I did not know that
proper words were allowed.
Oh, yes, Jane, let's go.
I will call the carriages.
Well I hope the invitations will arrive
in time for the strawberry picking.
I am so glad you told Mrs. Elton
you would not need her help,
she really is insufferable!
And as for Mrs. Knightley,
we all wonder who she may ever be!
Emma.
May I ask,
what the great amusement, or
rather the poignant sting of the
last word, "Dixon", that was
given to you and Miss Fairfax?
It seemed to give you entertainment
and was very distressing to Jane.
I could tell you,
but you would not approve
and would call me a gossip.
Dear Emma,
do you think that you
perfectly understand
the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman
and the lady with whom you shared this joke?
Between Frank Churchill
and Miss Fairfax?
Of course! Perfectly!
It's just that lately I have imagined
that I saw a certain attachment,
certain secret looks.
Secret looks?
Goodness me. Erm...no.
The joke was, I admit,
a little... indiscreet,
but it was harmless
and I promise you, nothing to do with
any kind of attachment between them.
It is more that Miss
Fairfax has an admirer
and Frank and I are trying
to work out who it is.
There.
A childish pursuit we young people like
to indulge in, I'm sure you would say.
Mr. Knightley,
I do not know why, but you
do not like Frank Churchill.
I am sorry for that,
but it does not mean that
you should start to imagine
all sorts of things about him and
his behaviour that are mere fancy.
I know you are keen to protect
me as an older brother would,
and I know you think I should behave
as I should, and I promise you,
I would never do anything to truly
injure Miss Fairfax ever again.
But if Frank Churchill were in any way
attached to Miss Fairfax,
and I assure you he is not,
then he wouldn't, he would never...
He would never share
a little joke with you?
You surprise me! I have
never known you so unjust!
Or your judgement so inaccurate.
Frank Churchill is an amiable young man
and I can vouch for his indifference
to Miss Fairfax, believe me.
Are you... Are you staying for
supper? It is almost time and...
Oh, er, no, thank you.
But I...
I just find the fire a little
too warm for me tonight.
I was thinking how at home you look.
You might be mistress of this house!
I blame you entirely.
I cannot resist you, from
the very first day I met you!
We shouldn't be talking such nonsense
in front of seven silent people.
I'm going to leave this country
just as soon as I can book a ticket.
Frank will be free.
Though, of course, we are all very
sad that Mrs. Churchill has died.
He will be able to marry. You know the
Westons have always intended Emma...
I have felt exhausted for so long.
The greatest kindness you could
do me would be to let me go.
- Badly done, Emma!
- I dare say she didn't understand.
I assure you she did! She has
spoken of nothing else since.
Mr. Knightley is going to London.
This is a sudden idea, isn't it?
It is to be a substantial trip.
Goodbye.
