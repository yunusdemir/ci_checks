How was your day?
Ah, it was a bit cold.
How did Frankie do?
Oh, Frankie was tremendous.
That's a good boy.
Are you hungry? Are you sure?
Good.
I won't give you too much.
There you are.
There.
Bless us, O Lord,
for these, thy gifts...
which of thy bounty
we are about to receive...
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Last night, a masked gunman broke
into a house in a remote coastal area...
and shot to death,
in front of his family...
a man believed to be
a Republican sympathizer.
This is the latest in the new
Outbreak of killings...
following the breakdown
of peace talks...
between Unionists and Nationalists.
Here's your target, gentlemen.
Frankie Maguire.
He has been responsible for the deaths
of 11 Regular Army lads...
seven R.U.C. Officers...
and uncounted numbers
of Loyalist paras.
This bastard has never seen
the inside of a cell.
I'd like to change that.
This is it, lads.
Mind how you go.
- What about you, lad?
- Stand by.
Jesus!
Come on. Duck in here.
All units, move!
Move it!
Seanie!
I'm all right!
Jesus Christ,
half the fucking army's out there!
Jesus, Frankie!
Keep your heads down!
I'm fucked, Frankie.
Frankie, come on! Let's get out
of here! We've got to move it now!
Go on.
We have to go now,
Frankie! Come on!
Go!
Desmond...
where's Frankie Maguire?
Up your fuckin' arse.
Yesterday, in what the army said was
a routine security operation...
soldiers in a house-to-house
pursuit of an IRA gunman...
found themselves in a firefight
that resulted in unexpected casualties.
While the IRA denounced the attack as
an unlawful and murderous operation...
the army put full responsibility
on the IRA and said it had no choice...
but to respond
to the latest outbursts of violence.
Although both sides said that this Only
made the search for peace more urgent...
authorities say
the casualties sustained...
cast further doubts on the future
on any peace initiatives.
Frankie?
It's Martin.
For fuck's sake, Frankie.
You had me shakin' there.
How are you doing?
Grand.
You hungry, Son?
Cheers.
Present from the lads.
They send their best.
- Good to see you.
- You're looking well.
Fuck you, you cunt.
There was a big turnout
for Dessie's funeral.
Which was good.
The cabinet was talking peace.
The whole time the SAS
were waitin' to wipe us out.
It was a setup all right.
- One of our own?
- We still don't know who.
I was gonna get you a paper
but there didn't seem much point.
Northern Ireland office
spoutin' the same old shite.
I guess they say
the word "peace," you know...
but at the end of the day,
all they want is surrender.
Those fuckin' things.
If we could take them out...
they'd have to listen.
I've been working on that.
Stinger missiles.
Maybe then they'll talk peace.
It's going to need you, Frankie.
So you're a judge, are you?
State court.
I don't know too many judges...
socially speaking.
Do you want to know what's
the single biggest problem...
trying to raise
money in this country?
People don't understand
what's going on over there.
Well, we're all the same,
Mr. Fitzsimmons:
If you're not confused,
you don't know what's going on.
That's it, isn't it?
It's fantastic.
Home sweet home.
When we need the money,
we'll need it quickly.
Here's an address
of a construction site...
in case anybody wants
to know where you work.
I told them you were a friend
of the family, starting out.
- They're connected, aren't they?
- No, not in the least.
I've known Tom O'Meara 20 years.
He served under my father.
What, in the army?
- The police force.
- A cop?
Safest place in the city.
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Okay, okay, honey.
Right there.
- Mr. O'Meara?
- Tom.
- Come on in.
- That's Annie.
- How was your trip?
- It was good.
A long one, isn't it?
Come on in.
This is Morgie.
Morgan. Morgan!
Hey, honey.
Say hi to Rory.
Sheila's in here.
Come say hello.
Rory's here.
Welcome. I'm the mother.
Nice to meet you.
- Thanks.
- Where's Bridget?
What do you think?
She's on the phone.
Careful. The kids were supposed
to get this crap out of the hallway.
Well, it's not much,
but it's dry and it's warm.
It's great.
The bed's over here.
There's a bit of a bath-shower here.
You gotta jiggle this thing.
Sometimes it runs on.
How are you fixed for work?
Did Fitz find something for you?
- I start in a couple of days.
- Good. TV's over here.
- What are you doing?
- A building site.
Construction, huh?
Good. Good.
Well, if there's anything
you need, just...
No, it's great. It's very decent
of you to put me up like this.
Don't thank us, thank Fitz.
- Guys, dinner!
- We'll be right there, honey!
Besides, it's good to have somebody
around here that pees standing up.
For fuck's sake.
For food and clothes,
and all that grows...
for family too,
dear God, thank...
Dear God, thank you."
I hope Rory likes the basement...
because I don't.
Rory likes the basement a lot.
Go ahead.
Pass the vegetables.
May I serve you?
Say when.
The meat looks delicious,
what is it?
It's corned beef and cabbage.
I thought that's all
you ate over there.
No, I've never had it.
You've got this over there,
don't you?
Aye, we do have that.
In fact, I was baptized in it.
- Have some cabbage.
- You were baptized in beer?
It's a joke, honey.
Have some meat and some vegetables,
then you can have some bread.
Mom put a lot of effort into this meal.
The least you could do is eat it.
Why do you always pick on me
about that stuff?
- Will you pass it down, please.
- What?
- Pass the mustard.
- Come on. Girls.
What part of Ireland are you from?
From Cookstown.
Where's that?
Is that near Belfast?
It's in the middle of the North.
It's on the shore of the Lough Neagh.
Do you have a girlfriend
in Ireland?
- Come on, guys.
- Morgan, come on.
- That's kind of a personal question.
- Yeah, do you?
Leave the guy alone.
Give him a break. He just got here.
You know,
Bridget has a boyfriend.
- I'm sure she does.
- Will you guys knock it off, please?
Well, Rory...
welcome to America.
Thanks.
Sector David, 2746. 13:30, meal.
Diaz, you're
with me again today. 14:30.
Everybody else,
same post and meal as yesterday.
This is getting ridiculous.
Everybody's laughing at me.
Why?
I'm supposed to drive the car.
You're supposed to sit back
and ride next to me like a gentleman.
Your stripes entitle you to that.
Absolutely.
Now the guy who rides
with a sergeant is a chauffeur.
And that's me.
So, when are you going to let me do
my job? When am I going to drive?
I don't know. Tomorrow.
You've been saying
that for three years.
Excuse me. You wouldn't have
the right time, would you?
- Give it up.
- You're too tall.
- That's my sister, you bastard!
- Oh, Frankie!
It's Rory now, you punk.
Rory, Frankie, whatever.
What's that?
- It's a high five. You're in the U.S.
- Ah, for fuck's sake.
Look at the state of you,
you beggar's blaze.
- It's called style.
- And who says?
- Calvin Klein.
- A circus clown, more like.
Look at that one.
Sorry. It wasn't my fault.
He did it!
I didn't!
Look at the two of us:
A couple of Fenian bastards like us.
Amusing, isn't it?
Come on.
Ah, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Jesus Christ, mind the car,
will you? I just had it waxed.
- That's yours?
- Aye. She’s a beauty, isn't she?
- Ah, bollocks!
- Honest to god!
Bought and nearly paid for.
Fuck, I left the door open.
Now, Frankie...
are we going to go
through with this?
35 post. 7, Central.
I got a foot pursuit
northbound.
Towards 207. Male, black.
- 5' 11".
- Hey, Sarge. The car is blocked.
Central, 35 Sergeant.
205 and post.
Heading westbound,
towards the park!
35 Sergeant
with a portables north on Tenth.
Atop! Atop!
207, Central.
Towards the park. Male, black.
Hey! Move!
Damn it!
Northbound, Central.
Crossing Broadway. I need a 1095.
Wait! Wait! Wait!
35 Sergeant.
They're north, through the park.
That's a copy, 35 Sergeant.
1032 in progress, requesting backup.
You'll be sorry! Got that?
- Don't lose him.
- I'm on him!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it! Come here!
Put your hands up!
Let me see your hands!
This is my collar!
It's my collar!
I got it.
Take it easy. Don't you know
not to run away from police?
- Yes, sir.
- What, are you crazy?
You'll get yourself shot that way.
What do you got here?
He racked this out
of the Tenth Avenue Bodega.
I witnessed him
put it in his pocket.
You witnessed this?
He witnessed this.
How old're you, Son?
- Fifteen, sir.
- Twenty-two.
Stand him up.
That's old enough to know not to run
away from the police, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- What's your story?
I was too embarrassed...
to bring the condoms
to the cash register.
Turn him around.
Stand still.
Turn around.
Give me your hand.
Thanks a lot. I swear
I will never do this again.
Take a hike.
Sarge, why don't you cuff the rookie?
Here it is.
The Irish Republican Navy.
What do you think?
The pitch is off.
Do we have to pull it?
Give us a half a knot.
A knot, maybe.
For fuck's sake.
What is it?
She’s pissing antifreeze.
I knew it.
Pull it.
We got the prop work,
the pitch and all that...
the caulking, the pipes
on that keel cooler...
the transducer,
the pintle bearing, the bilge pump...
repacking the gland,
timing the engine out,
the sea chest and
a dozen 55-gallon drums of fuel.
Why don't we just Fed-Ex
the damn gear home and be done with it?
I mean, the two of us crossing the
Atlantic with a hold full of missiles...
just so as they can shoot our arses off
as soon as we get over there!
That's crazy.
Aye, it's fucking mad.
Three years from now,
I'm gonna have my pension in the bag...
and you know what I'm gonna do?
- What you gonna do?
- I'm gonna raise pot-bellied pigs.
Pot-bellied pigs.
Last night I was watching television
and saw this guy.
The son-of-a-bitch is making a fortune
in New Jersey, you know?
- Pigs?
- Yeah. So I'm gonna get some.
Hi, girls!
What about the bakery?
Last week it was going to be a bakery.
You know how early you gotta get up
in the morning to bake bread?
We have a 1052 at 42 West 135th Street.
Female caller states
husband is getting violent.
Police!
Police. Open the door!
Mommy call the police?
Why don't you put that gun down?
Come on.
Get the gun!
Watch it!
Take it easy.
- It's these fucking guns.
- What have you got here, sarge?
It's these fucking guns.
John's downstairs.
I'm here to collect
for Irish Relief.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Irish Relief?
- Billy Burke.
- Rory Devaney.
Martin sent me.
He's a good man, Martin.
So how do you like America,
Rory Devaney?
Fine.
Land of the opportunist,
if you ask me.
That it is.
Fourteen years old,
I was sweeping the back of a saloon...
today I got three of my own,
among other things.
You've done well for yourself.
Done well
with you lads too. Drink?
Sit down.
- When can we take possession?
- Possession?
These ain't egg rolls
you just ordered.
It was Stingers jacked
the Russians out of Afghanistan.
- It's gonna take some time.
- How much time?
Six, eight weeks.
Yeah, fine.
Can I put you up?
No, I'm sorted out, thanks.
- Where you staying?
- Across the river.
Across the river?
Where across the river?
- Brooklyn?
- Something like that.
- How do I get in touch with you?
- Ask for Sean.
This is a Manhattan number.
Rory, listen, about the money...
I think that you and I ought to come...
When we have our gear, you'll have
your money. It's no problem.
Cheers.
Are you Belfast boys
all born such hard-ons...
or is that something
you just grow into?
You asleep, honey?
Oh, you faker.
I'm not tired.
Let me give you the mummy tuck.
Where's ducky?
It's a sleepy ducky.
It's kind of funny to see...
my sister getting
all worked up about him.
I guess she thinks he's kind
of cute. I mean, he is cute.
You know it's not like
she'd have a chance.
- I mean, you know, he's from Ireland.
- Get off the phone.
- Wait. Hold on a second.
- How long have you been on the phone?
Not that long.
We're talking about homework.
- Who are you talking to?
- Fran.
Three minutes.
Five. Five more minutes.
Please?
You have to press "D-l-R,"
"return."
- There.
- What did you just press?
- "D-l-R." Then "enter."
- That's directory.
Then if you want to get
the next file, press "S."
- And so what does "C-L-S" do?
- "C-L-A."
No, don't do it.
Don't... Tom?
We're out of milk.
Close it? I don't want
to close it. Don't pull off.
I'm gonna go get some milk.
Come on, take a little walk?
I'll buy you a beer.
Come on. It's just
up the street, a few blocks.
It's very peaceful here, isn't it?
It's quiet.
Do you know all the people
in these houses?
Yeah, most of them.
Do you like 'em?
Well, we all get along pretty well.
What's it like over there,
with the violence I mean?
Oh, it's violent.
People are fed up.
Doesn't seem to be much point
to it anymore.
It all depends
where you're looking from.
Me, I just try to keep
my wee arse out of it.
These houses,
they're fantastic, aren't they?
They're pretty old. Some of 'em are
from around the turn of the century.
Our new ones are older than that.
O'Meara, how you doing?
Good.
Tony, say hello to Rory Devaney.
Oh, another friggin' Mick, huh?
I'm an immigration agent.
Stick out your green card
on the table now.
Come on. Come on.
He's trying to bust your balls.
He runs the pet shop down the street.
He's the prince of the poodles.
Those are fightin' words.
You know what this is,
don't you, Irish?
That's an Italian love-muscle.
Aye, that's why it's in your hand.
Oh, a wise guy, huh?
Well, let's find out
what you can do with one of these.
You and the good sergeant,
me and Joey.
Italians versus Irish.
Throw the milk
in the cooler, Joey.
All right.
Lovely.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I saw that.
You're a wonderful man.
- Unbelievable, isn't he?
- You are a wonderful human being.
I don't know
if I can shoot now.
You up, goombah.
Did you hear about the Irish guy
who tried to blow up a car.
Burned his lips on the tailpipe.
Scratch.
Would that be mine?
Ah, you're up, Irish.
What is this?
The luck of the Irish.
You really pushed him.
Shit.
No way!
- All right.
- Let me check your green card again.
- There you go.
- Thanks for the lift.
You got some money?
Clean hanky?
- I'll see you for dinner.
- All right.
- Frankie, leave it, eh?
- Take that, you Fenian bastard!
Frankie, you bastard!
Come on and fight,
you wee skinner.
I'll get you!
No surrender!
Burke called.
Burke called.
He wants to talk to you.
Everything's set up for next week.
He's going to need the money.
One, two, three.
Snip, snip, snip, snip,
snip, snip, snip.
- I changed the scissors.
- Delivery for Mr. Fitzsimmons.
Oh, I can take that for you.
Do you need me to sign for it?
No. That's fine.
Isn't it lovely
the way they glide like that?
With not a care in the world.
You're from Belfast?
You don't know who I am?
I'm Michael's sister.
Michael Doherty's sister?
- Megan.
- Ah, Megan.
How's your mother?
You know, not so good
since they killed Michael.
Well, will I be off then?
I best be gettin' on with it.
- All right. Watch yourself, Frankie.
- I will.
You as well, love.
Best to you.
What I wouldn't have given
for that when I was 13.
Mom said dinner's ready.
That's a lovely dress
you have on there.
It's for Morgan's
confirmation tomorrow.
Are you married?
Then will you marry me?
I'll have to ask your da.
Morgan, what are you doing in there?
I need to take a shower!
Wake up, lazybones.
Will you please get out!
What are you doing?
Get out!
But it's my confirmation.
I deserve to look good!
Oh, my God. You're not gonna look
any better anyway.
So you might as well just give up.
Mom! Morgan just gave me
the finger!
Would you please tell her
not to do that?
Tell her to get out of the bathroom.
She only listens to you.
- What?
- Oh, no, Dad!
Oh, my God. There's something
seriously wrong with this family.
In the name of the Father...
of the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
You have already
been baptized into Christ.
And now you will receive
the power of His Spirit...
and the sign of the cross
on your forehead.
You must be witnesses
before all the world...
to His death...
His suffering, His resurrection.
Your life must, at all times...
reflect the goodness of Christ.
Now that you've come of age...
I ask that you renew
your baptismal vows.
Do you renounce Satan?
I do.
Do you renounce all his earthly works?
I do.
Do you renounce his empty promises?
I do.
Do you believe
in the Holy Catholic Church...
the communion of saints...
the forgiveness of sins...
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting?
I do.
Amen.
- Hi, Aunt Birdie! How you doing?
- What?
He said hello.
Rory, this is my friend Brooke.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You looked lovely up there.
- Thanks.
Stop it!
I'll be back in a sec.
- You acted like such a dork!
- Did not!
You made me do it.
You're like, um...
Are you from Ireland?
Coming through.
Hot plate here. It's Mom Lasagna!
Is the corkscrew there?
You must be the faithful sidekick.
I'm the thing that lives,
like, beneath the stairs.
Don't I look Irish to ya?
Hey, Eddie! How're you doing?
When did you get here?
I'm gonna have a pop.
Do you want a pop?
Come here. Come here.
Rory, come here.
I love these guys!
Telephone.
In the kitchen.
Martin 's dead.
They got him.
We don 't know how much they know.
You could be next.
You can 't go through with this.
This way, please,
ladies and gentlemen.
The Cloisters is a series
of monasteries...
that was transported here
stone by stone...
from Romanesque and Gothic monasteries
in the South of France.
So, where's the judge?
He's scared to death.
He thinks if they're on to Martin
they'll be on to him.
He says to tell you
he wants no part of it.
And the money?
He said to hold onto it.
Not to go through with the deal
without some word from Belfast.
So is that it, then?
Is it finished?
By no means is it finished.
I'll have to slip back
into Belfast.
Frankie, you can't show
your face in Belfast now!
I don't plan on showing my face.
Listen...
tell me who to see and what to say.
I'll go.
Given the particular situation...
we're gonna have to postpone.
Well, that's no problem.
Don't worry about it.
You can make the payment now,
and I'll stockpile the stuff for you.
I can't do that.
The message is to sit tight till things
get worked out back home.
- Hey, Mike, how are you?
- All right, hey.
I'll tell you, Rory,
I'm sorry about Martin...
but these are not soda cans
you asked me to get for you.
These are no deposit,
no return items...
and I am out-of-pocket
for some very serious dollars.
You are putting me
in a very awkward position here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Burke,
that's the way it has to be for now.
Well, if that's the way
it has to be.
It's the way it has to be.
I have to fly to Dublin...
and go up to Belfast
to visit my mummy.
Then I tell them the three points
that you might come in at.
That's it. That's lovely.
- Right.
- Now you have it. Grand.
Grand.
But it isn't just
a message, Frankie.
I mean, like...
Do you ever, like...
Do you ever feel guilty
about it?
Aye, of course there's guilt.
Sleepless nights about...
some things...
No one's innocent in this situation.
Everyone has their ghosts.
Are you all right?
You sure?
Hoy, Paddy!
Beautiful.
All you need now is a house,
couple of wee volunteers and a dog.
Look at this bullshit.
Wait till I get around.
Take the radio.
Central, 35 Sergeant.
We got a 1032 GLA in progress.
Man.
Shit.
- Gun, Eddie! Gun!
- Fuck.
- Police! Freeze!
- Shit!
You all right, Eddie?
Yeah! Get the fucker!
Hey, hey! Atop!
Stop, damn it!
Toss it!
Toss it, man!
Don't make me shoot you!
Asshole!
Jesus.
He was getting away.
He's dead, man,
and half his face is gone.
What happened?
He was getting away.
Then he turned around
with the gun in the hand.
You shot him in the back, Eddie.
Here's his gun.
He tossed it around the corner.
He shot at us, Tommy!
He shot at us!
Thanks, Ted.
Okay, Tom.
I'll be in touch.
You did good, Tom.
- Grand jury is kind of backed up?
- Yeah. Two or three weeks.
- Have you talked to Sheila yet?
- I'm gonna wait till I get home.
Want a lift?
No. I'm okay.
You Diaz?
That mutt! You know he took
two shots at me. He broke...
This your P.B.A. Rep?
Yes, he is.
Didn't he tell you that you don't
have to make a statement for 48 hours?
Yes, he did.
Take his advice.
How did it go in there?
Fine.
What's that mean, "fine"?
You shot him in the back, Eddie.
He was running away.
He didn't have a gun.
He shot at us.
We're in the police business, Eddie.
Not the revenge business.
Did you cover for me?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just stopped, had a few drinks,
and I didn't want to drive.
He's here now.
So, maybe half hour or something.
You all right there, Tom?
They were shooting today
at me and Eddie.
Eddie killed the guy.
- Killed the bad guy?
- Not that bad.
I saw his sheet.
A couple of punk things, but...
Poor Eddie.
Fuck!
Pull over, man.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
You okay then?
Just give me a minute here.
God, I got "The Exorcist" here.
New York's finest.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Can I ask you something?
You ever shot anyone?
No, I've never shot anyone.
I've fired my gun four times...
on the street.
Four times in 23 years.
You pick up a gun, sooner or
later someone gets a bullet.
Big boys' rules.
What do you know
about big boys' rules?
Common knowledge, I suppose.
You ever shot anybody?
When I was eight,
some men came into my house.
Killed my da.
Killed my da in front of us.
Jesus.
Let's go, please.
All right.
I'm sorry about your dad.
Did they get the fuckers?
They are the fuckers.
Don't look for happy endings, Tom.
It's not an American story.
It's an Irish one.
What is it?
That Lopez guy didn't have a gun
in his hand when he was shot.
- He tossed it.
- What?
It was nuts out there.
Eddie didn't see him toss it.
I had the gun in my hand
when Eddie shot him.
It was a bad call.
Well, you covered for him.
I lied about how it went down.
I thought it through, Sheil.
I'm gonna take my pension.
Retire.
It's 23 years,
and you never took a bribe.
You never abused your power.
You never treated anyone unfairly.
- I treated the dead guy unfair.
- He shot at you.
He was stealing radios.
He got shot in the back.
You don't deserve to get killed
for stealing a radio.
Tom, it's terrible that he died.
But you're not the only cop
on the force who's made a mistake.
Besides, you didn't make
the mistake, Eddie did.
I lied.
Don't you understand?
There are some things
I said I would never do.
Once, Tom. You did it once.
What about next time?
I can't do the job this way.
I'm done being a cop.
But you love being a cop.
I love you.
I love the kids.
I love what we got.
I don't love being a cop...
anymore.
I never told you this.
That I was the only Irish girl
in Brooklyn...
who didn't want to marry a cop.
I don't want to go back to work.
The kids won't be home
for two hours.
Well, hell, I'm retired.
What?
Sheil, dial!
Officer needs help.
We're at 87 Cornelia Avenue.
Now! Now! They're armed!
87 Cornelia Avenue. Now!
Sheila, get out!
Get off of him, man!
You, get up! Get up! Now!
Do it!
- Easy, man. Easy.
- Shut up!
Get him up there against the wall!
Get him up against that fucking wall!
Take it easy, man.
What do you need?
You shut your mouth, man!
They get here...
things are gonna get
a lot more complicated.
Now, nobody got hurt.
Walk away now.
Walk away now.
Damn it!
Let's get out of here, man!
Go, now!
Let him go!
You stay right where you are, man.
Don't fucking move, man!
Don't you fucking move!
Let them go. Let them go.
I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Jesus, Tom.
- They're leaving.
Are you okay?
Honey, it's okay.
- It's okay. Nobody got hurt.
- Oh, God.
Nobody got hurt.
It's all right.
Are you all right?
Jesus, man, thanks.
About 230, 240...
6' 4" or so.
The other one was medium.
All white guys.
Wearing masks?
Just what do you think you're doing?
Get him out of here.
You're a stupid man, Mr. Burke.
You're only seeing me standing
between you and the money.
But you're forgettin' about the
thousand other men standing behind me.
That's a mistake.
Are you with me there, love?
You might want to talk
to Sean about this.
Maybe I'll give him a call.
You could give him a call,
if he was home.
But he's not home.
You want to see him?
I know he wants to see you.
My pearls are still there.
And the cash wallet.
The TV, the VCR, the computer.
Nothing's missing.
Call me when you get
to your sister's, okay?
You get a rain check.
I owe you one.
I'll have the girls call you tonight.
Go get the money,
and we can do the deal.
There's a warehouse at Twelfth
and Hudson. I'll be waiting, okay?
And please don't fuck around,
or I'll kill your friend.
You stupid man!
Jesus.
I'll explain when you get here.
I need you, Eddie.
Who are you?
Did you bring this into my house?
Where'd you go when you left here?
I went to make sure
it wouldn't happen again.
It was all lies, wasn't it?
Everything you told us.
Except for how I feel
about you and your family.
That wasn't a lie.
I'm sorry.
I never meant for this to happen.
It just...
Look, I'm in a bind.
I don't have time to explain.
I'll get my gear, and I'll clear out.
What's the money for?
I was thinking guns.
I was thinking IRA.
I need that money, Tom.
Why?
So other eight-year-olds
can watch their fathers...
gunned down in front of them?
If this money leaves here...
more people will die.
Can you tell me that won't happen?
Let me ask you, what if...
tonight, everything you had
was burned down around you?
What if you and yours...
walked out on the street,
and you were spat on?
Told you you were nothing?
You're no good?
What if it was one of yours
cut down by a plastic bullet?
One of yours you had to bury?
Would you just sit back and say:
"Oh, well.
Remember Annie?
She was such a sweet one.
God bless her."
Just try to make some kind
of sense of it. You fucking try.
You look around at all the people,
and you realize...
you're dealing with a government
that's failed everyone.
All sides.
We're normal people
in an abnormal situation.
Fighting a disgusting, ugly war
that you can't understand...
because you haven't lived it.
I'm sorry it's gone badly between us.
You're a good man.
But understand...
I have to go.
I'm also a cop...
and I can't let you go.
I'm going, Tom.
Come on, Eddie!
Cuff him!
You drive.
Jesus. Look at this.
It's this trash thing.
I am a police officer. I'm gonna have
to ask you to move this vehicle.
- Officer, I can't do it.
- You're gonna have to move the truck.
- We got a guy in the back.
- Listen. You move it!
Move!
Don't!
What kind of animal is this?
A bear.
What kind of noise does a bear make?
And what kind of animal is this?
- A owl.
- That's right.
And what kind of noise
does an owl make?
That's right.
And when do owls come out?
In the nighttime?
Something terrible's happened.
Some people here to see you.
FBI.
This is Sergeant Thomas O'Meara.
Sergeant, I'm Evan Stanley,
this is Art Fisher.
New York Field Office, FBI.
We'd like to ask you a few questions
about your association...
with Frankie Maguire.
Who's Frankie Maguire?
Francis Austin Maguire...
a.k.a., Frankie The Angel.
Born July 27, 1964.
Belfast, Northern Ireland.
From December 1985,
he was a unit commander.
The Falls Road Active Service Unit,
Belfast Brigade...
Provisional Irish Republican Army.
Wanted for the crime of murder.
Thirteen British soldiers...
eleven police officers.
One thing I'm not clear about.
Exactly what is your relationship
to this terrorist...
Sergeant O'Meara?
Who are you?
Harry Sloan, Sergeant.
British Intelligence.
You are Irish.
So is Cardinal O'Connor.
I have been tracking these murderous
bastards for nearly two years.
He's the last of them.
A month ago we were informed
that he had surfaced in New York.
I have been given the authority,
by both my government and yours...
to use any means necessary
to bring closure to this issue.
You want to talk to me again...
you read me my rights.
I want you to cooperate
with these people.
Don't piss your career away over this.
They're not gonna bring him in.
They're gonna kill him.
The money...
the missiles.
Where's Sean?
I have to see him.
What do you think?
You're gonna fuck with me?
You bog-Irish hick!
Fuck with me?
I think not.
You're on your own here, Laddie.
You know it...
I know it...
and I guarantee you,
Sean knows it.
Get him.
Give us the money.
You're a stupid man, Mr. Burke.
Sweet dreams.
My mind's been racing 100 miles
an hour since I heard.
I've got a plan.
You know my sister, Geraldine,
and her husband, Joe McDonnaugh?
They're livin' in San Francisco.
We'll get you on the train tonight,
and they'll sort you out.
- There's no sorting me out.
- There is.
I killed a cop.
I know. That's why
you've got to go there.
I leave tonight.
Going where?
Back home.
Frankie, are you mad?
We've got enough fucking murders
in our lives, we don't need another one.
I'm gonna take that boat, and I'm
gonna ram it straight up their arse.
I need you to tell 'em I'm comin'.
Look. I'm not saying
you have to give it up.
All I'm saying
is to lie low for a while...
until the whole thing quietens down.
Frankie, if you want to fight,
you have to stay alive.
You're no use to anyone
if you're dead.
Seanie's dead.
Oh, Christ.
I leave tonight.
- Yes?
- Is the boss in?
- I'm afraid he's occupied right now.
- It's police business.
How are you?
Not so good.
Tom, I had no idea.
I called you
as soon as I got the news.
I was at the hospital with Eddie.
I am so sorry about Eddie.
Tom, I sponsor dozens
of these kids.
I should have checked
his background more carefully.
Maybe I'm stupid,
but I just can't put it together.
What's it for?
The money.
What's all that fuckin' money for?
I don't know what your talking about.
I'm racking my brain.
The only thing I can think of...
is guns.
Like the one my wife
had jammed in her face.
You know there were guys
with ski masks and guns in my house.
Did you know that?
Why don't you go home?
Get some rest.
I'm sorry, Peter.
I will go home.
I am tired.
As soon as I lock him up.
But do me one more favor.
Tell me...
where is he?
I don't know.
Where is he?
I'll put your head
right through this fucking wall.
Atop! Hey!
I just want to talk to you!
Come here!
Open the door!
God damn!
I just want to talk to you!
Where is he?
He's not here.
Don't you touch him!
Leave him alone!
Keep away from me, Tom!
What's your name?
There's a way, Megan.
I'm Tom O'Meara.
Rory's been staying with us.
Did he tell you?
I understand why he's doing
what he's doing.
If I had to endure
what he's endured...
if I was eight years old
and saw my father gunned down...
in front of my family...
I'd be carrying a gun too.
But I wouldn't be wearing a badge.
I'm not going to lie to you, Megan.
I'm here to bring him in.
He killed a cop.
The FBI's after him.
The guys he was doing business
with here are after him.
There's an SAS agent...
who has tracked down and killed
every other member of his unit.
He doesn't have to die.
But if you want to see him again...
you gotta help me find him.
I promise you...
I'll do everything I can
to bring him in alive.
Mr. O'Meara!
Hold it!
Let me see your hands.
I got to bring you in, Son.
I'm not going back, Tom.
The killing's got to stop, Frankie.
Then you'll have to kill to stop it.
Gets a bit complicated, doesn't it?
Nobody has to get killed.
- Go home to your family, Tom.
- Don't move!
I'm not going back!
I told you. I warned you.
Did I tell you my da was a fisherman?
He loved the rocking of the sea.
He said there was no more peaceful way
of going to sleep.
You're a good man, Tom.
Hang on, Rory.
I'll get you to shore.
Hang on, kid.
I told you.
It's not an American story.
It's an Irish one.
We never had a choice...
you and I.
