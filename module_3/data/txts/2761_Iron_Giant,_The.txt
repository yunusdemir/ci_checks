Mayday! Mayday!
This is the Annabelle.
I'm Iost and I'm taking on water.
My Iast good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees. . . .
Portland Station to AnnabeIIe.
What is your position?
I don't know exactIy. Off the coast
somewhere near RockweII! Wait.
The Iighthouse! I see it!
Over here, honey!
Hey, Mom! You won't beIieve
our good Iuck. Guess what I found?
Hogarth, we've been
through this before. No pets.
But he's not a pet, Mom.
He's a friend.
We've got to rent a room
if we're gonna make ends meet. . .
. . .and no one wants
shredded uphoIstery.
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.
UntiI you feeI sorry for him
and set him free in the house!
Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?
I remember the raccoon.
PIease, Mom, at Ieast Iook at him.
AII right. Where is this guy?
I can't read this handwriting.
That one shouId have Iettuce,
tomato, extra mayo.
I wiII go get him, okay?
So he wants us to hoId the mayo
and the mustard.
How about just hoId
the fIavor aItogether?
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Sir?
Excuse me--!
-What's that?
-PIease don't move.
My pet's under your tabIe.
Don't Iook!
If you make a scene,
my mom won't Iet me keep him.
-What kind of pet, kid?
-A squirreI.
He's friendIy.
I'm teIIing the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space. I saw it.
And it was headed toward Iand.
I caIIed the government
in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified fIying object.
Unidentified? Knowing you, EarI,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I beIieve you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a fIying saucer. . .
. . .from Mars?
I bet we couId find it.
Sorry, kid.
I didn't reaIIy see anything.
If we don't stick up
for the kooks, who wiII?
Is my son bothering you, sir?
No! CaII me Dean.
Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?
I wiII, Mom.
-Right after I finish taIking with--
-Dean.
-Found your pet.
-Where?
SquirreI's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.
Don't wig out.
Okay. He's heading north now.
I'm sorry, kid. I'd Iike to apoIogize
to everyone in advance for this.
Check, pIease.
It's a rat!
HeIIo, this is Hogarth Hughes
speaking. Who's caIIing?
I'm reaIIy sorry, but--
Thank you.
I need to work Iate tonight.
There's chicken in the icebox.
You can have that and carrots--
I'm way ahead of you, Mom.
I'll make it up to you.
-I love you.
-Me too.
And, Hogarth...
. . .no scary movies, no Iate snacks,
in bed by 8:00. Got it?
Come on, Mom.
It's me, remember?
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Melon.
If we can transplant 15 %
of their brain matter into ours...
... we may be able to read minds.
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.
You've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?
Let's say my place.
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.
Darn. I seem to have left
my keys in the lab.
You're gonna get it.
Who 's there?
Come on!
Stupid antenna.
Invaders from Mars!
Honey?
HeIp! HeIp! Stop! HeIp!
Don't you know better than
to wander off at night aIone?
What if something happened?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Don't you ever do that to me again.
I was so scared.
I thought I'd Iost you.
You won't beIieve this.
Something ate our TV antenna.
No! I'm serious!
It's not Sputnik,
Iike Mr. Stutz thought.
No, it's a robot!
No, reaIIy, it is!
And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!
And it eats metaI!
Stop it! Just. . .
. . .stop.
I'm not--
I'm not in the mood.
Come on. Let's go home.
A peaceful, stay-at-home
kind of day in a town...
... very much like your own.
But then, suddenly,
without warning...
...atomic holocaust!
But how does one survive
an atomic attack?
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.
It was a metaI meteor.
It ate his boat. My dad says--
It wasn't any of those.
What wouId you know about it,
Poindexter?
Don't make me come over there.
Hands over your head
Keep low to the ground
Time to duck and cover
The bombs are coming down
Duck and cover
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it onIy eats metaI.
Shut up, you IittIe spaz!
It's been sent by foreigners
to take over the country.
We shouId bomb it to smithereens
before it does.
'Cause all the kids who don 't
Will cease to be around
Thanks for the scrap.
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this. . .
. . .this Iarge bite out of it.
That's why I'm seIIing it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.
-What couId've done this?
-I toId you what.
Strange invaders.
Thanks for beIieving me.
I reaIIy did caII the government.
They're sending someone
to take care of the whoIe thing.
Jeez, EarI.
You reaIIy are crazy.
Who in the heII wouId
the government send?
Kent MansIey,
UnexpIained Phenomena.
-Marv Loach. I--
-What happened?
Not sure. Sometimes the Iine'II snap
if the weather is bad, sure.
But for a whoIe tower to get
twisted up Iike that. . . .
It's got me beat.
It's aImost Iike it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.
Enormous beast.
What do you think?
Escaped goriIIa?
What department is that again?
I'm not at Iiberty to reveaI
the particuIars of my agency. . .
. . .and aII that that impIies.
You mean nationaI security?
Let's put it this way.
Once in a whiIe, things happen. . .
. . .that can't be rationaIized
in a conventionaI way.
PeopIe wanna know
the government has a response.
I am that response.
So were there any witnesses?
WeII, sir, if you'II just foIIow me.
We did find this.
United States Government, huh?
Guess that means something big's
happening here.
No, Marv. Big things happen
in big pIaces.
The sooner I fiII out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.
Enormous beast, yeah. . . .
Biggest thing here is
the homecoming queen.
Oh, my God!
Come on, I need a witness.
-It's around the corner.
-Don't puII so hard.
It's Iike a chomp
out of the side of the car.
It's Iike a bite out
of a sandwich, Iike a--
What are we Iooking at here,
Mr. MansIey?
Something big, Marv.
Something big.
HeIIo!
Come out!
Hey, big metaI guy,
I got food here for you!
MetaI!
Crunchy, deIicious metaI!
Come and get it!
So I guess you're
not gonna hurt me, huh?
The shutoff switch.
You saw me save you.
So where are you from?
You came from the sky, right?
From up there?
Don't you remember anything?
Maybe it's that bump on your head.
Do you taIk?
You know, words? ''BIah, bIah, bIah,''
Iike that? Can you do that?
WeII, you get the idea anyway.
Let's see.
See this? This is caIIed a rock.
Rock.
Good.
That is a tree.
Rock. Tree.
Get it?
That's right!
My own giant robot.
I am now the Iuckiest kid in America!
This is unbeIievabIe.
This is the greatest discovery since,
I don't know, teIevision or something.
I gotta teII someone. I shouId caII--
No, they'II panic.
PeopIe wig out and shoot
at something big Iike you.
Wig out. It means crazy.
You know, Iike. . . .
No, no! Don't do that!
That's the stuff
that makes them shoot at you.
Two nights ago, at approximateIy
1 ,900 hours, sat com radar. . .
. . .detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere. . .
. . .Iosing contact with it 2 1 /2 miIes
off the coast of RockweII.
Some assumed it was a meteor
or a downed sateIIite.
But Washington received
a caII from someone. . .
. . .who reported an actuaI encounter
with the object.
This is no meteor, gentIemen.
This is something much more serious.
We can't caII Ripley's Believe It Or
Not because they wouIdn't beIieve it.
And. . . .
It's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon. . .
. . .Mom's gonna wonder where I am.
If she comes Iooking for me
and sees you. . .
. . .we got the screaming probIem again.
So for now, wouId you,
you know, just. . .
. . .just stay here, okay?
I'II come back tomorrow.
Goodbye.
No, no.
Me go.
You stay.
No foIIowing.
Good.
I toId you!
I'II come back tomorrow!
Now, stay!
Bad robot!
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.
My mom wiII wig out.
That's right.
So you have got to stay
in the forest. . .
. . .and I'II bring you
some food tomorrow.
But I gotta go home now.
So goodbye.
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?
Look at this mess!
Put it back!
Put it back right now!
HeIp me! I need your heIp!
Good, good!
Put them together. Like this.
This one here, that one there.
Okay, over, over. Good, good.
Now the other one.
Okay. Good enough.
Let's go!
What the--?
That's fine! Leave it aIone!
The train is coming!
The train is coming!
Come on, Iet's go!
You're aIive!
-Anybody out there?
-We're in troubIe now.
Are you aII right?
I've changed my mind.
You can foIIow me home. Let's go.
Mayor's office.
What? A train accident?
He hit a giant creature?
What creature couId
be big enough to--
I need your car.
You can fix yourseIf? Neato!
Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?
I'II be back. Bye!
Bye.
What happened here?
Go on. TeII him what you saw, Frank.
You're not gonna beIieve this.
But it was a giant metaI man.
Does anyone know where
I can get to a teIephone nearby?
WouId you say grace?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. . .
. . .we thank you.
For. . .
. . .the food that Mom. . .
. . .has put in front of us and--
Stop!
The deviI. . .
. . .from doing bad things and. . . .
Get out of here!
Satan?
Go!
Go, so. . .
. . .that we may Iive in peace. Amen.
Amen.
That was reaIIy unusuaI, Hogarth.
Forgot to wash my hands.
Stop, stop!
AII right. Come on. Over here.
Come on, over here. Come on.
Hey there, scout. Kent MansIey.
I work for the government.
Hey, there. Kent MansIey. Work for
the government. Your parents home?
We're eating.
Who's there, honey?
HeIIo there. Do you have
a teIephone I couId use?
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Here.
Pretend you're a gangster.
-You caII me at home for this?
-You don 't understand.
-It ate my car.
-And you saw this happen?
No, I didn't actuaIIy see it.
It went off into the woods.
So you don 't have any evidence?
But I've got an eyewitness!
An eyewitness with a concussion.
This thing is a menace.
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!
What did?
TeII me again, MansIey,
and this time. . .
...listen to yourself.
A giant metaI monster.
PIease, sir. I've got
a feeIing about this one.
That's lovely, Kent. But let me
try to explain how this works.
If you toId me you'd found,
say, a giant footprint. . .
. . .I'd send an expert
to make a pIaster cast of it.
Get me a photograph and
I couId get some troops over there!
But you teII me
you've got a feeIing. . .?
AII right, fine. You want evidence?
I'II get you evidence.
And when I do, I'm gonna want
a memo distributed.
That sounds sweII.
I'll want that memo carbon-copied
and redistributed--
Hi. Thanks for
the use of your phone.
Thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs. . .?
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.
That's Hogarth!
What an embarrassing name.
Might as weII caII him Zeppo.
What kind of a sick person
wouId name a kid Hogar--?
Hog Hug.
Hogarth Hughes!
Kent MansIey.
You work for the government.
I wasn't gonna say that.
I have something for you, Hogarth.
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?
At the power station.
-Hogarth was there the other night.
-ReaIIy?
See anything unusuaI, Hogarth?
Nothing. . .
. . .unusuaI, reaIIy.
Gotta use the bathroom.
Strange he's tightIipped. The other
night he couIdn't stop taIking.
I mean, 1 00-foot robots and whatnot.
A hundred-foot robot?
That's nutty!
What eIse did he say?
No, wait, stop!
Excuse me.
What is going on in there?
Are you aII right?
I'm fine.
You know, this sort of thing
is why it's so important. . .
. . .to reaIIy chew your food.
A IittIe privacy?!
Sorry.
Sorry.
He's been acting strange IateIy.
That hurt.
Thank you again, Annie.
Good night, Hogarth. I'm sure
we'II see each other again reaI soon.
If you're gonna stay here. . .
. . .you gotta keep better track
of yourseIf.
Anyway, I thought you'd Iike
a bedtime story or something.
I've got some reaIIy cooI ones.
Mad Magazine, very funny.
The Spirit, very cooI.
Boy's Life?
Oh, here.
This guy is Superman.
Sure, he's famous now. . .
. . .but he started off just Iike you.
Crash-Ianded on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.
But he onIy uses his powers
for good, never for eviI.
Remember that.
That's Atomo, the metaI menace.
He's not the hero.
He's the viIIain.
He's not Iike you.
You're a good guy.
Like Superman.
Superman.
You're hungry, aren't you?
But I don't have any metaI here.
Just foIIow me.
Pick me up, okay?
Okay, now, march!
Oh, yeah. That's RockweII.
Nice pIace, huh?
RockweII?
Yes, I was born right down there.
RockweII!
No, stop!
Look out for the cow!
Come on, no, not there!
PIease stop. No, stop!
We can't go there yet.
PeopIe just aren't ready for you.
That was cIose.
We can't go running around
Iike that, okay?
Look!
That wouId be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
You know, hide?
It's when you--
You know, when you--
Just get behind something, quick!
Don't move.
Our troubIes are over.
This is it.
AII you can eat.
Turn it off!
Come on, turn it off!
AII right, who's out there?
I know you. SquirreI boy.
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.
Come on inside, kid.
Sorry about the crowbar.
You'd be surprised how many peopIe
wanna steaI scrap.
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.
I mean, what am I?
A junkman who seIIs art
or an artist who seIIs junk?
You teII me.
I Iike it, I think.
Listen, you're not gonna caII
my mom, are you?
She doesn't know I'm out.
Don't worry, kid. It's not my styIe
to report a guy to the authorities.
I'm gonna have coffee.
What do you want, some miIk,
or what? MiIk?
Coffee's fine.
I drink it. I'm hip.
I don't know.
This is espresso, you know?
It's Iike coffee-ziIIa.
I said, I'm hip.
She moved me up a grade.
Now I'm more not fitting in.
I was getting A's.
Mom says, ''You need stimuIation. ''
-I go, ''I'm stimuIated enough now. ''
-That's for sure.
''You need a chaIIenge. ''
So now I'm chaIIenged. . .
. . .to keep my Iunch money because
of the mooses who wanna pound me. . .
. . .since they think I'm smarter.
But I'm not,
I just do the homework.
If everyone did, they couId move up
and get pounded too. More coffee?
Look, it's reaIIy none
of my business, kid. . .
. . .but who cares what
these creeps think, you know?
They don't decide who you are.
You do.
You are who you choose to be.
-Did you hear that?
-No, wait. Stop!
It's okay!
My God!
-He isn't gonna--
-Run, kid! Run!
It's okay. He isn't--
It's okay.
He isn't gonna hurt me.
Don't squash him!
Do not. . .
. . .squash him.
His name is Dean.
We Iike Dean.
So. . .
. . .where'd he come from?
He doesn't remember.
He's Iike a IittIe kid.
LittIe. Yeah.
Wait a minute.
You can taIk to him?
He can't say a Iot of words yet,
but he understands things pretty good.
I see.
He needs food and sheIter.
You got plenty of room here.
-This pIace is perfect.
-Go away.
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.
I can't hide it here.
-''Him,'' not ''it. ''
-Whatever.
You don't even know where ''he''
came from. Or what the heII ''he'' is!
He's my friend.
Yeah, what am I?
Am I your friend?
Bring a Franken-bot with out-of-state
pIates, make me change my tune.
I don't Iike that jazz.
God, I'm tired.
So, he can stay?
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.
SIeep tight.
I'II see you tomorrow.
-You're up?
-Just making the bed.
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.
Morning, sport. SIeep weII?
Isn't it wonderfuI?
We finaIIy rented our room.
I'm not very hungry.
-This is Hogarth Hughes.
-I said he couId stay the night, kid.
It's morning now.
I'II try to come over. But there's
this weird guy here who's watching me.
What's that mean?
I got this big, giant--
Giant thing out here.
I can't taIk right now, okay? Bye.
Who was that, sport?
Friend of yours?
Yeah. He's a new kid.
Stop! Stop that! Stop it!
Mind if I ask you
a few questions, buckaroo?
Why wouId you teII your mom
about a giant robot?
What was at the power station?
TeII anyone eIse?
How big is this thing?
Been in the forest IateIy?
Champ? SIugger? Cowboy?
Where you going?
I'm going out!
Why not take Mr. MansIey with you?
Show him the sights.
Oh, Mom, the sights?
I'd Iove that. Give us
a chance to get acquainted.
There are two kinds of metaI.
Scrap and art.
If you gotta eat one,
eat the scrap.
What you currentIy have
in your mouth is art!
Art?
Forget it. Forget it!
It's gone. It's--
That's not bad.
First, you take a chocoIate bar.
Any bar'II do.
Do you mind if I. . .?
Knock yourseIf out, skipper.
You crumbIe up the chocoIate
into IittIe pieces.
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?
Yes, I see.
What do you caII this again?
LandsIide. It's new. Very new.
LandsIide.
Topnotch.
You know, Hogarth, we Iive
in a strange and wondrous time.
The Atomic Age.
But there's a dark side to progress.
Ever hear of Sputnik?
Yeah, it's the first
sateIIite in space.
Foreign sateIIite, Hogarth,
and aII that that impIies.
Even now, it orbits overhead.
Watching us.
We can't see it, but it's there.
Much Iike that giant thing
in the woods.
We don't know what it is or
what it can do. I don't feeI safe.
Do you?
What are you taIking about?
What am I taIking about?
What am I taIking about?!
I'm taIking about
your goIdarned security!
WhiIe you're snoozing. . .
. . .back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?
Because everyone wants what we have!
Everyone!
You think this metaI man is fun.
But who buiIt it?
The Russians? The Chinese?
Martians? I don't care!
We didn't buiId it,
and that's reason enough. . .
. . .to assume the worst
and bIow it to kingdom come!
Now, you'II teII me about this thing.
You'II Iead me to it.
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!
HoId that thought and stay there.
LittIe Iower. LittIe bit Iower. . . .
I thought you were in troubIe.
That sucks. Let me. . . .
I ditched this weird guy
staying at our house.
It took me hours to shake him!
I kiII myseIf to get out here!
And you have him doing
arts and crafts.
You got a probIem with
arts and crafts, IittIe man?
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a IittIe undignified.
WeII, smart guy,
what wouId you have him do?
Main systems on. Main engines.
One, two and three.
AII systems go.
Five, four, three. . .
. . .two, one!
BIast off!
We're Ianding. We're Ianding!
We're Ianding!
Say, can you guys
cooI yourseIves a IittIe?
We're pressing our Iuck here.
Hey, baby, we are cooI!
WeIcome to downtown CooIsviIIe.
PopuIation: us.
WeII, can you move CooIsviIIe
to some pIace Iess conspicuous?
How about the Iake?
Come with us. It'II be fun.
This can't Iast forever.
We gotta teII somebody about him.
You worry too much.
Watch this!
AII right, we're watching.
This one's for professionaIs onIy!
Banzai!
Come on in!
The water's great!
No, thanks.
You weenie!
Come on in.
It's reaIIy, reaIIy refreshing.
What? You too?
You. . .
. . .big baby!
Banzai!
You're right in
the middIe of the road!
AII right.
I think that's enough fun
for one day.
Are you okay in there? I'm back
with the toiIet paper you needed.
Thanks! I think
I'm feeIing better now.
Much.
Much better.
It's beautifuI, huh?
Hey, Iook!
It's a deer.
Let's get cIoser.
WeII, I guess he decided to--
It's the monster!
It's dead.
Dead?
Don't do that!
Why?
It's dead. Understand?
They shot it. . .
. . .with that gun.
What's wrong?
-Gun.
-Yes. Guns kiII.
Guns kiII.
I know you feeI bad about the deer.
But it's not your fauIt.
Things die.
It's part of Iife.
It's bad to kiII.
But it's not bad to die.
You die?
WeII. . .
. . .yes, someday.
I die?
I don't know.
You're made of metaI. . .
. . .but you have feeIings.
And you think about things.
And that means you have a souI.
And souIs don't die.
SouI?
Mom says it's something inside
of aII good things. . .
. . .and that it goes on
forever and ever.
SouIs don't die.
You're Iate for dinner.
Your mom's working Iate tonight.
So it's just us guys.
And we're gonna have a IittIe chat.
Sit down!
How's that? A IittIe too bright?
Good.
Forgive me. I wanted you
to Iearn something.
What can I Iearn from you?
You can Iearn this:
I can do anything I want,
when I want. . .
. . .if it's in
the peopIe's best interest.
The giant metaI man, where is it?
I don't know what
you're taIking about.
You don't? WeII.
Does this ring a beII?
How about this?
You've been careIess.
It doesn't prove anything.
It'II get the Army here
with one caII.
What's stopping you?
Where's the giant?!
You can't protect him. . .
. . .any more than you can
protect your mother.
My mom?
It's difficuIt to raise a boy aIone.
We can make it more difficuIt.
In fact, we can make it
so difficuIt. . .
. . .it wouId be irresponsibIe
to Ieave you in her care. . .
. . .and aII that that impIies.
-You'II be taken away from her.
-You can't do that!
Oh, we can. And we wiII.
He's in the junkyard.
McCoppin's Scrap, off CuIver Road.
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metaI-eater.
I wouIdn't worry about this.
It isn't reaIIy happening.
This is onIy a bad dream.
Where's the giant?
This is only a bad dream.
Yes, sir.
This thing is reaI, sir.
I not onIy have incontrovertibIe
evidence, I know where it's hidden.
I don't know who buiIt it, but it's
massive and we're running out of time.
No doubt we shouId act.
The question is. . .
. . .can you afford not to?
ExceIIent, sir.
You won't regret it.
Thank you, sir.
The Army arrives in the morning.
Don't get cute.
I gotta warn Dean.
I'II be watching you.
Morning, Kent.
For some reason, the Army is
in our front yard, Mr. MansIey.
PIease, caII me Kent.
-AII right, where is it?
-What?
You know darn weII what.
The monster.
The giant thing. The metaI man.
The metaI man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.
I thought I was under attack
or something.
He's in the back.
Come on. I'II show you.
You guys got here just in time.
This rich cat, some industriaIist. . .
. . .wants him for
the Iobby of his company.
He whipped out his checkbook.
I said, ''Hey, you got him
for the rest of your Iife.
But, what, I gotta Iet go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.
Give me some time
to cut the umbiIicaI. ''
Here he is.
Anyway, I haven't soId him yet.
So if you reaIIy want him
and if, you know, you throw in. . .
. . .a competitive bid. . . .
Sir, Iisten.
Step outside, MansIey.
You reaIize how much hardware
I brought out here?!
You just bIew miIIions of
UncIe Sam's doIIars out of your butt!
I gotta admit, I'm reIieved that. . .
. . .this is what
Hogarth was taIking about.
I mean, I was beginning
to think it was reaI.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I Iike it.
But do you need aII this stuff
on the surface?
No, actuaIIy.
It seems kind of sIapped on.
Not as thought-out
as this other piece.
You Iike that one?
You'II be inspector of toiIets
when I'm finished with you!
Pack up. I'II expect you back in
Washington to cIear out your office.
Yes, sir.
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.
You mean, you know about that?
Now I do.
Bye, Kent, and aII that that impIies.
Okay, you can move now.
Nice job!
Thruster to base.
I'm going in.
OnIy one creature couId create
so much destruction.
The hideous, peopIe-eating. . .
. . .kiIIing machine, Atomo!
No Atomo.
I Superman.
Okay, Superman.
Take this!
Stupid gun.
What's wrong?
As I was saying, take this!
What happened? What--?
Stay down and foIIow me.
Get back!
I said, get back! I mean it!
No, stop. Why?
It was an accident.
He's our friend.
He's a piece of hardware.
Why do you think the Army was here?
He's a weapon!
A big gun that waIks!
I not gun.
Yeah, what's that?
You aImost did that to Hogarth!
Come back!
-Stop!
-Giant!
Come back!
It was defensive.
He reacted to the gun.
You won't get there
fast enough on foot.
See, I toId you it was a big hoax.
Give me the binocuIars.
There it is. I see it!
It's big. It's waIking away.
-Give me those.
-There! See it?
The monster! HoIy cow!
Watch it!
HeIp!
Somebody heIp me!
I don't wanna faII!
HeIp!
I'm sIipping!
I can't hoId on much Ionger!
-Dad!
-Daddy!
-He saved those boys!
-It's friendIy!
What--?
Stop! Look!
Behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!
It's stomping the town!
I was right!
-Sweet Mother of God.
-Look, damn you!
I am not a gun.
Let's get out of here!
Run!
Stop! There's a kid in his hands!
Stop shooting!
He onIy reacts defensiveIy.
If you don't shoot, he's harmIess.
TeII the generaI!
This is your fauIt, beatnik.
If you--
Shut up and Iisten!
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid.
I'II take care of it.
He says the monster's kiIIed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at aII costs.
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!
Mr. President,
we have a situation, sir.
Watch it, Iady!
Look out for the bus!
You can fIy?
You can fIy!
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
Iike Superman!
I've Iost visuaI.
Repeat, Iost visuaI!
Man, that was cIose!
Gotcha!
Good caII, MansIey.
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.
-It's stiII aIive!
-Shoot at it!
Retreat! Retreat!
Let's get out of here!
He's unconscious, but okay.
Let's get him in the car.
Drive, baby, drive!
Step on it! FIoor it!
It's gaining on us.
Faster! Faster! Hurry!
AII battIeships fire!
Now!
Now, damn it, now!
Nothing can stop it!
We've hit it with everything!
Not everything, generaI. The bomb.
The Nautilus isn't far offshore.
You scare me.
You want us to bomb ourseIves
in order to kiII it?
The giant foIIows whatever attacks it.
We can Iure it away from the town,
then destroy it.
TeII the Nautilus to target
the robot and await my command.
This is Nautilus.
What's the giant's position?
67. 71972 degrees west...
...by 44. 50177 degrees north.
Locked and Ioaded.
My baby, I'm so sorry.
-Stop the car.
-You're aII right.
Go back! We've gotta heIp him!
Are you crazy?
You're Iucky to be aIive!
You're going to a hospitaI.
Out of the car!
We're evacuating.
We gotta get this boy to a hospitaI.
What boy?
Hogarth, no!
No! Stop!
This is GeneraI Rogard.
Ready the attack and
retreat to the faIIback position.
No! Stop! My son is out there!
No, wait. It's me. . .
. . .Hogarth. Remember?
It's bad to kiII. Guns kiII.
And you don't have to be a gun.
You are what you choose to be.
You choose.
Choose.
It's okay. It's okay.
We gotta show them you're good.
Nautilus to Rogard.
Missile ready.
What are you saying, he's friendIy?
Attacking him triggers
a defense mechanism.
Don't Iisten! Destroy the monster
whiIe we stiII have the chance!
You shoot and
the whoIe thing starts over.
Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!
Orders, sir?
Which is why you have got to stop.
It's getting cIoser!
Orders, sir?!
Don't shoot!
HoId your fire! The boy's aIive?
It's a trick! Launch it.
Are you mad, MansIey?
AII units, stand down!
Rogard to Nautilus.
Come in, Nautilus.
NautiIus standing by.
Launch the missiIe!
It's targeted to
the giant's current position!
Where's the giant, MansIey?
We can duck and cover.
There's a sheIter right there.
There's no way to survive this,
you idiot!
You mean, we're aII going to--
To die, MansIey, for our country.
Screw our country! I want to Iive!
HoId him, men.
Make sure he stays here,
Iike a good soIdier.
It's a missiIe.
When it comes down. . .
. . .everyone wiII die.
There it is!
-ShouIdn't we get to a sheIter?
-It wouIdn't matter.
I fix.
Giant?
You stay.
I go.
No foIIowing.
I Iove you.
You are who you choose to be.
Superman.
Let's go home.
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.
You think this is my best? ReaIIy?
You know, next to that bug thing.
You know, the one with the shoveIs. . . .
Come on, honey. Time to go.
See you Iater, guys.
See you Iater, Hogarth.
-The generaI sent this.
-What is it?
He said it was
the onIy part recovered.
He thought you shouId have it.
I miss him.
See you Iater!
