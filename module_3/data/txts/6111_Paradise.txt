Hey! Your mother's looking for you.
If I'd known you wanted me to work
on my day off, I wouldn't have come.
And what have you done?
Fridge, ice machine, decorations.
The decking and the chairs
could do with a wipe, though.
By the way, you look sexy as hell in
those gloves.
What?
See how I've still got it?
Really? Florence!
Yeah?
Nothing.
Patrice.
Hey.
Is it OK if I go now?
I need to get ready.
Yeah. You need your other half
to help you get changed?
He's only getting in my way.
No, you keep him here.
I'm picking Nelly up on the way,
and my mum will be at the house.
What's it like to be popular?
Bye!
All right, see you later!
Enjoy!
Bye!
Hey, Tiana.
Girl, you should've been here
five minutes ago.
We've got plenty of time.
Ha! That's all right for you,
you're the festival queen,
and I'm the maid smelling of fish.
I need longer to get ready!
You don't smell of fish.
OK, I lied.
Table seven.
Thank you.
Oh, you made it!
Yes!
I'll get you a drink, sir.
Hey!
Jack, good to see you, man.
Yeah, my first Mahi Mahi festival.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Well, I'll warn you,
it goes on late and has been known
to get a bit messy.
Oh, well, in that case...
It's only a week to the wedding.
Shouldn't you be pacing yourself?
I'll tell you what,
I'll stay two drinks behind you.
There you go.
Great.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
My beautiful daughter
is getting ready to be Mama D'Mer.
Turn around, show us.
Hm, not bad.
Considering what you had to work
with!
You look beautiful.
The tradition is Mama D'Mer
will make an offering to the ocean
in return for the mahi-mahi fish.
That seems fair. What's in this
offering?
Bread, flowers and rum.
Of course!
Not much happens out here
that doesn't involve rum.
OK. You're good?
I'm good.
OK.
So, Mama D'Mer,
you got everything?
Um, no sneaky swigs on the way.
Promise.
Good luck, girl.
Bye!
Bye!
She's coming!
Hey!
Tiana!
Tiana!
Tiana!
Go on. Go on, Tiana!
Go on, Ti!
Tiana!
Oh, look at my baby!
She get off all right?
Yeah, everything all good.
Go on, Ti!
Something's wrong.
What's happening?
Nelly.
Come on, Harrison!
Harrison!
Come on, come on.
Tiana?
Tiana?
Ti!
Tiana!
Tiana.
Ti...
What's happening? Tiana!
Ti!
Tiana!
Tiana.
Tiana...
No, no, no, no, no, no...
She can't be much older than my
Siobhan.
It makes no sense.
Every person in this village loved
her.
They all watched her grow up.
She was the girlfriend
of Patrice's mate.
Yes. Harrison.
Harrison, stop!
Poor fella.
You don't want to see her like that!
Well, it looks like she was killed
by a single stab wound.
The blade is wide, too.
Maybe an inch in diameter.
We've cleared the area, sir.
OK, Ruby. When you're finished
documenting the scene,
gather her immediate family and
friends.
We need to talk to them.
Yes, sir.
Just so you know, sir, Tiana's
mother appears to have gone.
And she was here when the boat
arrived, but hasn't been seen since.
Really?
Well, I'm sure she was distraught.
See if you can track her down.
Yeah.
You said Mama D'Mer offers the ocean
rum, bread and flowers
in exchange for fish.
Yes.
Well, we've got the rum
and the flowers, but no bread.
That's odd.
Yeah.
Do you think Tiana could have thrown
it in to the sea?
Well, usually, they wait until
the boat is around the headland,
where everyone can see.
Well, if she didn't throw it
out of the boat, where is it?
Please, come in and take a seat.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
All of you.
Sir, this is Harrison Green,
Tiana's boyfriend,
and Ellen Dubois.
Nelly.
She was Tiana's best friend.
So, Nelly,
it was you who saw Tiana off on her
boat from beyond the headland?
We got ready at her house,
then I drove her to the old jetty.
And you actually saw her set off on
the boat?Yes. She was fine.
She waved and started heading
out to sea.
Was anyone else there?
No, it was just us.
I can show you.
I've been filming the whole day.
It's on my phone.
It is.
Your phone says 5.47.
How long would it take her
to get around the headland by boat?
Since the tide was against her
a little bit...
...three minutes, maybe.
And did you see anybody else
in the water?
Other boats, swimmers, maybe?
No.
We'll need to keep this for a while.
And, Harrison, yourself and Tiana,
had you been together long?
I've known her all my life.
Um, grew up together.
It was only ever her.
She worked for you, Patrice,
at the bar?
Evenings and weekends.
I mean, she started here
when she was, what, 17?
Customers loved her.
She made more in tips
than she did wages.
Did any of you notice anything
unusual over the last few days?
She was the same as always.
Happy.
Well, I feel I've troubled you
more than enough for now.
Oh, one more thing.
Um...
Who packed Tiana's bag?
The offerings for the sea.
She did it here, at the bar.
And is there any way she might have
forgotten to put the bread in?
I mean, is that a possibility?
No, I gave her the bread from my
kitchen, and the bottle of rum.
Someone must have taken it out,
then.
Well, if it was not there, then...
I guess so.
Hm. Thank you for your time.
Sorry. About everything.
Well, we've seen the video Nelly
took of Tiana leaving at 5.47.
Let's have a look at the video
I took.
Right, there she is, rounding
the headland, at, what, 5.50?
Nelly has her leaving at 5.47,
that's...three minutes.
That's not an awful lot of time
to make it around the bay.
So how did whoever killed Tiana
manage to board a boat mid-journey
and stab her?
Well, there were no other boats
or swimmers in the water
on any of the footage we've got.
And if it only took three minutes,
there wasn't time for Tiana
to stop off somewhere on the way.
Exactly. So, how?
Oh!It's OK.
You don't have to put up your
hand.Sorry.
But what about a diver?
Now, Nelly said there were no other
boats or swimmers,
but she wouldn't have seen a diver
because they go under the water.
So I would like to propose
that a diver was waiting.
He saw the boat go over him,
swam to the surface,
grabbed the side of the boat,
stabbed Tiana and then dived back
down to the murky depths from whence
he came.
It is the only explanation.
True.
But the boat was bone-dry.
If someone climbed on board from
the sea, it would've been wet.
Dammit.
What happened out there?
JP?
Yes, we're on our way.
He's found Louise Palmer.
Good.
She's drunk.
She wanted more,
but I refused to serve her.
Why?
We were good friends once.
But when she found out
her husband was having an affair,
she started to drink.
I thought she was getting some help.
Louise is a recovering alcoholic.
And you know her well?
We lost touch,
until she came in this week.
Any reason for losing touch?
I run a bar...
Mrs Palmer?
Louise...
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry!
Oh, now,
what have you got to be sorry for?
We can't speak to her like this.
JP, take her home, please.
Yes, sir.
All right, Mrs Palmer,
I'm just going to lift you up here.
All right. Oops, sorry.
OK, come along.
OK.
Catherine,
you said you hadn't seen her
until this week, not today.
Yes.
She was here last Friday.
Was she?
And how did she seem?
Not good.
She'd obviously been drinking again,
and I had to call Tiana
to come and pick her up.
Come on, Mama, come on.
I know you're leaving me.
Yeah, well, it can't come soon
enough.
And I thought you loved me!
It's OK. I'll take her home.
I'm sorry!
Have you any idea
what they were arguing about?
No.
But Tiana is Louise's life.
She'd never hurt her.
Well, Florence, what do you think?
Um...
Well, you look very smart.
Well, I didn't want to let the side
down at your wedding.
Oh, I called the Belle Mer harbour
master first thing this morning,
asked him to check his radar logs.
He confirmed there were no other
vessels in the vicinity at the time
the victim's boat left the jetty
and headed for the harbour.
So... Ow!
Sorry, Inspector.
It seems to be a new thing to have
here -
acupuncture, with a free suit
thrown in.
You all done?
Yeah.
Morning, Ruby. JP.
Morning, sir.
Excellent, you've got the board
ready.
Yeah, Ruby did it.
She came in early.
Very early.
So, I have a photo of Patrice.
I mean, usually,
I'd put it up on the board,
but under the circumstances, I...
Florence,
should we include your fiance
as a possible murder suspect?
I think I can vouch for him.
OK.
So, what have we got here?
Tiana Palmer, only 22.
Born and raised in Belle Mer.
Well, not born here,
but she was raised here.
Bradley and Louise Palmer
adopted her when she was two.
Adopted?
Her birth parents around?
No, she came from an orphanage
on the south side of the island.
A very popular girl,
by all accounts.
No obvious reason
why anyone would want to harm her.
OK, well, let's start
with the people closest to her.
OK, Harrison Green,
Tiana's boyfriend.
Age 26.
Lives at home with his parents
and runs a family business.
Pretty much the only water-taxi
in Belle Mer.
Harrison and Tiana grew up
on the same road together.
Their families are really close.
I ran a finance check.
Harrison's private accounts
aren't too healthy.
Direct debit payments to two credit
cards.
I'm just waiting for details on
those.
He was helping out at Patrice's bar
the whole time, wasn't he?
I think so, but I can check with
Patrice.
Great. OK, next we have Ellen.
Nelly Dubois.
Tiana's best friend.
21 years old.
One of four children,
but the only girl.
The Dubois family have had fishing
boats there for over nine
generations,
and Nelly recently set up
her own fishing boat.
I think she's in stiff competition
with her brothers.
Well, she was the last person
to see Tiana Palmer alive.
And the victim's mother.
Louise Palmer, recovering alcoholic.
I've heard Harrison talk about her.
Very protective about Tiana.
Yet we know from Catherine she had a
fight with Tiana just last Friday.
Might help to know
what that was all about.
These people
were all on that harbour-side,
so would've had to leave and come
back
as the body was discovered.
OK...
Let's make sure they're all
accounted for
between, say, 5.30 and 6pm.
Um, sir,
I checked Tiana's financial records,
and she had savings,
but last week she paid 300
to Paradise Homes,
a local letting agency.
Now, I called them this morning,
and they said
that it was 50% of a deposit.
So Tiana was leaving her mum's
house.
It looks like it.
What did Catherine hear
Tiana say to Louise?
"It can't come soon enough."
Maybe that was it.
They were arguing about Tiana moving
out.
Well, we should speak to her mum
first.
Hopefully, she'll have sobered up.
JP, you and Ruby come too.
See if you can find anything
in Tiana's room while we're there.
Yes, sir.
I don't normally drink.
I'm an alcoholic.
But I guess you already know that.
Well, it's not our place to judge
you, Louise.
But I do need to ask you
about last Friday.
We spoke to Catherine.
Oh.
She told us about the argument
you had with Tiana.
It was about Tiana moving out, yeah?
I didn't want her to go.
Course you didn't.
Once they go, they never come back,
do they?
So you were angry that she was
leaving?
I try real hard...
...but that night I had a drink.
And I'm not nice when I'm drunk.
Did you hit her?
I thought you loved me!
She knew how sorry I was,
how ashamed.
Was she still planning to move out?
Yes.
And why shouldn't she?
She and Harrison were
a lovely couple.
Is anything wrong, Ruby?
Oh! No. Why?
Should there be?
No...
OK, question.
On a scale of one to 100,
how wrong is it to lust over
a murder victim's boyfriend?
20?
30?
He is a murder suspect,
and you are a police officer.
OK, 45?
But have you seen his thighs,
though, JP?
I mean, you could crack a coconut
between them.
Let's just concentrate
on doing the work, OK?
Oh, I know, we've got to be
professional.
Excuse me for sharing.
What are you doing now, Ruby?
She was a girl who lived with her
mother. You have to hide things.
It's a phone number.
Could be important.
So...
...could these.
You know who she is?
Great, thanks.
Tiana died within minutes
from a single stab wound,
probably from a knife like that.
Oh, the Harrison Green
credit card reports JP asked for.
Both maxed out.
So, he'd reached his overdraft.
His cards were maxed out.
Not a great time
to put a deposit on a new house.
These look like
mostly ATM cash withdrawals.
Why did he need so much cash?
I don't know. We could ask him.
Unless he's got something to hide,
in which case,
we might just get a pack of lies.
But maybe someone else might know
what's going on in his life.
Who?
His best friend.
All right, lads. Yourselves?
Up to mischief? Ha-ha!
Hey, you finished early.
I need to talk to you about
Harrison.
OK.
You've known him since you were
children, right?
We went to school together.
I can't remember a time I didn't
know him.
So he confides in you?
Sometimes.
Look, what is this? Is he in
trouble?No, no, it's just
routine, I promise.
We just need to build a picture
of everyone who knew Tiana.
Has he...has he talked to you
about the business?
Um, a bit.
I mean, I know things weren't great,
but he'll get through it.
He also used his ATM card
to take out a lot of cash.
Have you any idea why?
Wait, you go through
his private accounts?
Well, it's a murder inquiry,
Patrice. We go through everything.
Well, I don't know why
he's been taking the money out.
Is that it?
Grilling over?
One last thing.
The day of the festival,
can you remember seeing Harrison
between 5.30 and six?
Thanks, fellas.
See you Thursday.
All right, bye.
Oh, my dominoes gang.
How did you get on?
Patrice confirmed
Harrison has a few money worries.
He also said that he can't say for
sure he saw him on the harbour-side
between 5.30 and six.
Interesting. Well, I think I might
have an idea
about his money troubles.
Oh?
My guys think he owes money
to a local loan shark.
We've been trying to find Pee-wee
Paul for nearly three months.
There's a Guadeloupe arrest warrant
out for him, for ABH at a house
party.
So Pee-wee's a bit
of a slippery customer, is he?
Lots of people owe him money,
so he has plenty of places to hide.
Well, he may know something we
don't, so let's see if we can track
him down.
Any joy with that phone number you
found in the victim's room?
Er, yes, it's the number
for the Maritime Authority Office,
but I can't get through to them
at the moment.
What do they do?
Oh, they license the fishing boats,
monitor their catches,
make sure the boats are seaworthy.
And why would Tiana have their
number in her bedroom?
Keep trying, JP.
Who is this?
Oh, so I checked with Louise,
and it's Tiana Palmer's birth
mother, Marie Forrest.
It was with Tiana
when she was left at the orphanage.
And has she been in touch since
then?No.
Right.
OK, where were we?
Right, what about her computer?
Not much here either. I mean,
she deleted all of her history.
But I did find one weird thing,
though.
Oh?
Well, she e-mailed herself
a lot of photos on Saturday.
What of?
Well, that's the thing.
There were a lot of selfies,
but right in the middle, there were
photos of the harbour at Belle Mer.
Who takes snaps of somewhere they've
lived for the whole of their life?
Well, that's what I thought.
Well, let's just add that
to the list of things in this case
that don't make any sense.
And you're sure you've never seen
this man before, no?
OK.
All right.
This is ridiculous, Ruby.
How can no-one have seen Pee-wee?
Well, if he knows there's a warrant
out for his arrest,
he's not going to make himself
easy to find.
Yeah, but the man's a loan shark.
Surely someone hates him enough
to give him up, no?
So...
...you still got the hots
for our murder suspect?
No. Yes.
And before you say it, JP,
I know that it's not professional,
but not everyone
can be perfect like you, can we?
Well...
...what if I was to say
that I met my Rosey while on duty
and working a case?
No!
No way.
Yes. It's very, very true.
I mean, I originally did know her
from school,
but I don't even think she noticed
me back then.
Until all these years later,
she sees you in your police uniform,
and all her bells started ringing...
It's just sweet, JP.
But that's not my point, Ruby.
The thing is,
it's not about us being perfect.
You see, all the other stuff,
they're going to crop up.
But when we're working,
we concentrate more on the job.
OK?
OK.
I always knew you had a naughty side
to you, JP.
Dating a suspect in a murder case,
look at you!
Bad man!
All right!
Yes, sire.
Having fun?
Oh, yeah, they're a lovely bunch.
Give you their last penny, soon as
it's stolen off of somebody else.
And did they knew where Pee-wee was?
Oh, yes.
Odile! How the devil are you?
You'll be back at the bingo on
Saturday?Yes, of course.
Great!
Hit me.
Go on, then. Go on.
You'll be Pee-wee, I assume. Police.
Get the money!
Good job I was the under-nines
cross-country champion.
Agh!
Sarge?
Are you running?
Stay where you are!
I think he must be coming your way.
Look!
That isn't a man, that's a mountain!
All right.
Pee-wee!
Stop!
We just want to chat!
Hey, hey, hey. OK, wait, stop. Stop,
stop!
Agh!
Come on, get up!
Aaah!
Hang on, girl!
Hang on!
Help me, I can't get off!
Hey, put her down!
No, no, no, no!
Ruby!
Are you OK?
Ruby's fine,
but I don't think he can swim.
Stop!
What we have here, Pee-wee,
is a simple choice.
Be charged with resisting arrest
and assault on a police officer
or a bacon sandwich.
Now, how about you tell me
everything you know
about Harrison Green?
Deal.
Oh, is there any chance
that Louise can get Tiana's tips?
She needs all the help she can get.
I mean, I wouldn't ask, but...
No, of course.
But they wouldn't be that much help,
it was only 10.
Ten?!
Oh, she said she had over 650
the day before she died.
This makes 650!
It's your smile, gold-plated.
OK, leave it with me,
I'll tell the Inspector.
OK.
OK?
Morning.
Morning, Sarge.
Sir, according to Patrice,
Tiana had over 600 in her tips box.
And how much did we find in her
locker?About ten and some coins.
Well, now, that makes what I just
heard even MORE interesting.
Harrison Green has just paid Pee-wee
an instalment of 600.
Apparently, he's got a gambling
problem. He's an addict.
Harrison? A gambler?
What, you didn't know that?
No, I didn't, and I don't think
Patrice does either.
Yeah, not a very successful one.
That's why he has so many credit
cards. Wait till you hear this.
Last week, he bet his family's
water-taxi business,
and he lost it!
Pee-wee bailed him out for a price,
now he's in it up to his neck.
You think Harrison stole from Tiana.
Well, we should ask him,
don't you think?
She said if I didn't tell her the
truth, we were finished.
So?
I told her everything.
And did you tell her
that you almost gambled away
your family's business?
We spoke to Pee-wee.
Like I said...
...I told her everything.
We spent all night talking about it.
She forgave me.
Said we'd face everything together.
Like a real couple.
She told me to keep the tips
that I'd taken from her.
Told me to use them towards paying
for the half of the house.
Which you haven't actually done yet.
We were going to go in together
the day after the festival.
Harrison, is there anyone
who can verify
exactly where you were
between 5.30 and 6pm
on the day Tiana was killed?
Yes.
Patrice.
Well, now, to be fair...
...Patrice says he thinks
you were at the bar...
...but he didn't actually
see you there.
You think I killed her?
No.
No, I don't.
But it's our job to find out
what happened to her.
I loved her.
You know that, Florence.
You OK?
What did they want?
They think I killed her.
What?! Don't be ridiculous!
And you know what?
It didn't help you saying
you never saw me here
when she was getting on the boat.
You know I was here!
No, no, no, it wasn't like that.
Oh, no?
Then how come it feels like
I got you on one side
and your girlfriend on the other?
I feel terrible.
You mustn't, Florence,
you're doing your best.
We're trying to be as thorough as we
can. We owe it to poor Tiana.
Any news?
Nothing new, sir.
Well, maybe we should look
at the videos again.
So, this was taken at 5.47pm.
We can see Tiana, clearly alive.
The bay's completely empty,
nothing in sight.
Not a boat nor man.
Your video was taken at 5.50pm.
She's a slumped forward there, look.
So she's already been stabbed
before she came into view.
It must've taken everything she had
to steer herself around the headland
to try and get some help.
So...
She left the jetty here
to start her journey.
By the time she gets here,
only three minutes later,
she's been stabbed.
Despite there being clearly
no other boats in the area
and not a single person in the
water.
And no time for her to stop on the
way.
So just how the hell did our killer
do it?
And, lest we forget,
why was the loaf of bread taken
from her bag?
Was it the killer who took it?
I can't think why anyone else
would steal it.
But why would they take it?
Souvenir?
I assume we all agree
this wasn't some bizarre bread
robbery that went wrong.
Argh! I give up!
Ah, now, don't say that, Ruby.
We never give up.
No, the photos
that she took at the harbour.
I mean, they're just so out of
place. Look at this. Selfie.
Selfie. Selfie. Lobster pot?
Florence, your dad's a fisherman.
Anything special from these photos
you can see?
Hmm. It's a trawling net.
A bottom trawler. You see those
wheels?
They drag the net across the seabed,
smashing coral,
destroying everything in its path.
It's illegal.
And what happens
if you're caught using one of these?
Huge fine,
prison in some cases,
but either way, they'd never be able
to fish again.
So if somebody was illegal trawling,
and Tiana became aware of it.
And that's why she had the number
for the Maritime Authority.
Yes, JP.
And killing someone to save yourself
from prison,
well, that's a better motive
than we have so far.
The last person to see the victim
alive runs her own fishing boat.
Nelly Dubois.
OK, well, thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
Well, how'd you get on?
JP was amazing.
I swear, he morphed into, like,
Denzel Washington or something.
Even I believed him.
Chief, I just told her that we had
reports
of someone using a bottom trawler
on the reef,
and so, could she keep an eye out
for us?
She acted like she was horrified.
See you.
Oh! She's on the move.
JP, Ruby, you check the hut.
Florence and I will follow her.
Hello, Nelly.
Look, it's not what looks like.
Hm.
Looks like you're using an illegal
trawling net to catch fish.
OK, so it is what it looks like.
So, why do it?
Look, I come from a fishing family.
You know, my dad fishes,
my three brothers fish,
my five uncles fish,
and all I've ever heard
is that it's a man's job.
You know,
that girls should be in the kitchen,
you know, cooking the fish,
not out on the water catching them.
And you thought you'd prove them
wrong.
I DID prove them wrong.
Just until the last couple of
months,
when my catches started to drop.
I was coming home empty
and having to watch them coming back
bursting at the seams.
It must be extra hard being a woman
working on your own.
It's no harder for me than anyone
else.
I had a run of bad luck, that's all.
How did you know?
A photo Tiana took.
Tiana knew?
She didn't speak to you about it?
No.
No, she never said anything.
Hold on, you...
...you can't think I had anything to
do with her death.
Well, if she did know about it
and she reported you,
you could have gone to prison.
And brought shame
on the rest of your family.
Quite a motive.
What a day.
I think I need a very cold beer.
What's happened?
Is this what it's going to be like
being married to a police officer?
Harrison told me what you said to
him.
That I said I couldn't vouch for
him.
I was doing my job.
What, by using the things
I told you in confidence?
No, no, you didn't tell me
"in confidence".
It wasn't pillow talk, OK?
I was interviewing you
about a murder,
the murder of someone
you cared about!
He thinks I betrayed him!
Did you tell me the truth?
Of course.
Then how can that be wrong?
Harrison is not a killer.
I've known him all my life.
There isn't a violent bone
in his body.
He's good. He's kind, gentle.
You can't seriously think he killed
Tiana.
Right now?
I don't know.
Patrice.
There you are.
A month before Kathleen and I got
married, we nearly split up.
It was her birthday, you see.
I had forgotten to get her
a birthday present.
Well, I didn't forget exactly.
I was on a murder inquiry in
Reading, at a motorway service
station.
Well, there wasn't much choice.
What did you get her?
A get well card,
um, a toy monkey - yes -
and a neck cushion.
And she wasn't pleased?
No, she was apoplectic.
Yeah.
And the funny thing is,
it wasn't the presents so much.
The thing that upset her
was where I bought them.
That I wouldn't stop working
for five minutes and put her first.
She thought that was a sign,
you see,
that the job I do would always be
more important to me than her.
I'm sure that wasn't true.
We stayed up until sunrise...
...just talking.
And by the end of it,
we knew each other a lot better
than we ever did before.
Patrice must be worried sick
about Harrison, that's all.
He'll sleep on it
and see he's being unreasonable.
And what if he doesn't?
Well, then you have to stay up
until sunrise talking about it
until he does!
Yeah.
Well, I think I'm not cut
out to be married.
No-one's cut out to be married.
You sort of have to just bend
yourself into shape.
Yeah, but, hm...
I like my independence.
Yeah, but you can still be
independent,
just with somebody else.
But I'm happy being single.
Good!
How can you be happy being married
if you're not happy being single?
What?!
Sorry, but what does that mean?
I have no idea.
It's the beer talking.
Oh.
Do you love Patrice?
Yes, I do.
Can you imagine a life
that doesn't include Patrice?
No.
Well, there you go.
From such a little thing - acorn -
does the mighty oak of marriage
grow.
The mighty oak of marriage?
Yeah.
Life's not something to be scared of
or worried about.
It's something you grab
with both hands.
Yep.
Which kind of answers my next
question.
Which is?
To refill...
...or to call a cab?
No contest.
Thank you.
To grabbing life with both hands.
Ah, cheers.
Morning.
Are you suffering?
No, I'm fine.
Just someone's taken all the liquid
out of my body.
Well, I got you a hot sweet coffee,
and Catherine has made you
a bacon sandwich with brown sauce,
whatever that is.
Well, bless her, but I don't think
I'm ready for food just yet.
OK.
Morning!
Morning, sir. Sarge.
Morning.
All right.
Is he all right?
I think he's a little hungover.
If you guys could take over
until my face stops hurting...
OK, so our victim is Tiana Palmer,
murdered on the sea
while playing Mama D'Mer
at the Belle Mer Mahi Mahi festival.
Tiana Palmer was last seen alive
at 5.47pm, leaving the old jetty,
which was close to the Belle Mer
headland.
She was next seen at 5.50,
as she rounded the headland.
In the three minutes it took for her
to reach that point,
she was stabbed once,
in the chest here,
yet we have no
idea how our killer managed
to somehow board her moving boat
out at sea
and commit the murder.
Sir? Any thoughts happening over
there?
What?
Yes.
Yes, I do have a thought.
I am thinking I will chance my arm
with that bacon sandwich,
if you don't mind.
Thank you, Florence.
Er...
...what's happened to Inspector
Mooney? He's frozen into a statue.
Sir, are you OK?
All comes down to the bread.
On the bacon sandwich?
No, the bread in Tiana's bag.
Or rather the bread
that WASN'T in Tiana's bag.
But if someone gave her some bread,
like you gave me this bacon butty,
Florence,
well, then she'd have to take it,
because Tiana didn't have any bread.
Mama D'Mer!
You got everything?
We've got the rum and the flowers,
but no bread.
That's odd.
And, well, THAT'S how
she was killed!
They just needed the opportunity,
that's all.
It's on my phone.
But she wouldn't do it
herself, why would she?
OK, Nelly's phone,
have we still got it?
Er, yes!
Here.
Right under our noses all the time.
Ruby, I need you to do
some fingerprint checking for me.
Quick as you can, please.
Yes.
JP, where are the photos you took
of Tiana's bedroom?
Ah.
Yep, right here, sir.
Right. Of course.
Of course!
Look how tidy it is.
Florence, round them up, will you?
And, Ruby, meet us there,
at Patrice's bar,
as soon as you're done.
Yes, sir.
Wait!
Has anyone got any paracetamol?
This case has been a bundle of
conundrums since the very start.
A murder taking place
on a boat impossible to get to
without being seen,
a boat impossible to reach from
the sea without it getting wet,
and all happening
in an impossibly tiny window
of opportunity.
The biggest conundrum of all -
the murder of someone
who everyone loved.
Genuinely loved.
But there's Tiana's mother,
who thinks
she's about to lose her daughter,
driven to the brink
by the fear of abandonment.
And her best friend,
guilty of illegal trawling,
devastating the ocean floor,
something she knew
Tiana would find unforgivable.
In fact, it was something we now
know she was about to report.
And her boyfriend.
Her childhood sweetheart.
The man who stole money from her
to help clear his gambling debts.
I told you already. Tiana and I, we
talked about it. We sorted it out.
Oh, yes, that's right.
You told Florence here that you were
about to move in together.
Yes, the day after
she was Mama D'Mer,
we were going to put everything
else behind us.
Well, now, you see,
I think that's half true.
I think Tiana had put everything
behind her,
and I think she finished with you
when she found out about your
gambling
and that you'd stolen money from
her.Rubbish!
You have no idea
what you're talking about.
My officers checked her bedroom.
And I've just studied the
photographs - there isn't a single
shoe out of place.
It certainly doesn't look like the
kind of room
that someone was planning to move
out of a day later.
No. The simple truth is
Tiana realised she didn't know the
man she was about to move in with.
And relationships were strained
to breaking point with her mother,
so she had no-one to confide in.
Patrice, you were a good boss,
but she knew
how close you were to Harrison.
She couldn't talk to you either.
I don't have to listen to this.
Er, yes, you do.
But her big day was coming.
She was going to be Mama D'Mer
at the Mahi Mahi festival.
And I think she told you that you'd
keep all this to yourselves,
all your guilty secrets,
and she wouldn't tell anyone
until after the event.
And that's why you had to kill her.
Because you knew on the following
day you'd lose everything.
This is ridiculous!
How could he possibly have done it?!
Hear me out, Patrice, please.
Please.
How indeed?
Well, first of all, no-one knows
how long a journey by sea will take
better than a water-taxi driver.
You even helpfully told us
how long it would take.
Exactly.
The tide was against her a little
bit.
Three minutes, maybe.
Which means there was no time to do
it.
It was impossible!True. Or at least
that's what you wanted us to think.
But in the end, there's only one
solution.
It didn't only happen
in three minutes.
You bought yourself
the extra five minutes you needed
by changing the clock
on Nelly's phone
so it would look like the video
was recorded later than it was.
Now, I'm not sure when you did this,
but Nelly often leaves her bag
unattended,
and I've just checked her phone -
it's still running five minutes
fast.
Right under our noses all the time.
You forgot to wipe your fingerprints
off Nelly's phone.
Is there any reason why his
fingerprints should be on your
phone, Nelly?
No.
Well, that's wasn't the only thing
you did to prepare, was it?
On the day of the festival,
you had to remove a loaf of bread
from Tiana's bag,
the one she was using
for Mama D'Mer.
I think you slipped away from
the bar at the exact moment
you knew that Nelly here
would be seeing Tiana on her way.
And as soon as Nelly was out of
sight, you called Tiana back to the
shore.
But you needed a reason, a pretext.
Tiana!
You forgot the bread!
Tiana!
Now, the video on Nelly's phone,
it showed her leaving at 5.47,
but in fact, because you changed
the time on her phone,
it was really only 5.42.
That's how you bought yourself the
time you needed to commit murder.
Ah!
You stabbed her.
But you didn't quite kill her.
She got away.
She knew she needed to get
to where there were people.
And I believe that she used
every last bit of energy she had
to make her way around
that headland,
where she thought
someone might be able to help her.
Meanwhile, you had to ensure
that you were at the harbour-side
when the boat came in,
whatever happened.
And you acted as if nothing had
happened.My baby!
She get off all right?
Yeah, everything all good.
Go on, Ti!
As she died, you thought your
secrets would die with her,
that your family would never
discover
you destroyed the business
through your gambling addiction
and that you were a thief,
and you'd get to play
the grieving boyfriend
instead of having the humiliation
of being dumped by the village girl
who everyone loved.
Tell him it's not true.
Tell him!
You don't understand.
JP, if you could do the honours,
please.
Harrison Green, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Tiana Palmer.
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...
I don't know what to do, he's so
upset.
Well, you just go to him, Florence.
We'll deal with this, OK?
Thank you.
Just listen to me, please.
Look, I know he didn't do this.
We need to do something!
Do you know what's been going on?
Then we need to talk.
Yeah, I know it. 20 minutes.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Look...
I'm sorry.
I know this isn't your fault.
Well, can we talk about this?
Yes. Just...not right now.
There's something I need to do.
What?
I'll tell you later.
Nelly, could I borrow a truck?
It won't be long.
Er...sure.
Sir, I have just heard Patrice
talking on the phone
to someone about Harrison.
He's arranged to meet them.
I think something's going on.
I'm following Patrice in his car,
and we are heading north,
out of Belle Mer.
Please, please call me.
Patrice?
Patrice!
It's me!
Look, whatever it is, I can help,
OK?
Just... Just talk to me.
Do you know something about
Harrison?
Agh!
Agh!
Patrice...
