SHORT CIRCUIT
Maybe I can provide you
with some schematic drawings.
All right.
Who told you could
take Number One?
Logically, if we need protection
from Number Five...
this is the best weapon
we could have.
Great. So, instead of US$11
million on the loose...
we're going to have
twenty-two.
And plus, we are needing
gas money.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I have to draw the line
at snakes.
I'm sure it would make
a wonderful pet, but...
wait, isn't there a home
for cobras somewhere?
Can you hang on
for a second?
Can I call you right back?
Thanks.
Get out of there!
Frank!
Mr. Scumo!
I know you're in there.
Get out!
Or I'll call the cops.
What?
Are you deaf?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! I knew they'd
pick me. I just knew it.
Hello.
Well, I guess...
welcome to my planet.
Is this thrilling or what?
Don't be scared.
I'm a friend.
Friend?
Do you know
the word "friend"?
Because that's what I am.
I'm a friend.
So, here I come.
Nice and extremely friendly.
Hi.
It's me.
So, this is earth.
I'm Stephanie.
Speck.
No offense, but...
is that really you or is that
a space suit...
and you're inside some place,
maybe just your brain...
in a little jar
or something like that?
- Malfunction.
- You can talk!
Malfunction.
Need input.
Input.
That's information.
Listen, I am full of it.
Why don't you come to my house
and we can sit down and talk...
get to know each other.
Communicate. Input.
Come on.
It's okay.
No, no.
I mean come with me.
I mean come here.
This way.
Come here.
Come on. Right this way.
March! Heel! Giddup!
- Forward!
- Forward!
Forward, forward.
Come forward.
That's good.
That's really good.
Don't be afraid, guys.
He's a friend.
These are animals.
They're lower life forms.
They're always a little skittish
around new people, aliens.
Malfunction.
Need input.
Input.
Right, right.
This is a house.
We live inside it.
- We have a floor, see...
- Floor.
And we have the opposite
of a floor...
which is the ceiling.
Look up!
Ceiling.
We have windows and...
air! Look over here.
Light.
Music.
Look at this.
This is a plant.
See?
And these are goldfish.
Don't touch.
Look over there.
These are ants.
They're not aunts,
they're ants.
It's an ant farm.
Look! These are my bunnies.
Edwina and Norman.
Norman.
I bet you got some amazing
animals in your planet.
Good, there you go.
This is Earth, where
we are now.
You are here.

How about pictures?
Do you like pictures?
We have a lot

A lot of them.
This is a picture

See that? It's an aardvark.
- It's a mammal.
- Input. Aardvark.
- Abyssinia, Adams...
- Holy Crowl. You can read.

- Okay, no problem.

No problem.
- My neck.
- Sorry.
This is very healthy
for the neck.
Can you believe it's been
5 years since I've driven?
I'd say ten.
It's all coming
back to me, though.
You know what many people
are liking at night?
- What?
- Headlights.
- It's a lot better. Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
More input, Stephanie.
- More!
- There isn't anymore.
You've read everything
in the house.
Animal.
Mammal, skunk.
That's a container
drinking glass.
Pasta, semolina,
spaghetti.
Look, this may be hilarious
where you come from...
but here it's considered rude.
Ferns, fruits, oranges...
apples, lemons, limes.
That's great.
Thanks a lot.
Fabric.

No, my dishes!
Oh, my God!

Don't we have to find

Pardon me for saying so,

Girls are not my best suits.
We got a job to do.

Beautiful Stephanie.
"S A I N T Prototype
number five...
Nova Robotics. Damon,
Washington". You're a robot?
- Yes.
- I thought you were alive.
I let you tear my house
to shreds and you're a robot!
You're a machine from that dumb
war lab place. I'm so stupid.
Stupid: Foolish, gullible,
doltish...
- dumbbell.
- Shut up!
Shut up: Silence, hush,
sit on it, can it.
Am I the jerk of the world?
You're just programmed.
Jerk of the world, turkey,
idiot, pain in the ass.
I hope you're programmed
to pay for the mess you made.
What if there's a reward
out for that thing?
I could take care of as many
animals as I want.
Hello.
I'd like to speak to one of your
head Warmongers, please.
Dr. Warmonger, Marner.
I think this may be something.
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>I'd likae you to kanow</i>
<i>I have one of your robots.</i>
God!
Good.
Yes.
Listen...
thank you very much
for calling.
Our people are
on their way.
Mount up!
We've got it!
Move! Move! Move!
Today, gentleman, today!
Let's go!
We gotta run away!
Let's go, let's go.
In the meantime,
it's very important...
that you try to keep
a safe distance.
How safe a distance?
Well, see, it's malfunctioning.
We have to disassemble
it and check it out.
It's goofy little gadget.
Try to keep everyone as far away
from it as possible, okay?
Not that it's dangerous
or anything like that.
How much is a contraption
like that worth, anyway?
<i>Worth? I don' kanow.</i>
<i>A few hundred dollars maybe.</i>
No reward or anything
like that for finding it?
Well, we do have a daily tour
of our facilities here.
<i>You kanow, I might even be able</i>
<i>to get you a student discount.</i>
- Hey! It's gone!
- Gone?
Wooly mammals.
Sheep.
Sweaters, mittens.
Nevermind, I see it. Go back
to your nuclear warheads.
Hey, you, Number Five,
What are you doing?
You're gonna scare
my animals, bozo.
Listen, I just called Nova and
they are coming out to get you.
- They'll give you a tune up.
- Tune-up? Input.
They'll take you apart,
find out which screw is loose.
Apart: Undone, dismantle,
dissect, disassemble.
Right.
Jump!
- Look, it's a grasshopper.
- Grasshopper, Orthoptarous insect.
Jump.
That's great.
Okay.
All right, let's go back now.
Come on.
Hey!
Damn it! You klutz!
Look what you did.
Error.
Grasshopper disassembled.
Reassemble.
Reassemble.
I can't reassemble him.
It's dead.
Dead?
Right.
Dead as a doornail.
Reassemble, Stephanie.
Reassemble.
I know you don't understand.
But when you're dead,
you're dead.
That's just the way it is.
Dead is forever.
Squash, dead.
Disassemble, dead!
Disassemble, dead!
Slow down.
- No disassemble.
- Where you going?
- Please, escape.
- Oh, my God!
Hey, you!
Get out of my truck.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Don't.
You open this door
right now.
Get out of my truck,
you thief.
No, don't start my truck.
You don't know how to drive.
Come back here with my truck,
you big hunk of tin.
You can't take my truck.
You better be heavily insured
because you'll find yourself...
slapped with
a humongous lawsuit!
Newton, I'm seeing a blip
on my scope. Drive slowly.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.
Newton, there it goes.
It's moving at extreme velocipede.
Right.
The right.
Accurate, proper,
correct, appropriate.
My side, over here.
Quickly!
- The right.
- Right.
The right.
Look out!
My kitchen!
No!
Where she going? I thought
Howard told her to stay out.
Go figure out chicks, man.
Look out!
Great! Nice work,
cathead.
- Thanks at lot.
- Sorry.
Oh, no. Stop it!
Now stop!
- Turn left.
- Left!
Turn!
Turn!
- Fish!
- Look out!
Salmon!
Sushi.
Jeez, Number Five,
we're going to be killed.
- Disassemble.
- Disassemble all over the place.
Disassemble.
No!
Escape! Escape!
Flee! Hide! Refuge!
What are you afraid of?
What's the matter with you?
Nova Robotics.
Disassemble. Dead.
Disassemble Number Five. Dead.
But you can't die.
You're a machine.
- No.
- No, you're not a machine?
- Yes.
- Yes, you are or you're not?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
Yes, not.
Talk about a malfunction.
Not malfunction, Stephanie.
Number Five is alive.
Just keep going straight.
Just keep going straight.
Okay fine.
We're getting closer.
Ben, we're getting closer.
I can sense it,
I can sense it.
There they are! You see them?
They're right there.
Nova.
Disassemble.
Dead.
Disassemble.
Number Five, dead.
Girlie, girlie, come quick!
Girlie, danger! Come on!
No, no disassemble,
No disassemble,
Number Five.
Come on, you!
What planet
is this guy from?
No disassemble.
Number Five, don't be scared.
Wait here a second.
I'll be right back.
Come on, Number one.
Come on. Very good.
Careful. Moving nicely.
Jeez, another one.
How many of these guys
have you got, anyway?
- You are a girl, right?
- Yes, as far as I know.
Hi.
How you doing?
Your little brother's hiding
in my truck.
I have seen some
strange bizarre drivers...
but you may be
awarded the cake.
Me? Talk to your robot.
He did the driving.
Did you say the robot
drove the truck?
Yeah, that's right, chum.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Bull dyke, you cannot hold
your water with that story girl.
Hey, I was there, okay.
You're sure you weren't doing any
steering or anything like that?
Yeah, I like to drive
off cliffs.
- My robot couldn't drive.
- Are you calling me a liar?
No, but maybe you
have amnesia.
Newton! We are wasting
valueless time.
So what are these guys
used for, anyway?
- It's top-secret crap.
- That's what I figured.
Dr. Love, I'd like to get
my robot back.
He knows that,
but he's scared.
It's a machine.
It doesn't get scared.
It doesn't get happy.
It doesn't get sad.
- It just runs programs.
- How do you explain that?
You see?
He's scared that if you take him
apart he's going to die.
- Where'd you hear that?
- Number Five told me.
He'd tell you if you'd
just talk to him.
That's what I've been
trying to do for...
No, I mean with your mouth.
Watch.
Okay, Ben,
this is the plan.
Number Five!
Number Five!
Come on out. It's okay.
- Is it cool?
- It's okay.
These guys aren't going
to hurt you. They're friends.
- No disassemble?
- No, no.
They just want
to talk to you.
Come forward.
You remember forward?
- Forward.
- That's it, come on.
I can't believe it.
It's listening to her, not to us.
I am standing here
besides myself.
Okay!
Now you just tell them
what you told me.
Number Five
not just robot.
There it is!
Move! Move!
Move out!
Go! Go! Go!
Today, gentleman, today!
- Down, girlie!
- What, are you nuts?
Stop! Please.
I've clearance.
I've clearance.
Bend down!
You quit doing that!
You think I'm doing this for
my own self-gratification?
Go!
No, stop!
Stephanie!
They're killing him!
Hold your fire!
Damn it, stop!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Number Five alive!
Stephanie!
Number Five,
I'm sorry.
Steph-an-ia...
You're paralyzing him.
I cut all his power. You can
load it on the truck now.
What the hell
is the matter with you...
you four-eyed idiot.
What an asshole.
I heard that.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where are you taking him?
Okay, I want you guys to...
He's not being a him.
It's only being wires and several
mechanisms and other such...
several mechanisms and other
such machine type apparatus...
for the Pete of sake.
The <i>sate of Pekaer.</i>
You have to turn
him back on.
He was talking before
like a real person.
Couldn't you see that?
Lady, all I could see was that
something mechanical...
is screwed up and
I'll fix it, okay?
Fine! You fix it,
Einstein.
I plan to.
And it's Crosby.
Newton Crosby.
- Stephanie Speck.
- Nice meeting you.
Same here.
- Ben? Ben?
- Sir! Stat!
I want you to go with Number Five
and make sure they do not...
switch off the memory.
Do you understand?
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.
Bye-bye, goofy woman.
I enjoyed repeatedly throwing
you to the ground.
No mistake.
Stat.
You can call me
if you want to.
Call you?
To let me know
if Number Five's okay.
Okay, maybe I will.
Well, don't do me
any favors, Jack.
So there we are.
We're right on top of
Mount St. Helene's...
- and we've got two flat tires.
- Two, that's bad.
Now Hazel's running around
the parking lot.
Hazel.
<i>She's waving</i>
<i>her credit card...</i>
It's life.
It's life.
Very, very funny
American name, Hazel.
Well, It's sure not one you
can hear much anymore.
I never heard it
before I met her.
All except for witchhazel,
who I think she's named after.
- I thought it was a nut.
- That's an old name.
It's an old family name.
They were from
some place in Europe...
- and there's always a Hazel in it.
- In her family.
I guess there's always some
Hazel in Europe.
She's running around trying
to buy somebody's spare tire.
She's showing people her ID's
to prove the checks are good...
like a branch of our bank
where they could check.
She was even trying to swop some
souvernirs when she was gotten.
All of which were made from
the ashes of the volcano...
Did you get a piece of ash?
Of course nobody's going to sell
her a spare tire...
after what we just told
them happened to us.
Especially the way
she was telling them.
And she was trying to convince
them I wasn't a bad driver...
which I'm not.
But, she was doing it by telling
them how thin the road is.
You know, and how curvy and
how many rocks there were...
and how big
and sharp they are.
And all the time I know
what these people are thinking.
They gotta drive down
the same road...
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?
Sir?
My goodness gracious.
It can't shoot us with
that laser, can it?
I am not knowing.
- Would it kill me if I stopped?
- Who is to say?
Would it kill me
if I don't stop?
Again I am shrugging.
I'm stopping.
Good choice.
Number Five furious,
livid, perturbed.
Hold it right there.
Colt 45.
Semi automatic.
Play doh.
What do we do now?
I don't know about you, but
I'm planning to scream and run.
Good answer.
What is it doing?
There it goes
Very good.
You earned that one.
Hi, honey!
What is for dinner?
Bingo!
<i>Practice, Easy Three,</i>
<i>to third and fourth.</i>
<i>Luckay's seventh and</i>
<i>Pacer in the rear.</i>

<i>Jimmy's Folly is calling...</i>
<i>Serving the devil</i>
<i>and on him.</i>
<i>And the devil...</i>
Ready, aim!
What happened?
I hope you took the grass
out of the glove compartment.
Anything wrong, officer?
There's gotta be a logical
explanation for all of this.
Maybe, if it was programmed
to think it was alive...
then it could act alive.
Maybe you've created another
Frankfurter's monster.
Do I look like the kind of a man
who can actually hear...
Howard I think that something
incredible is going on.
What's going on is that we've
got a red alert on your hands?
No, it's not dangerous.
We just have to find
Number Five, get some answers.
There's only one answer.
All right, blast it off the
face of the earth, right?
How many kids you got?
None.
Well, let me tell you
something, Doctor.
I got three of them.
Three little Schroeders.
And I want them to be adults,
not barbequed.
So don't you give me
any of your bullshit.
That having been said, I think
I've got to alert the media.
Now Schroeder's going to handle
this from now on...
and you stay
at your terminal.
Howard, this is ridiculous.
Think of it as
a full-scale field test.
Leave your terminal and
you're out of a job.
Howard, we are going to have
to put up some roadblocks...
and I'm going to
need some Hueys.
Some what?
Helicopters, Howard.
Jesus Christ!
- I thought they were choppers.
- Now they're called Hueys.
Well, why wasn't I notified?
Okay, now listen to me...
- Stephanie Speck.
- Yes.
We're from KJMB News.
Can you please tell us something
About the Nova robot?
- Were you scared?
- No, no.
<i>Did he try to molest</i>
<i>you in any way?</i>
<i>No, he's not that kaind</i>
<i>of a robot.</i>
<i>Do you kanow that there's a</i>
<i>US$25 thousand reward?</i>
<i>No, I don't kanow anything</i>
<i>about it.</i>
<i>I don't kanow where it is.</i>
<i>Please, leave me alone.</i>
<i>Why didn't you go</i>
<i>to the police?</i>
You know where it is.
For US$25 thousand
I'm going to know where it is.
Frank?
Is that you, Frank?
I'm warning you,
I'm armed and dangerous.
Disguise, camouflage.
Hi!
Number Five!
You got away?
Yep.
You can't stay here!
They'll find you!
Stephanie.
Changed color.
Attractive,
nice software.
You sure don't talk
like a machine.
Alive, Stephanie.
Number Five alive.
Yes, I know you think
you're alive...
but those guys who built
you say no way.
I don't know what
to think anymore.
I know it's not safe
for you here.
Go on.
Get out.
Solitude, isolation.
Alone.
Number Five, come on!
Lonely bum.
Number five, please.
If I went to jail, who would
take care of my animals?
You sure wouldn't.
What are you doing?
"A can of soup.
A meal in itself."
All right, you can stay,
but just for tonight.
Excellent.
If they catch you
I don't know you.
You got it.
Okay, Ben, let's do it.
This is the very first vehicle
I've stolen in the US of A.
Me, too. It's kind of exciting,
Isn't it?
With excitement like this,
who is needing enemas?
Look Ben, we're doing
the right thing.
If they trash Number Five, we'll
never find out what happened.
Dr. Marner!
I knew you would try this.
You're not going
to make it, fellas.
There are soldiers out there
with bazooka's and choppers...
or whatever the hell
they call them now.
We've got to try anyway. You're
a scientist, you understand.
I'm a business man.
I'm not a scientist anymore.
Damn you, Howard.
20 years ago you would have
chauffeured us in this situation.
Times have changed.
That was then
and this is now.
All right, now come on.
Let's get back upstairs.
What the heck, Newton.
Let us punch the sack.
Tomorrow is the next day.
No.
No.
No. I'm going.
Howard, shoot me
if you have to.
Don't think I won't.
Come on, Howard,
you know you're bluffing.
Rama, Lord Rama.
Lord Rama,
Lord Rama, grant my wish.
All right, I'm bluffing.
Thank you. Come on, Ben,
let's get out of here.
Very good.
It doesn't matter anyway, the
doors are electronically sealed.
Don't be too sure.
Then you'll have
to drive over me.
That's the way
it's gotta be.
This is going to be
very messy.
This is how I get
the big bucks.
Yeah.
Very good.
Great.
Hey, thanks.
Okay, turn off the TV.
- It's time for bed.
- No.
No, turn off the TV.
It's time for bed.
Come on Steph, lighten up.
Let's give it a whirl.
- It's three a.m.
- It's early.
I mean, don't you ever
get enough?
Wrestling, roller derby,
Jimmy Swaggert...
The Three Stooges.
Give It a rest.
Larry, Curly, Moe.
Hey, Know what?
You're not a bad dancer.
Dancing fool.
- Big finish.
- Right.
And then I'm going to bed
and in the morning...
you have to find yourself
a new home.
This home.
Stephanie home.
Number Five home.
Number Five, you don't know
what you're saying.
Number Five know.
"More than a woman."
"More than a woman
to me."
Number Five.
"More than a woman to me."
<i>I'll croon</i>
<i>A little song</i>
<i>About the moon</i>
<i>And when I'm finished</i>
<i>With my crooning</i>
<i>On my kanees I'll fall</i>
<i>My life, my love, my all</i>
Okay, to make these
golden fluffy pancakes...
add flour, milk and eggs.
Mix thoroughly.
Still lumpy.
Marvelous.
For crisp, yet moist
potatoes...
brown on one side,
then turn over.
This will be
some good slop.
Is something burning?
Morning.
Number Five!
- Good morning.
- Sleep well?
You're making me breakfast,
aren't you?
Pancakes surprise.
Number Five,
you're so sweet.
Oh, no.
It's the revenge
of the Mutations.
Listen, why don't you turn that
stove off and I'll be right back.
Wait!
It'll get cold.
What are you
doing here, creep?
Good morning.
I saw you on TV last night
on the news.
Yeah, I'm a real
big celebrity.
You know there's
a reward out for that robot?
Twenty-five thousand dollars.
Now, I don't know
anything about it.
Why don't you get off
my property?
- Steph...
- Leave me alone.
- Where is it?
- It's not here.
- Get out or I'll call the cops.
- Stephanie, breakfast.
Pancakes, hash browns.
Twenty five thousand dollars.
Don't worry, we'll split it.
Twenty for me and five for you.
Listen, you gotta talk
computer to him.
Tell him exactly what
you're doing...
exactly where you're going, or
he's not going to move an inch.
Number Five,
this is Frank.
How, Robot.
Me friend.
No, talk computer,
not apache.
Fresh O.J.?
Not from concentrate.
Thanks.
Listen, what do you say
we jump in my car...
we'll take a ride.
I'll take you home.
Tell him where
home is.
Home is Nova.
Nova! No!
No disassemble!
Number Five, run!
Come on, treads,
don't fail me now.
- Run, get away now!
- Get off me!
You tricked me,
you little bitch!
Does this mean I don't
get my five thousand dollars?
Forget it! Forget it!
He can go thirty miles an hour,
you big stupid jerk.
I'll show you, how
stupid I am.
Guess who's going to help me
catch it.
Where the hell is my car?
Hi.
Piece of cake.
Oh, my God!
My car!
Oh, way to go,
Number Five.
Oh, my God, no!
Number Five,
look out!
"Say Pilgrim, that like to
parted my hair."
"If you wanna play rough,
I can sure oblige you."
How can he do that?
"Frankie...
...you broke the unwritten law.
You ratted on your friends.
And when you do that, Frankie...
your enemies don't
respect you...
you got no friends no more.
You got nobody Frankie."
Pretty good.
Unbelieveable.
Look out!
How about that,
a goddamn robot?
Stephanie, get off me!
Stephanie, that's it.
No!
Not disassemble Stephanie.
No!
I'm calling Nova, and I'm
calling the cops.
And as for you, you
little pain-in-the-neck...
you better not come crawling
back to me, because it's over!
Good.
Okay, come on.
They're gonna be after you.
We gotta get out here, now.
So now I'm having no job
to speak about.
I will have to smack
the sidewalk.
I'm not going to let it happen.
You're not going to get fired...
I'm not going to get fired...
- we'll find it intact.
- Very good.
<i>That's right, Howard.</i>
- That's Scrotum?
- Schoreder.
Same thing.
<i>... her only chance is</i>
<i>a backa road into the hills.</i>
<i>We'll concentrate</i>
<i>our search there.</i>
Where the hell are we?
"New York City".
No, I don't think so.
Try the other side.
Texeco.
Great.
I'm lost. I don't know
where to go.
- Strategy.
- What about it?
Need some, quick.
What we need is somebody
to make those bozos listen.
- Not bozos.
- What?
One bozo.
Newton Crosby, PhD.
Malfunction, he's the enemy.
He can't help.
Couldn't hurt.
I know why Number Five
took a liking to her.
If it did have that capability,
witch it doesn't, but if it did.
I mean, I think she's pretty,
don't you think?
I am thinking she's a virgin.
Or at least she used to be.
<i>Hello Crosby.</i>
I think it's Howard.
<i>I kanow you're listening,</i>
<i>so picka up the mikae.</i>
This is Crosby.
How's you're back, Howard?
Just hunky-dory, thanks.
I just swore out some warrants
for your arrest.
Good golly.
<i>Because I'm a nice guy, I'm</i>
<i>going to give you a last chance.</i>
<i>I got a phone call from the loony</i>
<i>in the lunch wagon.</i>
<i>She wants to see you.</i>
<i>- Only you.</i>
- She does?
Her paints are blazing for
you Newton Crosby.
Will you grow up.
I'll be there, on one condition.
No Schroeder's.
Is it a deal?
<i>It's a deal.</i>
- Where does she want to meet?
<i>- The Blacka Lion Inn.</i>
Good luck, sir.
Hi.
He's hidden far away.
He's scared of you guys,
you know.
Do I get him or not?
First we talk inside.
My ex-boyfriend used to
bring me here.
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Fine, good to see you.
- Yeah, ex. So what?
- Nothing.
Okay, here's the deal.
Number Five is alive.
I mean, he is really alive,
like you and me, you see?
I understand. They can seem
quite life-like...
but they're still machines.
Just like your stereo...
or your vacuum cleaner.
No, I know he's a machine.
You're a machine, I'm a
machine. We're alive.
How it happens, who the hell
knows. But it has happened.
Okay.
Believe me, I'm not against the
idea that happen, but you see...
I built the machine from scratch.
And alive, alive...
it doesn't compute.
I know. It's not your everyday
event. But somehow, it's true.
As Guerrero steps to the plate.
The pitch...
and it's a long line drive
to deep left center.
Hyde is going back for it!
He's...
Robot alert!
Number Five located.
Engage in capture,
do not destroy.
Have you thought about
what you're doing?
Trying to hide something
like this?
If you want to help Number Five,
let me have it back.
It's malfunctioning.
It needs to be repaired.
Life is not a malfunction.
Number Five axis
four twenty-nine.
Stay where you are.
- Strike three.
- Number Five, stay where you are.
Number one
you're out of there.
Number Five, stay
where you are.
Oh, my gosh.
Tools.
Hammer! Axe!
Rope!
Three quarter inch
double-braid. Perfecto!
"Escaped Robot Fights for
His Life. Film at Eleven."
Target in sight.
Fire!
Capture and hold.
Elevation sixteen degrees.
Visibility five feet,
two feet, no feet.
Hey, laser lips! Your mama
was a snowblower.
That wraps you up,
you rascally robot.
Target located. Elevation
sixteen degrees. Fire!
Holy moley!
- Elevation 22 degrees.
- Dumbo!
Axis lost.
Temper, temper!
Three degrees.
Fire!
Don't fire.
Don't light a match.
Well, when you gotta go
don't squeeze the charming.
Oh, no.
Nova!
Let me tell you something.
I don't like these Nova guys
anymore than you do.
In fact, I don't care if they
ever get Number Five back...
but I want to see it.
If I show where he is,
do I have your word...
you not experiment
on him?
You will not flip
his switches?
And you will not take
him apart?
Absolutely.
You have my word.
He's out back.
I'll take you to him.
If you are ready, young lady,
you can take me, too.
- Schroeder!
- Terrific job, Crosby. Thanks.
- No, I had nothing...
- You bastard!
- I'm not...
- You liar.
Stephanie, a trap!
Nova!
Depart!
<i>Looka out!</i>
Here's your table sir.
- You little bastard!
- Paco, please. No autographs.
Come Stephanie.
We be German.
Bastard!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!
Great idea. Newton Crosby,
Ph. Dork.
- What are you doing?
- Keep driving.
- Step on it!
- Okay, hold on.
I have had it!
I have had it!
- This was a precision operation.
- Schroeder, you set me up!
Crosby, I'm telling you
right now...
this little fart of a robot is
beginning to give me red ass.
Where the hell
are those other robots?
They should have cut
Number Five to pieces by now.
- Where are you guys going?
- Who's asking?
A wise guy.
Excuse this.
And this.
<i>Cut it out!</i>
<i>Numbskaulls.</i>
Cars.
Dumb machines.
That creep.
I should have known. Every time
I think a guy's gonna be okay...
he turns out to be a real jerk.
They are all alike!
All of them!
Stephanie...
Well, the next time they mess
with us, we're gonna kick ass.
Kick ass?
Donkey, mule, burro...
One of them comes near you,
you blast them!
Just burn his butt
with your laser.
- Burn?
- Yeah!
No!
No disassemble.
Number Five, come on,
they deserve it.
Stephanie.
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I just...
I just...
I don't know what
to do anymore.
Take heart little lady.
I'll fix their wagon.
The cat is dragged in a sight
for four eyes that's for sure.
You look dreadful.
What happened?
Where is Number five?
I saw something incredible.
I saw three robots...
totally re-programmed in
ten minutes.
I saw Number Five crash
trough a wall, grab the girl...
I think he was rescuing her...
crash trough another wall
and drive away.
It was screaming
her name.
Now, wait a minute.
If you're thinking what I'm
thinking you're thinking...
then you're thinking that
female chick is some sort of...
- super hacker or something.
- Sure. She's a super hacker.
First, she cracks
the Nova access code...
then, she deciphers
for the language...
I invented, all that
sitting in the bar.
- Which was great.
- Really? What happened?
We were interfacing, operating
on the same wavelength...
My advice helped, then.
Did she stick her tongue
down your throat?
- No, no.
- Come, tell me. I want to know.
Come on, Newton.
Oh, my goodness.
I am sporting
a tremendous woodie right now.
Come on, tell me Newton.
Our hands came really
close to touching.
And she said I had really
nice eyes.
Yeah, you have brown eyes.
And Schroeder came in with
his Gestapo and ruined it all.
Those bunch of
male-type organs.
- Right.
- That's what I'm meaning.
That's the RF receiver.
It's still tuned to Number Five's
wavelength, right?
Yes, but only if it' less than
twenty feet away.
Hello, bozos.
<i>Guys, it's Howard.</i>
<i>If you don't return...</i>
Benjamin Jhabutiyah,
delete.
No, wait!
Rethink yourself.
Exit, depart, leave.
Hear my dust, Newton Crosby!
Let us break wind!
Newton Crosby,
no run, no talk.
Drive.
Today, Crosby, today!
Number Five?
Number Five,
where are you?
All right dipshit...
where's Number Five?
What did you do to him?
- You gotta control yourself.
- Hello.
Hi.
You kidnapped him?
Kidnapnapped,
shangai, hijacked.
Outstanding!
Communicate!
Need input!
I have questions,
queries, posers.
- You and me, both.
- Well, good.
You go up there, sit down,
look at the stars...
talk to each other,
get to know each other...
- man to man.
- Yes.
Beautiful stars.
Better see.
Beautiful stars.
Better see?
Oh, my God.
Are all geniuses as
stupid as you?
He means it's a beautiful
view of the stars.
I think he speaks very well
for a four day old.
Come. Come.
Input! Input!
Beautiful.
Right.
One more time,
from the top.
Who is your programmer?
Me.
You rewired
all your switches.
No wonder
you're malfunctioning.
Switches are my switches.
Life not malfunction.
Not malfunction.
I am alive.
No, you're not!
You can't be.
There's gotta be another
explanation.
Okay!
What?
Sorry,
time's up.
Wait a minute,
I'm thinking.
Could be any number
of mechanical possibilities.
Entrance of moisture
into the system.
- Heat expansion.
- Try again.
- Vibration damage.
- No way Jose.
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Okay.
Then why did you
ignore your programming?
Programming says "Destroy".
Is disassemble.
Make dead.
Number Five cannot.
Why?
Why cannot?
Is wrong. Incorrect.
Newton Crosby, PhD,
not know this?
Of course I know it's wring
to kill, but who told you?
I told me.
<i>Pattycakae, pattycakae</i>
<i>Bakaer's man</i>
<i>Bakae me a cakae</i>
<i>As fast as you can</i>
I brought you some soup.
It's getting cold.
- Thank you.
- Convinced yet?
Well, I got one.
There we go.
<i>Pattycakae, Pattycakae</i>
Number Five,
what do you make of this?
Wood pulp.
Plant, vegetable,
tomato.
Water, salt,
monosodium glutamate.
Okay.
Thank you.
Now you're talking
like a robot.
And resemble,
look like...
butterfly.
Bird.
- Maple leaf.
- Where?
Holy shit!
No shit.
Where see shit?
Now here's your oscillating
circuit. That's done right.
And here's...
Why do you do this?
You shouldn't even
be operating if this goes into...
Let me get my other one.
I got it!
I got it!
All right,
this is it!
Now, listen close.
There's a priest, a minister
and a rabbi.
They're out playing golf and
they're trying to decide...
how much to give to charity.
So the priest says, we'll
draw a circle on the ground...
...we'll throw the money way up
in the air and whatever lands...
inside the circle,
we give to charity.
The minister says "no", we'll
draw a circle on the ground...
throw the money way up in the air
and whatever lands outside...
...that's what we give to charity.
The rabbi says "no, no, no"...
we'll throw the money way
up in the air...
and whatever God wants,
He keeps.
I get it.
What's the matter?
- Is he laughing?
- Yeah.
And the joke wasn't
even that funny.
And I figured I screwed up
the punch line.
Whatever God wants
He keeps.
Well, you look kinda
shook up.
Yeah, it's really true.
Spontaneous emotional
response.
I am alive. Yes?
Yeah, you are.
Yes! Yes!
Hey!
I hope you bought enough
for everybody.
Give me one, too, Steph.
Oh, right on the sensor.
Danger!
Nova!
All right, come on,
come down.
Why?
Just tell them he's alive.
Look, it doesn't look like
they want to hear that.
What? Wait a minute.
The plan was: We convince you,
and you convince them.
Damn it, Crosby,
you lied to me again.
Deploy!
Hit it, hit it, hit it!
Deploy!
The army!
The real army!
Your target is there,
gentlemen.
Crosby...
if I were you I would
come out of there.
Stat.
Jesus, these guys
are really severe!
Weapons. M-16 machine guns.
- 40mm grenade launchers.
- Let me handle it.
Hi, Howard.
Schroeder.
How you doin'?
We're fine. Number Five
is right here with us.
I've got it completely
under my control.
- Another lie.
- I'm lying to them, not to you.
It's still lying.
We're coming out now.
They're cooking something up.
I can smell it.
We gotta fire them now,
Howard.
Don't you dare shoot
your stupid guns.
- Where's Number Five?
- He's fine. He's in the van.
Okay. Okay.
Why don't you and the young
lady just get away from the van...
and let us handle it?
Yes, Stephanie, get away.
Danger.
Now listen...
I was able to activate
the voice command module.
God damn it!
I'm sick and tired of listening
to this technical bullshit.
Shut up, Schroeder, I'll
handle this.
He's stalling.
Crosby, we're going to have to
ask you to surrender the robot.
No!
- Stat?
- Stat!
- What does that mean anyway?
- I don't know.
But that is not the point.
We need that robot.
Howard, listen...
I know what
the malfunction is.
Sorry, Crosby...
we can't take
any more chances.
We're not losing
that thing again.
Howard, if you'd just come over
and inspect the unit...
You're all such
a bunch of liars!
As soon as they're clear,
open fire!
- Schroeder!
- I'll take care of this.
No, you're not taking over.
Now listen...
Bonzi!
<i>Don't shoot!</i>
<i>Don't shoot!</i>
He's alive!
He's alive!
Call them off, Howard.
You're making the biggest
mistake in history!
He's alive!
I can prove it.
No, look, it's okay.
He's going to make it!
No!
Number Five!
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Now that, is how
you kick ass!
Years of research are lost and
you're happy as a pig in slop.
Just doing my job, sir.
Maybe from now on you can
do it somewhere else.
Are you going
to be okay?
I don't think so.
Not for a while.
I'm sorry you lost your job.
But I'm really glad
you quit Nova.
- What will you do now?
- I don't know yet.
My dad left me a few
acres up in Montana.
I hear it's beautiful there
this time of year.
Great idea!
I say we cruise on up there
and check it out.
Hi, honey!
I'm home!
Number Five?
Pull over, pull over,
quick, pull over!
- Number Five!
- Stephanie!
It's so good to see you.
I thought they blew you up.
Counterfeit. Fac-simile.
Replica!
He made a duplicate of himself
from all these spare parts.
That's incredible!
This guy's a genius!
- Above average.
- You are great!
You're outstandingly great!
What's our next move?
Come on, let's do as he says.
Let's go to Montana.
I got forty acres up there.
Great for him to hide out...
Soak up input.
I don't know. I have
responsibilities here.
- What about my animals?
- Come on, Stephanie.
Wait a minute.
You say forty acres?
Listen, do you like animals?
Yeah. How many animals
are we talking about?
Great. I drive, you two
work this out.
Number five stupid name.
- Want to be Kevin or Dave.
- Just watch the road, okay?
Maybe Johnny.
Yeah.
Johnny Five.
That's cool.
Gimme five.
