The Lyons are hitting back on Empire.
- May we rise.
- Like we always do.
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

our other Fox programs...
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.
That's a win-win.

- Previously on Empire...
- Lucious Lyon is my father.
Leah, it's time
for you to take a break.
Are you going to sit there
and let them lock me up?
MTA Bank of Panama.
Money disappears from Empire,
and ends up
in your Panama account.
You a regular here, Mr. Lyon?
- And you are?
- Damon Cross.
- I'm married.
- I hope he knows
how lucky he is.
I'm a Lyon, and I'm done
apologizing for that.
Empire was built
on people's pain.
Our future is now.

I... I didn't know that.
"It's not my fault"
and "I didn't know"
is two different things,
Lucious.
Are you really judging me
right now?
I thought no matter what,
we had each other's back.
That's what I want, Lucious.
Hello? That's what I want.
But we got to start doing things
a lot different around here,
'cause...
Different? What the hell are you
talking about, different?
Everybody
that ever gained anything
gained at somebody else's pain.
Well, where did you get
that little nugget from, huh?
Your evil son?
He looks just like you.
How dare you say
something like that to me?
- Why?
'Cause it's the truth, huh?
- Truth?
- It hurts? You don't...
- No, you want the truth?
The truth is that you and I have
busted our ass for this family.

He'll be back, Mal.
No.
He's already back in London,
back to work.
- Covering some war. Hey, Mom.
- Hey, baby.
I'm so sorry.
You-you know, you can...
you can go after Kai
if you want to.
I'll totally understand.
Ma, I made a...
a promise to be here
for the family, so I'm good.
I just... I need to get back
to work, you know?
Okay, good, 'cause I need you
more now than ever.
I am trying to convince
your daddy
that we have to start
doing things different.
Course we have to.
- Yes.
- Ma, I didn't give up my man
and-and God knows
all that you gave up
just so that Empire
can eat us up alive again.
No, we got to be better.
Do we even know
what "better" looks like, Jamal?
I don't know.
But I'll you this.
- We gonna figure it out.
- That's right.
Because I can't go back
to knocking people down
just to build us up.
Like you said,
we are better than that.
We're Lyons.
A little something
for your first day back at work.
What is this?
Quincy helped me pick it out.
Teri, I don't want you to spend
this much money.
I'm just trying to say
thank you.
Wow.
Wow.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
You know, I'm, uh, kind of
excited to get back to Empire.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yes.
First time in a...
in a very long time
my whole family's
on the same page.
You know, ready to do whatever
we have to do to succeed.
Sounds like you're going to war.
In a way, we are.
Thank you for this, love.
Dr. Miller.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
No, I... I got it.
Yeah. Thank you, Doc.
Test results?
- What-What'd he say?
- It's nothing.
A bloody nose from a
burst blood vessel.
Oh, but he also said
to, uh, tell Nurse Teri...
What?
Stop worrying.
- Can you do that?
- I'll try.
When finished,
lay pamphlets upside down
on the table.
Do we have to listen
to all of this?
I mean, the focus group is
telling us what we already know.
Okay, I don't know, man.
Let's just...
let's just be quiet.
I want to hear.
It's just not the same.
Not as good as it was, man.
Plus, they've been
snitching on us.
No Empire track
is worth all that.
Especially not
with that generic music
they've been dropping.
- Where's Lucious Lyon?
- You know where he is.
Out making babies
behind his wife's back.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Ooh, it's Lucious Lyon.
Yeah, it's me.
And I heard everything
y'all said.
I love you, Lucious.
- I love you, too.
- I am so sorry.
- Bet you are.
- Man, you know
I was just playing.
And that didn't sound
like y'all loved us back there.
But I understand.
I mean, Empire
has lost its way.
Done more than lose our way.
We've lost your trust.
So, hey, hey,
is-is Cookie back there, too?
Yeah, we want to see her.
- Yeah.
- Where's she at?
Hey, y'all.
Now, with...
without me at the helm,
Empire managed
to fail you miserably.
But y'all ain't got to worry
about none of that no more,
'cause I'm back.
We are back.
Look, I know y'all have
been hearing some nonsense.
I want you to know
it's not true.
Lucious and I are good.
And we will restore
your faith in us again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, baby, thank you
for having my back.
I don't have a choice.
This is half my company, too.
Maybe y'all don't know,
but analytics are dead.
Dead!
Dad.
We are Empire.
We're the best music label
in the whole damn world.
And anybody that's here
that don't recognize that,
you need to get the hell out
of here right now!
Okay, let me translate
for my husband's
dramatic display.
What he's saying
is that Empire's
going to be new and improved,
y'all.
Yes.
Cookie and Lucious,
Empire's founders,
are now co-CEOs,
and with me as their partner,
I will be your COO.
And I'll resume my role
as your CFO.
And Jamal is our new
Chairman of Music Development.
Thanks for staying
with the family, son.
Family first, music always.
So, we gonna crank out
some hits, y'all.
Amen. Now, as y'all know,
our music comes from our heart,
not from a hard drive.
And therefore,
my son Hakeem Lyon
is gonna make sure
that Empire stays
on the creative edge
and ahead of all trends with him
as our Creative Director.
We got you.
- We got him, right?
- Yes.
Yeah, we got him.
And my sister
from another mister,
Ms. Becky Williams,
will remain SVP of A&R.
Her instincts are undeniable.
Mmm. Definitely undeniable.
I got you.
As my lovely wife said
so eloquently,
Empire is new and improved.
So I want y'all to go out there
with your hearts,
with your love,
with your passion
and make some music,
'cause that's what we do.
Okay,
and make some money, too.
Come on.
Yes.
Come talk to me.
Okay, I don't to admit this,
but you actually
pulled this off.
- No, we pulled this off.
- That's true.
And even though the Lyons are back,
I just want to make sure
that you still have my back.
As long as you have my back.
Come on now.
No question.
- Now, let's get to work.
- Okay.
During this re-launch,
image is everything.
I want every Empire artist
everywhere that's worth
being seen.
Fashion Week.
- Bitch.
- Bitch.
- It's Fashion Week.
- Fashion week.
- Okay, I have the perfect dress.
- Yeah. Okay. But it's not
about you, though.
It's always about me,
don't do that.
What was that about?
Hey, guys.
That speech was awesome.
Everybody's really hyped up.
It's great.
Yeah, that's the point.
Do you guys have, like, a minute
or two, maybe we could talk?
A minute or two? That seems like
a mighty long time for a chick
who thought recording
in our living room was cute.
Cookie, look.
When I left LFM, it was just
a business decision.
- It was nothing personal, I promise.
- Mm-mm.
Now, what happens
when we drag your little ass
out that door by your
pretty little feet, hmm?
I'm sorry, what?
Hah! Now you see how fast
that got personal.
If you and your disloyal vocal
cords makes us some money,
guess what? You get to stay.
But if you don't make any money,
you got to kick rocks. Clear?
Yeah. Very.
So why are you still
sitting here?
Come on. Let's make some money!
Chop, chop. Hmm.
Good.
When did you become
so damn forgiving?
Didn't you say I had to
"be better"?
Just a little bit.
Oh. Give me this bat.
Nah, I get it, I get it.
All right.
Hey, Devon. You all right?
Look. I want to be a part
of New Empire.
Well, you will be, you're
managed by LFM, remember?
Listen, Jamal is definitely
gonna want to put you
in the studio with Empire
Artists, so don't worry.
Look, my label ain't having it,
man.
All right? No co-writes,
no features.
None of that. No collabs.
Not until my debut.
Well, I'll-I'll check
'on that for you, bro.
- You can try, but...
- Brother.
I'll check on that for you.
Okay?
- I got you.
- All right.
I'm thinking 18 months, minimum,
before fans believe Empire
is Empire again.
Financially, the road
is longer and bumpier.
Kingsley made bad investments
and took on considerable debt.
I've sketched out
a five-year solvency plan.
- Wait. Five years?
- The company's a financial mess,
Pop.
Yeah, well, why can't Patel
pump some money into this?
That's not gonna happen.
Well, what about the money
your ex-husband took?
Lord, I've been there. Done that.
I couldn't convince
the Panamanian bank
that the money Eddie deposited
was mine.
I mean, Empire's.
- Of course.
- Of course.
So here, my legacy is just
weighing in the balance.
I don't care how much money
it costs.
We need to fix this, ASAP.
I need some air.
Hey. I was just
on my way up to see you.
The nursing home called
about your mom.
Yeah, I ain't got time.
I'll need to set up a meeting
with Damon Cross, man.
Whoa, whoa, Damon Cross?
A meeting about what?
I did my research after that
little poker game.
He's got a nice little
cleaning business, don't he?
Look, I know who he is,
you know?
What-what's that got to do
with us?
Yeah, I also know you used
to work for him.
Now, I assume you know
how to contact him?
I did my research.
As your attorney, I'm advising
you not to meet with this guy.
- Let's just do...
- As your employer,
I'm telling you, set up
a meeting with Damon Cross.
He owes me.
I'm going to collect.
Thanks, Thirst.
Cookie, um...
What's all this?
Uh, I... I couldn't remember
whether you liked regular,
almond or soy milk
in your coffee,
so I brought you all three.
Nah, you're a little too extra.
Look. Um, uh, Cookie, um...
I was really inspired by what
you guys said today.
Look, I have a lot of ideas
for Empire, okay? And I was
hoping that we could talk about
maybe an elevated position
- like a choreographer?
- Okay. Ba-boop, boop, boop,
boop.
You've been with me for less
than a month
and you're already expecting
a promotion?
I have so much more to offer.
Oh. Very ambitious of you.
Okay. Why don't you elevate
your ass
on up to Porsha's office
and discuss all your
little ideas with her?
Oh, I don't-I don't get coffee
now, huh?
Okay. Petty.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So... You know that your niece
and nephew have been begging
to see their Uncle Mal
and Uncle Kai-Kai.
Where y'all been at?
Oh. Uh...
Uncle Kai-Kai
has... gone bye-bye.
I'm so sorry, Jamal.
I didn't know.
It's all good, you know?
Just gotta stay grinding.
Got to stay focused
on the task at hand.
But you know
about something like that.
That's actually what
I was calling you about.
Empire's gonna need straight
hits out the gate, you know?
So I've been working
on a bunch of things,
and this one situation I have,
I just need
a strong female vocal.
I'm your girl.
You haven't even heard it yet, but...
I don't have to hear it.
I trust you.
And plus, I really appreciate
you showing me love,

We met... At the Moët.
Wait, when did we go
to the Moët?
"We" didn't.
I mean, everyone knows
the amazing Cookie Lyon
and no one could forget
meeting you,
but I think you have me confused
with another brother.
No, no, no. At the elevator.
Never mind,
it'll come back to you.
All right, well, let's get down
to some business, all right?
So how can I help you?
Well, a recently departed friend
was siphoning a great deal
of money from Empire.
So now, our money is sitting in
an offshore account.
And we need someone with
a certain amount of influence
over the Panamanian banking
community to help us.
I appreciate the consideration,
but if I can accommodate you,
how soon could you be on
a plane?
You know, this is not gonna work
without an Empire boss.
Well, Lucious has interviews
back-to-back
and it wouldn't be a good look
if he just disappeared
in the middle of our rebranding,
so I'll go.
No, I don't think it's a good
look for Eddie's ex to go again.
So I... I should go.
- No, you don't need to.
- Yeah, I should.
Well, that's if Mr. Cross is up
for the challenge?
Well, I'm always up
for a challenge.
I guess we got a deal.

there must be something

Look, kid, maybe you missed the
memo while you were locked up,
but begging is still unbecoming.
Let's test that theory.
Shall we?
- What the hell are you doing?!

Samurais were clever.
They knew how to deceptively

to your artists' accounts.
You have them paying for your
little call girls and call boys.
That's ridiculous!
Not according to your ex-wife,
it's not.
You know, it's incredible
how a few dollars can jog

Welcome back, Mr. Cross.
I'll have your bags brought up

and just one moment
- for your keys.
- Thank you.
So... I set up the meeting
with Julio Calderon.
Just as a warning...
he's old school,
so he expect a woman
to know her place.
You see, I thought you were tripping
when you said
we never met, but
it's clear, because you know
Cookie doesn't play
by any man's rules.
It's cute when you do that.
- Do what?
- Pretend like you don't care.
The Moët.
I knew I wasn't crazy.
Here are your keys, Mr. Cross.
Thank you.
Yeah. I'll always be grateful
for what you did for me
- in that elevator.
- Mm-hmm.
And that's the reason
why I'm helping you.
Well, why...
why were you pretending
like you didn't recognize me?
Well, I mean,
if I admitted my truth,
you think Lucious would have
allowed you to come?
Allowed?
I don't need
my man's permission.
We are here for one thing
and one thing only,
and that's
to get Empire's money back.
LFM and Empire have merged,
so I don't understand
why we're not
expanding beyond artists.
We could be signing dancers
and models, even influencers.
- That is a great idea.
- Thank you.
For another day.
Right now, our main focus is
on new sounds and musicians,
not no dancers.
- Okay, so why take
Blake off the list?
- T.M. Easy, Girl!
That is none of your business.
I'm just saying,
he's undeniably a draw.
Listen, Blake plus Hakeem
plus Tiana...
that is a bomb
I'm not trying to detonate.
Sorry, I... I... I didn't know.
Look, I get it, okay?
I was you once,
with much better style.
Hmm, 'cause that sweater
- got to go.
- Okay.
It take a minute
to pay your dues, okay?
You just got to know your place
and stop overstepping.
It's funny that you have that
logic of knowing your place,
'cause that hasn't really
helped you around here.

letting me rot in this rathole.
You know
I don't deserve to be here.
Look, Ma,
you need the kind of help
that I can't give you right now.
You're rotten to the core.
Just like your father
and your bastard son.
How do you even know
about Jeffrey?
Your demon spawn came to see me.
You and me finally have
something in common...
knowing what it feels like
to wish your child
never breathed its first breath.
What did little chocolate chip
say when you told her?
How long did it take her
to march her sassy ass
out the front door?
Cookie didn't leave me.
She will.
Soon as she realizes that
no matter how much you promise
to be a good little boy...
...you'll never change.
I know my whole life I've...
spent it...
hurting people.
But it was because
I didn't get the love
that I needed from my mother.
So, if I'm a monster...
...it's because
you made me that way.
That evil...
has always been in you.
It ain't going nowhere.
Neither are you.
Look, I'm sorry about that mess
that Treasure started
on the red carpet.
Sit.
But I'm letting it go.
I got to focus on this hit that
me and Jamal are about to make.
She want to focus now.
It don't work that way,
does it, G?
It never really does,
does it, B?
- Never.
- Never.
Hey, guys.
Um... No.
What is Mama Tee doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Okay. Sit down.
Look, $100,000.
That's how much
it's going to cost
to find and gather
all the photos of you two
wannabe divas
ready to throw blows.
Do you think Empire has the time
for this right now?
'Cause we don't.
We really don't.
Okay? And Jamal has a very
specific vision
for Empire's music.
And y'all better thank
y'all lucky stars
that he still wants you
to be involved, okay?
Which is why he is willing
to work with both of you.
Both of who? I'm-I'm not
- working with her.
- Oh, you don't have to.
Jamal,
what the hell is going on?
It looks like you're
being replaced, Mama.
First of all, sweetie, you can
- never replace me. Top shop.
- 'Cause that's what's happening.
- Vintage Dior. Top shop.
- Look... Wow.
Wow!
Now, y'all done?
'Cause I hope you know you ain't
the only ones
going through stuff.
But guess what?
Seems like I'm here.
Seems like I'm acting
like a professional,
and I'm ready
to get the job done.
So if you and you, Tiana,
are not willing to do the same,
y'all can
dance your happy asses
up outside the studio.
Hmm? Okay.
Now,
I am taking my vocal off of
the song, and you two are gonna
- record it together.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Tee, listen to me.
- Jamal, no.
- That's not gonna work here.
- Listen. Listen. Excuse me.
Tee, you've never done a song
with a strong female.
- Thank you.
- And, Treasure,
you've barely ever done a song,
so you could definitely use
the cosign
from Empire's princess.
Huh. You're welcome.
Look,
any more issues,
and neither one of you
are gonna be working with Jamal.
You got it?
Are we clear?
'Cause you better get clear.
Quickly.
We're clear.
Now, get y'all mean asses
out of here.
Yo, Dre.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Of course.
Tell me you heard.
They let me out
of my contract, man.
Yes. I know we didn't ask
for that, but...
I'm here, man.
I'm a free man.
Yeah. Sometimes people do
the right thing
out of the goodness
of their hearts, huh?
My guy.
- My man.
- Appreciate it, man.
- Welcome to Empire.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- Let's get it.
She's here. She's here.
Oh, my God,
you look so beautiful.
It's unbelievable.
Look how you look.
Oh, I hope I didn't keep
you gentlemen waiting too long.
A star has fallen
from the heavens.
Handsome and charming.
- Thank you.
- Of course, of course.
A round of Seco.
Allergic to anything, Cookie?
Fake Chanel.
Why do people do that?
I'm sorry, I don't speak
your beautiful language,
but, uh, it appears
that negotiations with you two
are going south.
Beautiful and astute.
Well, may I sweeten the deal...
with something
that only I can offer?
- By all means.
- I'm sure your clients
would enjoy a private concert
with my Empire artists.
Gratis, of course.
The Saudis paid millions
for the privilege.
This is true, but...
No buts, Julio.
That bastard Eddie Barker
embezzled Empire money,
money I need to save my company.
Look, I'm willing
to give you ten percent
of what's in the account.
25% of what's in the account.
You are insulting
the lady, Julio.
- Let's go.
- No.
I'm not going anywhere
without my money.
So, unless you plan on room-
and-boarding me, Mr. Calderon...
Or lose a significant portion
of your clientele.
You would end our lucrative
relationship over this woman?
That's Cookie Lyon.
She's worth it.
- Salud.
- Salud.
And then when you switch to 16,
you know, just go crazy.
I want you to do your thing.
Yeah.

I took the credit for it.
Oh, so not only did you
steal my idea,
but you're acting like
it was yours.
So much for me
knowing my place, right?
I mean, stick to your grind.
Eventually, you'll get yours.
You don't want to stay

No, I think I'll come up with
some more ideas

Okay.
Dope. We gonna run it back

So, what do we owe

Hold on, hold on, hold on,

- We're celebrating.
- Celebrate?
Oh, no, no, no, no, these feet
aren't celebrating anything.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
We did that.
- Okay, we did do that.
- Let's go.
- All right.
- I'll show you how to dance.
Watch out, now.
You can't see me.
I see you all day.
You can't see me.
I'm seeing you.
Gonna do one spin, one spin,
one spin this way.
Come back to me.
See? I got you.
Got you.
I should go.
But we're just getting started.
Do I need to remind you
that I'm married?
I'm well aware of that.
But do you want to be?
What kind of question is that?
It's a simple question,
an honest question.
I ain't never lied to my woman,
I never will.
Is that so, mister?
I don't believe we've ever met.
Yeah, but you ain't
my woman yet.
Yet?
You're delusional.
I will have my office
send you a check
for all of your troubles.
Have a great life, Damon.
I don't plan on chasing you.

that I spoke the truth,
trust me, you're gonna
come back to me.

Dr. Miller?
It's kind of late.
Hey, Dr. Miller.
Uh... no worries.
Tomorrow morning?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
What was that?
He wants to see me
in the morning.
Something about missing lab
results that just came in.
What you want?
Right on, brother.
Let me get the Thirsty Special.
You know, two orders
of the Ackee Salt Fish,
two Jamaican beef patties
with the coco bread,
- and a ginger beer.
- Coming right up.
All right, it's gonna be
a Netflix and chill...
- FBI.
- Damn it.
Your boys could have waited
till I got my food at least.
Common courtesy.
Mr. Rawlings, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Conway.
It's a real pleasure.
Well, you must not get out much
if you think this is a pleasure.
Let's talk about Damon Cross.
Damon who?
Well, now you're
boring me, Thurston.
I was told you were clever.
That's the best you can
come up with, "Damon who"?
It's disappointing.
Well, says no girl
I've ever been with.
Okay, look, you're
wasting your time, Miss.
You can call me Meghan.
Now, you're either gonna tell me
what I want to know
about Damon Cross,
or we're gonna talk about
your other buddy, Lucious Lyon.
Remember him?
Meghan, you know what
I do remember?
Something called attorney-client
privilege.
That's what I remember.
I thought they would have
taught you the exception
to that rule at
University of Guam Law.
Here's the billion-dollar
question.
Lucious Lyon or Damon Cross:
whose freedom are you gonna
trade for your own?
Lucious, what are you
doing here?
I just wanted to make sure
you was all right, baby.
I'm fine, I'm fine, okay?
We're fine.
We got the money, it's gonna be
wired into our account tomorrow.
Great. Then let's turn
this little visit
- into a celebration.
- No, no, no, no.
What about your interviews?
Look, I want to
show you something, okay?
Is that the crack house
on 29th and Ontario?
Yes, it is.
Guess who owns it now.
We do.
Oh, come...
What the hell do you need
with a crack house, Lucious?
Not like it's gonna
break the bank or nothing.
Look, my plan is to turn it into
a little rehab center.
You know, for teens
and for young boys who...
whose mothers don't know
how to teach 'em
how to be good people.
What's wrong, Lucious?
I'm sorry.
For what?
The other day,
when you were all over me,
you know, about change.
I got defensive.
I took it like you was attacking
everything we built together.
I didn't mean it like that.
I know, I know, I know.
When you say you want
to make right
the things we did wrong,
I think that's the way
for us to rebuild
and retell our story together.
