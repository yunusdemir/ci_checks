<i>The Prancing Pony</i>
I'm dying of thirst over here.
C'mon, come on!
Here you are.
- Watch it!
- Sorry, darling.
- Here you are.
- Ah, thank you.
Mind if I join you.
I'll have the same.
I should introduce myself,
My name is Gandalf.
- Gandalf 'The Grey'.
- I know who you are.
Well, now! This
is a fine chance.
What brings, Thorin
Oakenshield to Bree?
I received word, that my father has been
seen wandering the wilds near Dunlin.
I went looking, found
no sign of him.
Thorin, It has been a long time since,
anything but rumor was heard of Thr√°in.
He still lives, I am sure of it.
My father came to see you,
before he went missing.
What did you say to him?
I urged him to
march upon Erebor.
To gather the seven
armies of the dwarves.
To destroy the dragon and take
back, the lonely mountain.
And I would say the same to you,
take back your homeland.
This is no chance meeting,
is it..Gandalf?
No.
It is not.
The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.
That dragon has sat there, long enough.
Sooner of later, darker minds
will turn towards Erebor.
I ran into some unsavoury characters,
whilst travelling among the Greenland.
They mistook me, for a vegabond.
- I imagine they regreted that.
One of them was
carrying a message.
It is 'Black Speech'.
A promise of payment.
- For what?
Your head.
Someone wants you dead.
Thorin, you could wait no longer. You
are the heir to The Throne of Durin.
Unite the armies of the dwarves.
Together, you have the might & power..
To retake Erebor.
Summon the meeting of the 7 dwarf families.
Demand, they stand by their oaths.
The Seven armies swore an oath to the
one who wields the King's jewel..
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>
It is the only thing,
that would unite them.
And in case you've forgotten,
that jewel was stolen by Smaug.
What if, I were to
help you reclaim it?
How?
<i>The Arkenstone</i> lies
half a world away.
- Buried, beneath the feet
of a fire breathing dragon.
- Yes, it's danger.
Which is why, we are
going to need a burglar.
- How close is the pack?
- Too close.
- A couple of leads, no more.
Saw them, towards the west.
Did the Orcs picked up our scent?
- Not yet, but they will do.
We have another problem.
They saw you?
- No, that's not it.
Good, what did I tell you?
Quite as a mouse.
- Excellent burglar material!
- Will you listen.
Will you just LISTEN?
I'm trying to tell you, there
is something else out there.
What form did it take..
like a bear?
Ye.. yes, yes. But,
bigger, much bigger!
You knew about this beast?
- I say, we double back.
- And be run down by a pack of Orcs?
There is a house.
Not far from here. Where
we might, take refuge.
Whose house..a friend or a foe?
Neither 'en.
He will help us..
or He will kill us.
What choice do we have?
None.
This way, quickly!
Run!
In the house.
Run!
Come on, get inside!
Open the door!
Quickly!
Push!
Come on, lads!
What is that?
That is our host.
His name is Beorn.
And, he is a skin-changer.
Sometimes, he's a
huge black bear.
Sometimes, he is a
great strong man.
The bear is unpredictable. But,
the man can be reasoned with.
However, he's not
over fond of Dwarves.
He is leaving.
Come away from there!
It's not natural. None of it.
It's obvious, he's
under some dark spell.
Don't be a fool.
He is under no
enchantment, but his own.
Alright, now!
Get some sleep, all of you.
You will be safe here, tonight.
I hope.
So, you are the one
they call Oakenshield?
Tell me,
Why is Azog 'the defiler'
hunting you?
You know of Azog, how?
My people were the first,
to live in the mountains.
Before the Orcs, came
down from the north.
The defiler killed
most of my family.
But some, he enslaved.
Not for work, you understand?
But for the sport.
Caging skin changers and torturing
them, seemed to amuse him.
There are others like you?
Once, there were many.
And, now?
Now, there's only one.
You need to reach the mountain,
before the last days of Ortum.
Before Durian day falls, yes.
You are running out of time.
Which is why, we must
go through Mirkwood.
A darkness lies
upon that forest.
Fell things greed
beneath those trees.
There is an alliance between the Orcs of
Moria, & the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.
I will not venture there.
Except, in great need.
We will take the Elven road.
Their prophet's still safe.
Safe?
The wood Elves of Mirkwood
are not like their kins.
They are less wise
and more dangerous.
But, it matters not.
What do you mean?
This lands are
crawling with orcs.
Their numbers are growing.
And, you are on foot. You will
never reach the forest alive.
I don't like Dwarves.
They are greedy..
..and blind.
Blind to deny of those they
deem lesser than their own.
But Orcs, I hate more.
What do you need?
Go now, while you
have the light.
Your hunters are not far behind.
The Elven Gate.
Here lies our path
through Mirkwood.
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.
Set the ponies loose, let
them return to their Master.
This forest.. feels sick.
As if a disease lies upon it.
Is there no way around?
Unless we go 200 miles north
or twice that distance..
South.
<i>Something moves in
the shadows, unseen.</i>
<i>Hidden from outside.</i>
<i>Everyday, it grows in strength.</i>
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>
<i>He's not what he seems.</i>
<i>If our enemy has
returned, we must know.</i>
<i>Go to the tombs
in the mountains.</i>
The high fells.
So be it.
Not my horse, I need it.
You're not leaving us?
I would not do this,
unless I have to.
You've changed, Bilbo Baggins.
You're not the same hobbit
that once left the Shire.
I was going to tell you..
I found something, in
the Goblin tunnels.
Found what?
What did you find?
My courage.
Good. That's good.
You will need it.
I will be waiting for you at the Everlong.
Before the slopes of Erabor.
Heed the map and keep it safe!
Do not enter that
mountain without me.
This is not the Greenwood, alone.
The very air of the forest
is heavy, With illusion.
It will seek to
enter your mind..
And lead you astray.
- Lead us astray?
What does that mean?
You must stary on the path!
Do not leave it. If you do..
You'll never find it again.
No matter what may come,
stay on the path!
Come on! We must reach the mountain,
before the sun sets on Durin's day.
It's our one chance, to
find the hidden door.
The path turns this way.
This way.
Air..
I need air.
My head..it's spinning!
What's happening? - No moving.
Dori, why have we stop?
The path, it's disappeared!
What's going on?
- We've lost the path!
Find it!
Go on, you look.
Look for the path!
I don't remember,
this place is a mess.
None of it is familiar.
<i>It's got to be here.</i>
Look, a tobacco pouch.
There's Dwarves in this woods!
Dwarves in the Blue
Mountain, no less.
This has exactly the seams, as mine!
- Because, it is yours.
Do you understand? We're going
around in circles, we are lost.
We are not lost. We
keep heading east.
But, which way is the east?
We've lost the sun!
<i>The sun.</i>
<i>We have to find.. the suns.</i>
<i>Up there.</i>
Enough! Quite! All of you.
We are being watched.
I can..see a lake!
And the..river.
And the Lonely Mountain.
We are almost there!
Can you hear me?
I know which way to go!
Hello?!
Hello.
<i>Now, none is running.
Their hide is tough.</i>
<i>This could be smushy inside.</i>
<i>Finish it off. Who
needs it alive.</i>
<i>Who needs it alive.. Let us kill him.
Kill him..kill him, now!</i>
<i>Let us feast..feast..feast.</i>
<i>Feast..feast!</i>
<i>Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it?!</i>
Here!
<i>It stings..STINGS!</i>
Sting.
That's a good name.
Sting.
Where is it?
Come on! Where is it?
We are clear!
Do not think, I won't
kill you Dwarf.
It would be my pleasure.
Kili!
Throw me a dagger!
Quick!
You think, I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf?
You are mistaken.
Search them!
Hey, give it back!
That's private!
Who's this?
Your brother? - That is my wife!
And, what is this? A horrid creature.
A Goblin Mutant?
- That's my wee lad, Gimly!
Where did you this?
- It was given to me.
Not just a thief..
But, a liar as well.
Thorin, Where is Bilbo?
Aren't you going to search me?
I could have anything
down my trousers?
- Or, nothing.
Arhhg..again! - Leave it!
There is no way out!
This is no Orc dungeon. These are
the Halls of the Woodland realm.
No one leaves here. But,
by the King's consent.
Some may imagine that,
a noble quest is at hand.
A Quest, to reclaim a
Homeland and slay a dragon.
I myself, suspect a
more prosaic motive.
Attempted burglary..
or something of that ilk.
You have found a way in?
You seek that which would bestow
upon you, the right to rule.
A King's Jewel.
The Arkenstone.
It is precious to
you, beyond measure.
I understand that.
There are gems in the
mountain that I do desire.
White gems, a pure starlight.
I offer you, my help.
- I am listening.
I will let you go.
If you but, return what is mine.
- A favour, for a favour.
You have my word.
One King to another.
I would not trust, Thranduil.
The great king, to only his word.
Till the end of all days be upon us.
You!
Lack on honour!
I've seen how you treat your friends.
We came to you once..
Homeless; seeking your help.
But, you turned your back!
You, turned away from the
suffering of my people.
The infernal that destroyed us!
Do not talk to me of dragonfire?
I know it's wrath and ruin.
I have faced.. The great
serpents of the North.
I warned your grandfather, of
what his greed would summon.
But, he would not listen.
You are just like him.
Stay here, if you will and rot.
A hundred years is a mere
blink in a life of an Elf.
I am patient.
I can wait.
Did he offer you a deal?
- He did.
Yes, I told him he could go
<i> Iskh khakfre Anduruk Nu</i> ll.
Him and all his kin!
Well, that's that then.
The deal.. was our only hope.
It's not our only hope.
I know you are there.
Why do you linger,
in the shadows?
I was coming to report to you.
I thought, I ordered that nest to
be destroyed not two moons past.
We cleared the forest, as ordered, my
Lord. But more spiders keep coming up
from the south.
They're spawning in the ruins
of Dol Guldur. If we could kill
them at their source..
That fortress lies
beyond our borders;
Keep our lands, clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.
And when we drive
them off, what then?
Will they not spread
to other lands?
- Other lands are
not my concern.
Fortunes of the world,
will rise and fall.
But here in this
kingdom, we will endure.
Legolas said, you
fought well today.
He's grown very fond of you.
I assure my Lord,
Legolas thinks of me as not more
than a captain of the guard.
Perhaps, he did..once.
Now, I'm not so sure.
I..do not think, that you would allow your
son, to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.
No, you are right. I would not.
Still, he cares about you.
Do not give him hope,
where there is none.
The stone in your
hand, What is it?
It is a Talisman.
A powerful has upon it. If any but a
dwarf reads the rune on the stone,
It will be forever cursed.
Or not.
Depending on whether you believe in
the kind of thing. It's just a token.
The Rune Stone.
My mother gave me it to me.
So, I'd remember my promise.
What promise?
That, I would come back to her.
She worries.
She thinks I'm reckless.
Are you?
Nah.
Sounds like, Quite..a party,
you're having up there.
It is Marid An Gili.
The Feast of Starlight.
All light is sacred
to the Eldar.
But, The Wood-elves loves
best, the light of the stars.
I always thought,
it is a cold light.
Remote and far away.
It is 'memory'.
Precious and pure.
Like, your promise.
I have walked there sometimes.
Beyond the forest,
up into the night.
I've seen the world full away.
And the white light,
forever filled the air.
I saw Fineawen once.
The roads of past near Dominan, huge,
red and golden it was, filled the sky.
We were an escort with some merchants.
In marid levin..they were..
trading in silver work for furs.
We took the greenway of south.
Keeping the mountain
to our left.
But then, it appeared.
This huge Fineawen
lights in our path.
I wish I could show you..
There are guards, nearby!
What's that? You, first.
Not that way. Down here..follow me!
This way.
Come.
- I don't believe, we're in the cellars.
You're supposed to be leading
us, unknown..further away.
I know what I'm doing. - Shhh.
Now, come on. Climb, into
the barrels..quickly!
Are you mad? They will find us.
No, no. They won't!
I promise you.
Please, please..
you must trust me.
Do as he says.
What do we do now?
Hold your breath.
- Hold my breath..What do you mean?
Where is the keeper of the keys?
Well done, Master Baggins.
Go, come on let's go!
This is left alive
Oh, it's you.
Why am I here, Gandalf?
Trust me, Radagast. I would not
accord you here, without good reason.
This is not, a nice place to meet.
- No.
It is not.
These are dark spells, Gandalf.
Old..and full of hate.
Who's buried here?
If he had a name, It's
long since been lost.
He would've been known only,
'As a servant of Evil'.
One of the number.
One of nine.
Why now, Gandalf?
I don't understand!
- The Rig raids had been
summoned to Dol Guldur.
But, it cannot be
the Necromancer.
A human sorcerer, could
not summon such evil.
Who said it was human.
And, Nine only answers
to One Master.
We've been blind, Radagast.
And, in our blindness..
The enemy has returned.
He is summoning his servants.
Azog-The Defiler, is
no ordinary hunter.
He is a commander. The
commander of legions.
The enemy..is preparing for war.
Which will begin, in the east. His
mind is set upon that mountain.
Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.
Gandalf?!
- I started this. I
cannot forsake them.
They're in a grave danger.
If what you say is true.
The world is in grave danger.
The power in that fortress,
will only grow stronger.
You want me to cast
my feelings aside.
Anything behind us?
Not that I can see.
I think we've outrun the Orcs.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.
Make for the shore!
Come on! Let's go.
I'm fine, it's nothing.
On your feet.
- Gili is wounded. His leg needs binding.
There's Orc pack on us here.
We keep moving.
To where?
- To the mountain. We are so close.
A lake lies between
us and that mountain.
We have no way to cross it.
- So then, we go arround.
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.
We have no weapons
to defend ourselves.
Bind his leg, quickly.
We have two minutes.
Do it again and you are dead.
Excuse me, but uh..
You're from Lake-town?
If I'm not mistaken.
That barge over there.
I would be available for
hire, by any chance.
What makes you think,
I would help you?
Those boots have
seen better days.
As has that coat.
I've no doubts you have
some hungry mouths to feed.
How many bearings?
A boy and two girls.
And your wife, I imagine;
She's just a beauty.
Aye.
She was.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..
- Oh, come on! C'mon, enough
with the niceties.
What's your hurry?
- What's it to you?
I would like to
know, who you are.
And, what you are
doing in these lands.
We are simple merchants,
from the blue mountains.
Journeying to see our
kin, in the island hills.
Simple merchants, you say?
We need food, supplies, weapons.
Can you help us?
I know where these
barrels came from.
What of it?
- Do not know what business you had,
with the Elves.
But, I don't think
it ended well.
No one enters Lake-town, but
by leave of the master.
All his wealth, comes from trade
with the wickerland realm.
He would see you in irons, before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.
Offer him more.
I'll wager there are ways
to enter that town, unseen.
Aye.
But for that..
You would need a smuggler.
- For which, we would pay..
Double.
Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in the vast ignorance
of the world. It festers & spreads,
a shadow that grows in the dark.
Sleepless malice as black as
the oncoming wall of night.
So it ever was.. so
will it always be.
In time, all foul
things come forth.
You were tracking a company
of thirteen dwarves, why?
- Not thirteen, not anymore.
The young one, the
black head archer.
We stuck him with
a mortal shaft.
The poisons in his blood,
He'll be choking on it soon.
Answer the question, filth!
I would not antagonize her.
You like killing things, Orc?
You like death?
Then, let me give it to yo..
- Halt!
I do not care about one dead dwarf.
Answer the question.
You have nothing to fear.
Tell us what you know and
I will set you free.
You had orders to
kill them, why?
What is Thorin
Oakenshield, to you?
The dwarf runt, will never be king.
- King?!
There is no king under the
mountain, or there will ever be.
None, would dare enter Erebor.
Whilst the dragon lives.
- You know nothing.
Your world will burn.
What are you talking about?
Speak!
Our time has come again.
My master, serves..The One.
Do you understand now, Elven?
Death is upon you.
The flames of war are upon you!
Why you do that? You
promised to set him free.
And, I did.
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.
There was more the
Orc could tell us.
There was nothing more,
he could tell me.
What he mean, by
The flames of war?
It means they intend to unleash a weapon
so great, it will destroy all before it.
I want watch doubled at our
borders; all roads, all rivers.
Nothing moves, without
a hear on it.
No one enters this kingdom..
And no one leaves it.
Watch out!
What are you trying to do, drown us?
- I was born & bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.
If I wanted to drown you,
I would not do it here.
Oh, I've had enough of
this snippy lake man.
I say, we throw him
off of the side..
And be done with him.
- No, Bard..his name is Bard.
How do you know?
Ah, I asked him.
- I don't care what he calls himself;
I don't like him.
We do not have to like him.
We simply, have to pay him.
Come on now, lads.
Turn out your pockets.
How do we know, he won't betray us?
- We don't.
There's seven. A wee problem.
We are ten coins short.
Gloin.
Come on, give us what you have.
Don't look to me.
I have been bled dry,
by this venture.
What have I seen,
for my investment?
'Nought, misery.. grief.
Bless, my beard.
Take it.
Take all of it.
The money, quick! Give it to me.
We will pay you, when we have
our provisions. But, not before.
If you value your freedom,
you will do as I say.
There are guards ahead.
What is he doing?
He is talking to someone.
He is..pointing right at us.
Now they're shaking hands.
- What?
For villain. He's
selling us out.
Oh, good God!
Quite!
We are approaching
the toll gate.
Halt, goods Inspection!
Papers, please!
Oh, it's you Bard!
- Morning, Percy.
Anything to declare? - Nothing.
That I am cold and tired.
I'm ready for home.
You and me, both.
There we are, all in order.
Not.. so..fast.
Consignment of empty barrels,
From the woodland dwell.
Only..
They are not empty.
Are they Bard?
If I recall correctly, You're
licensed as a Bardsman.
Not..
..a fisherman.
That's none of your business.
- Wrong. It's the Master's business;
Which makes it, my business.
Oh, come on..Alfrid. Have a heart.
People need to eat!
These fish are illegal.
Empty barrels over this side.
You heard him. - In the canal.
Come on..
Times are hard. Food is scarce.
That's not my problem.
And when people hear the Master is
dumping fish back in the lake..
..when the rioting starts.
Will it be your problem, then?
Stop!
Ever the people's
champion, eh..Bard?
Protector of the common folk, You
might be the favour now Bard.
But, it won't last.
Raise the gate!
The Master has eyes on you.
You'll do well to remember.
We know, where you live.
It's a small town, Alfrid.
Everyone knows, where
everyone lives.
All this talk about,
civil arm race.
Someone's been stirring
the pot, Sire.
Gout playing ox Sire?
It's the damp. It's the
only possible explanation.
Now, get me a brandy.
The mood of the people, Sire.
It's turning ugly.
They are commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.
It's not my fault, they live in a place
that stinks of fish oil and tarp.
Jobs, shelter..food. It's
all they ever peed about.
It's my believe, Sire. They've
been let on by troublemakers.
Then, we must find these troublemakers.
And arrest them.
My thoughts exactly, Sire.
And all this talk of change.
Must be suppressed.
We can't afford to let the rebels band
together, they'll start making noises.
The next thing you know, they
will start asking questions.
Forming Committees.
Launching enquiries.
Out with the old,
In with the new.
What?
That's what I've
been saying, Sire.
There is even talk of an election.
- An election?!
That's absurd! I
wouldn't stand for it.
I don't think they'd ask
you to stand, Sire.
Circus..ingrates!
Rebel rousers..
Who would have the nerve
to question, my authority?
Who would dare..! Who?
Bard!
You mark my words. That..trouble
making Bard-man is behind all this.
Get your hands off me!
You didn't see them.
They were never here.
The fish, you can
have for nothing.
Follow me!
Da!
Our house.. It's being watched!
You can tell the Master,
I am done for the day.
Da!
Where have you been?
Father, there you are!
I was worried.
Here, too.
Bain, get them in.
If you speak of this, to anyone.
I'll rip your hands off!
Get it off.
Up there.
Da, why do the Dwarves
climbing out our toilet?
Will they bring us luck?
They may not be the best fit.
But, they will keep you warm.
Oh, it's fine. Thank you.
Very good.
The Dwarvish Windlass.
You look like,
you've seen a ghost.
He has.
The last time we
saw, such a weapon.
The city was on fire.
It was the day, the dragon came.
The day that Smaug
destroyed Dale.
Girion, The Lord of the Vesuvia. Gathered
his bowmen, fired upon the beast.
But, a dragon's hide is tough.
Tougher than the strongest armour.
Only a black arrow, fired from Windlass;
Could have pierced the dragon's hide.
And, few of those
arrows were ever made.
The store was running low, when
Girion made his last attempt.
The Dalewood men,
been true that day.
Much would be different.
You speak as if you were there.
All Dwarves, know the tale.
And, you would know that
Girion hit the dragon.
He loosen the scale under the left wing. One
more shot & he would have killed the beast.
That's a feely story
lad, nothing more.
You took the money.
Where are the weapons?
Wait here.
Tomorrow begins the
last days of Autumn.
Durin's day falls the
morning after next.
We must reach the mountain,
before there lads.
And, if we do not?
If we fail, to find the
hidden door before that time.
Then, this quest has
been for nothing.
What is this? - Pipe hook.
Made from an old harpoon.
And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.
Expansion from smittys hammer.
It's heavy in hand,
I grand..but..
In defense of your life, these
will serve you better than none.
We paid you for weapons.
Iron forged, Swords
of dark sheath.
It's a joke!
You won't find better
outside the city armory.
All iron forged weapons are
held there, locked and key.
Thorin, why not take
what's on offer and go?
I've made do with less.
So have you.
I say, we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere!
What did you say?
- There are spies watching this house,
And probably, every dock
and holes in the tunnel.
You must wait till nightfall.
Thorin.
Da?
Don't let them leave.
Tauriel..
You cannot hunt thirty
Orcs, on your own.
But, I'm not on my own.
You knew, I would come.
The King is angry, Tauriel.
For 600 years my father has protected you.
Favoured you..
You defied his orders.
You betrayed his trust.
The King has never let
Orcs freed from our lands.
But, he would let these Orc packs cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.
It is not our fight.
It is our fight.
It will not end here.
With every victory,
this evil will grow.
If your father has his
way, We will do nothing.
We will hide withing our walls.
Live our lives away
from the light..
And let darkness decend.
Are we are not part
of this world?
Tell me, nell'Om.
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?
Hello Bard, who are you after?
There was a tapestry.
An old one.
Where is it gone?
- What tapestry are you talking about?
This one!
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared out of nowhere.
Full beards, pierced eyes.
I've never seen the like.
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?
- It's the prophecy.
What prophecy?
- Prophecy of Durin's vault.
Prophecy.
The old tales may come true.
Vast golds and treasure!
Can it mean it's true? Has the
lord of silver fountains returned?
The Lord of Silver fountains.
The king of carven stone.
The king beneath the mountain..
Shall come into his own.
And the bell shall ring in gladness
at the mountain king's return.
And, the lake will
shine and burn.
Da, I tried to stop them.
- How long have they been gone?!
When we have the weapons, we
make straight for the mountain.
Go..go.. go!
Are you alright? - I can manage.
Let's just get out of here.
What is the meaning of this?
We caught them stealing
weapons, Sire.
Ah, enemies of the state..eh?
A disgrace bunch of mercenaries,
if ever there were, Sire.
Hold your tongue!
You do not know to
whom you speak!
This is no common criminal.
This is Thorin. Son of Thr√°in..
..Son of Thr√≥r.
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.
We have come, to
reclaim our Homeland.
I remember this town, in
the great days of old.
Fleets of boats lay at harbour.
Filled with silk and fine gems.
This was no forsaken
town on a lake..
This was the center, of
all trade in the north.
I will see those days returned.
With alliance forged
with the dwarves,
Send wealth and riches flowing once
more, from the halls of Erebor!
Death!
That is what you
will bring upon us.
Dragon fire and ruin.
If you awaken that beast,
it will destroy us all.
You can listen to this naysayer.
But, I promise you this..
..if we succeed.
All will share in the
wealth of the mountain.
You will have enough gold, to
rebuild Esgaroth ten times better!
All of you, listen to me!
You must listen. Have you
forgotten what happened to Dale?
Have you forgotten those
who died in the Firestorm?
No!
And for what purpose?
The blind ambition
of a mountain king,
So driven by greed, he could
not see beyond his own desire!
Now, now! We must not any of
us, be too quick to lay blame.
Let us not forget, that it
was Girion-lord of Dale..
Your ancestor, who failed
to kill the beast!
He is true, Sire. We
all know the story.
Arrow after arrow, he shot.
Each one, missing it's mark..
You have no right.
No right, to enter
that mountain.
I have the <i>only</i> right.
I speak to the Master
of the Menable lake.
Will you see the
prophecy fulfilled?
Will you, share.. in the
great wealth of our people?
What say you?
I say unto you..
Welcome!
Welcome! My pride..Welcome!
King under the mountain.
You do know we are one short?
Where is Bifur?
- He is not here, we'll leave him behind.
We will have to.
If we are to find the door before nightfall.
We can risk no more delays.
Not you.
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.
No, no.
Uncle, I must be there
when that door is open.
When we first look upon
the halls of our fathers.
Kili, stay here.. rest.
Join us, when you are healed.
I'll stay with the lad, my
duty lies with the wounded.
Uncle..
We grew up on tales of the mountain.
Tales you told us..
You cannot take
that away from him.
Fili.
- I will carry him, if I must.
One day, you will be king.
And, you will understand.
I cannot risk, the fate of this
quest for the sake of one dwarf.
Not even my own kin.
Fili, don't be a fool. You
belong with the company.
I belong with my brother.
By my beard! Is that the time!
Men of Dale, bring
good fortune to all!
You missed the boat as well.
No. I am done with Dwarves.
Go away!
No, no. Please!
No one will help us.
Kili is sick.
He is very sick.
What is this place?
The last city of Dale.
Now, it is a ruin.
The Desolation of Smaug.
- The sun will soon reached mid-day.
We must find the hidden door into
the mountain before it sets.
This way!
- Wait. Is this..the overlook?
Gandalf said, to meet him
here. On no account..
- Did you see him?
We have no time, to
wait on our wizard.
We are on our own. Come!
Dol Guldur.
The hill of sorcerer.
It looks completely, abandoned.
As it is meant to.
A spell of concealment
ties over this place.
Which means, our enemy is not
yet ready to reveal itself.
He has not regained
his full strength.
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message, to Lady Galadriel.
Tell her, we must
force HIS hand.
What do you mean?
- I am going in alone.
On no account, come after me.
Do I have your word?
- Yes, yes.. yes.
Wait Gandalf!
What if it's a trap?
Turn around..
..and do not come back.
It's undoubted there.. a trap.
Anything?! - Nothing!
If the map is true. The hidden
door lies directly, above us.
Up here!
You have keen eyes,
Master Baggins.
This The door gasket
That all those who doubted
us, rue this day!
Hey, we have a key.
Which means, there is somewhere
there is a key hole.
The last light of Durin's day..
Will shine upon the keyhole.
Nori. - Yeah.
We are losing the
light, come on!
Be quite! I can't hear,
when you're thumping.
I can't find it!
It's not here! It's not here!
Break it down!
Come on!
The door is sealed. It
can't be opened by force!
It's cast with magic, aren't it.
No!
<i>The last light of Durin's day.</i>
<i>Will shine upon the keyhole.</i>
That is what it says.
What did we miss?
What did we miss?
Balin?
We have lost the light.
There is no more to be done.
We had but, one chance.
Come on here, lads.
Let's move on.
Wait a minute.
Where are they going?
You can't give up now!
The setting sun..
..and the last light of
Durin's day will shine.
The last light..
last light.
And the last light!
Come back! Come back!
It is the light of the moon.
The last moon of autumn!
Where is the key?
Where is the..
It was here.
It was..just..
Erebor!
Thorin.
I know these walls.
These walls..
This stone.
You remember, Balin?
Chambers filled
with golden light.
I remember.
<i>Here in lies, the seventh
kingdom of Durin's folk.</i>
<i>May the heart of the mountain unite
all Dwarves, In defends of this home.</i>
The Throne of King.
And, what's that..above it?
The Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
And, What's that?
That.. Master Burgler.
Is why you're here.
Can you not do something?
I need herbs. Something
to bring down this fever.
I have rapeseed..???
They are no use to me. Do
you have any Kingsfoil?
No.. It's a weed. We
feed it to the pigs.
Pigs? Weed.. right.
Don't move.
You want me.. to
find the jewel?
A large white jewel. Yes!
That's it? Only.. I imagine
there's quite a few down there.
There is only one Arkenstone.
You will know it,
when you see it.
In truth lad..
I..do not know.. what you
will find down there.
You need not, if you don't want to.
There is no..dishonour in turning back.
No.. Balin!
I promised, I would do this.
And, I think.. I must try.
It never ceases to amaze me.
- What's that?
The courage of Hobbits.
Go now, with as much
luck..as you can muster.
Bilbo..
If there in fact..
..a live dragon down there.
Don't waken it.
Arkenstone.
A large..white jewel.
Very helpful.
Well..
Thief!
I..smell.. you.
I hear your breath.
I feel your hair.
Where are..you.
Where are you?
Come now.. Don't be shy.
Step into the light.
Hhmmm..
There is.. something about you.
Something you carry.
Something made of gold.
But, far more..precious!
There you there.
Thief of Shadows.
I did not come to
steal from you.
O'Smaug, the
unnessbbly, wealthy.
I merely wanted to gaze
upon your magnificence.
If you really were as gracious
as the old tale say..
You see, I did not believe them.
And, Do you now?!
Truly.
The tales and songs.
Fall utterly short, of your
enormousy host Smaug..
..the stupendous.
Do you think flattery
will keep you alive?
No..no. - No, indeed.
You seem familiar with my name, but I
don't remember smelling your kind before.
Who are you..and where
do you come from?
May I ask?
I come from under the hill.
- Under hill?
And, under hills
and over hills..
and..and.
Through the air, I am he,
who walks on the sea.
Impressive.
What else, do you claim to be?
I am..
Luck wearer..
..Riddle, riddle maker.
- Lovely titles, go on.
Barrel Rider.
- Barrels. Now, that is interesting.
Then, what about
your..little Dwarve friends?
Where are they hiding?
Da.. Dwarves?
No.. no. No, Dwarves here.
You got that all wrong.
I don't think so. Barrel Rider.
They sent you in here, to do the dirty work.
While they, skulk about outside!
Truly.. You are mistaken, O' Smaug-
Chiefest of..Craftiest of calamaties.
You have nice manners,
for a thief and a liar.
I know the smell and
taste of the dwarves.
No one better.
It is the gold,
they are drawn to treasure
like flies to dead flesh.
Did you think, I did not
know this day would come?
That a pack of Kettlin Dwarves would
come crawling back to the mountain?
Was that an earthquake?
- That my lad..
..was a dragon.
Da? - It's coming
from the mountain.
You should leave us. Take your
children, get out of here.
And, go where?
There is no where to go.
Are we going to die, Da?
No, Darling.
The dragon, it's
going to kill us.
Not if I kill it first.
The king..under the
mountain is dead.
I took his throne, I ate his
people..like a wolf among sheep.
I kill where I wish.
When, I wish!
My armour is iron!
Go! - Stop him!
Protect it. Don't let anyone find it.
- No!
I'll deal with them.
- I can't leave you! - Now, go!
Braga? - You are under arrest.
On what charge?
- Any charge, the Master chooses.
What about Bilbo?
- Give him more time.
Time to do what? To be killed?
You are afraid?
Yes.. I'm afraid.
I fear for you.
A sickness lies upon
that treasure hoard.
A sickness which drove
your granfather mad!
I am not my grandfather.
- You're not yourself!
The Thorin I know, would
not hesitate to go in there..
- I will not risk this quest for..
..the life of one, burglar.
Bilbo.. His name is Bilbo.
It's Oakenshield.. That
filthy dwarfish usurper..
He sent you in here, for
the Arkenstone..didn't he?
No! No..no.
I don't know, what
you're talking about.
Don't bother denying it.
I guessed, his foul
purpose sometime ago.
But, it matters not. Oakenshield's
quest.. will fail.
A darkness coming. It will spread
to every corner of the land!
You have been used.
Thief in the Shadow.
You're only ever a
means to an end.
The coward, Oakenshield has weighed
the value of your life and found..
It worth nothing!
No.
No, you're lying.
- What did he promised you?
A share of his treasure?
As if it were his to give.
I would not part with a single coin.
Not.. one piece of it!
My teethe are swords!
My claws are spears!
My wings.. are a hurricane!
So, it is true.
The black arrow found it's mark.
Whatdid you say?
- I was just saying..
Your reputation preceeds you.
O' Smaug.. the tirranical..
Truly, you have no
equal, on this earth.
I am almost tempted
to let you take it.
If only to see
Oakenshield, suffer.
Watch it destroy him. Watch
it corrupt his arms..
And drive him mad!
But I think not. I think,
our little game ends here.
So, tell me..thief. How
do you choose to die?
Is that you, Da?
You've killed them all.
- There are others.
Tauriel, go.
We are losing him!
Tauriel?
What are you doing?
I'm going to save him.
You are alive!
- Not for much longer!
Did you find The Arkenstone?
- The dragon's coming!
The Arkenstone?
Did you find it?
No. We have to get out.
Hold him down.
We have given him the slip.
- No. He is too cunning for that.
So, where to now?
- The western guard room.
There may be a way out.
It's too high, there's no chance that way.
- It's our only chance.
We have to try.
Come on.
I've heard tales of the
wonders of Elvish Medicine.
That was a privelege to witness.
Tauriel.
Lie still.
You cannot be her.
She is far away.
She..she is far,
far away from me.
She walks..
Under the stars
in another world.
It was just a dream.
Do you think, She
could have loved me?
Stay close.
That's it then. There
is no way out.
The last of our kin.
They must have come here..
hoping, beyond hope.
We could try to reach the mines.
My last few days.
No.
I will not die like this.
Cowering..clawing for breath.
We make for the forges.
- He will see us. Sure as dead.
Not if we split up.
Thorin, we will never make it.
Some of us might.
Lead him to the forges.
We kill the dragon.
If this is to end in fire..
then we would all burn together.
This way!
Flee..flee!
Run for your lives!
There is no where, to hide.
- Behind you!
Here!
This way! It's this way!
Come on!
Thorin!
Follow, Balin!
Come on!
The plan is not gonna work!
These furnances are stone cold.
He is right. There is no fire
hot enough, to set them ablaze.
Have we not.
I did not look to see you
so easily outwitted.
You are growing slow.. and fat!
You are dull edged..
Slug!
Put those working. Go!
Now!
Keep going, Bilbo!
You, think you can deceive me?
Barrel Rider!
You have come from Lake Town.
There is..is some sort of scheme
hatched between these filthy dwarves..
And those miserable
tarp treating lake men.
Those slithering cowards, with
their log bows and black arrows.
Perhaps, it is time.
I beg them a visit.
No.
This isn't their fault.
Wait! You cannot
go to Lake-Town.
You care about them, do you?
Good. Then, you could
watch them die!
Here! You witless worm!
You!
I am taking back,
what you stole.
You will take nothing
from me, Dwarf!
I..laid low your
warriors of old.
I instill terror, in
the heart of men.
I am King..under the mountain.
This is not your kingdom.
These are Dwarvelands.
This is Dwarves gold.
And we will have..our revenge.
I.. I'll show what revenge!
Listen to me!
Do you not know, what is coming?
I am fire.
I..am..
Death!
What have we done!
