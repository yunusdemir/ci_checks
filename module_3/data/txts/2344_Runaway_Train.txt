Yeah! I say, yeah!
Hey, Rogers.
Rogers, Looky here, man.
What's up?
Manny's won his case.
The court's ordered
to let him out of the hole.
- Great. That's great.
- Yeah.
Uh, Rogers, Warden Ranken's gonna be
on the tube in a couple of minutes.
Uh, let the dudes in the cell blocks
hear him talk that shit he talks.
Uh, put Channel 9
into the speakers, man.
Rogers? Rogers?
Have you got shit
in your veins or what, man?
I was holding my mud around here
when you were peeing in your diapers.
All right.
They'll all hear it.
Fuckin' A, man!
I say, Rogers, thanks, man. Yeah!
<i>Nobody wants prison
to be a playground.</i>
<i>We want criminals punished and locked up.</i>
<i>But don't you think
you shocked the public conscience</i>
<i>by keeping a man welded in a cell
for three years?</i>
<i>Well, a man, yes.
But, uh, Manheim is an animal.</i>
<i>He broke out of here twice,
he's robbed banks, he's a killer.</i>
<i>He doesn't care about your life, my life,</i>
<i>or even his own life...</i>
Fuck your mother!
- Hear that trash, Ranken!
- Fat-faced fagot!
- Somebody shoot that Nazi vegetable!
- Manny for president!
<i>...seventeen.
He believes in nothing,</i>
<i>so he's capable of anything.</i>
<i>I've worked in prisons
for 26 years.</i>
<i>I've seen fiends with strings of murders
and they're all afraid of Manheim.</i>
Jesus Henry Christ. Ow! Yeah!
Hey, Jonah! Jonah!
Hey, Jonah!
- Manny did it, man.
- Yeah.
He really fuckin' did it.
Yeah, that's good, man.
I'll see you in the yard.
Yeah. Yeah.
<i>Well, if, as you say,
he is an animal,</i>
<i>then why do all the other prisoners
love him so much?</i>
<i>Well, because they're...
they're mostly animals, just like he is.</i>
<i>They wanna do whatever they want,
no holds barred.</i>

Ranken, how do you like
the new renovation on your prison?
We fixed it for ya!
Ranken, your mother's a dog
and you're an asshole.
Hey, Manny! You got visitors.
On your feet, convict.
On your feet.
I've got a federal court order
to let you out of the hole.
'Course, I could ask
for a stay during the appeal.
You know the court would go for that.
I can last nine more months
through an appeal.
I could stand on my head nine months.
I oughta rack this door
and kick your brains...
Fuck you! You wouldn't do it alone.
I don't dirty my hands on scum like you.
I'm gonna let you out in the yard.
And I hope you make a move
so I can stop your clock.
That's a promise.
Yeah, a promise.
You promised to keep me in this hole
for the rest of my life.
I kept you in here for three years.
That's long enough for me, kid.
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger.
We'll see.
Please try again,
and I'll send you out of here in plastic.
You do what you have to do
and I'll do what I have to do.
Whatever happens happens.
Call the machine shop.
Spring him to the yard!
That's your mama's fart-hole, Ranken.
The bitch is loud.
You're all punks, hiding there,
yelling in the dark.
Let me tell you
where you assholes stand.
First there's God.
Then the warden. Then my guards.
Then the dogs out there in the kennel.
And finally you...
Pieces of human waste.
No good to yourselves or anybody else.
Yeah, here he is, man.
The big man.
Hey, Manny. Homeboy.
It's me, Home.
I'm blind, man. I can't see.
Hey, Manny. Here you go, man.
Let's go. Should be time for lockup.
Hey, man, let me get that for you, Manny.
What's been happening
these past three years?
Just what you know, brother. I went
out and got a fresh 30-year sentence.
- Couldn't make it without me?
- Couldn't make without the money.
- Never did know how to rob a bank.
- Hiya, Manny.
<i>The following men
have visitors...</i>
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you out.
- Not in this winter, you won't.
- I won't?
- Kiss my white ass.
- Hey, what's the...
He's a pretty good youngster.
Besides that, he pushes the laundry cart.
Welcome home, brother.
Welcome home, man.
All right, keep 'em up!
Get up! Get up!
Kill the son of a bitch!
One, two...
Come on!
Nine!
- The kid can fight.
- It's worth about two dead flies.
Yeah, but you shouldn't
judge people hard, man.
I'm gonna take a piss.
Officer, this guy! He's grabbin' my ass!
You kept him in the hole too long, Ranken.
I want you to hurt him,
you know what I mean?
Take that punk out. Take him out.
I got it. I got it.
Jab! Punch!
What are you doing?
Come on, man. Yo, man.
Yo, man, back off!
You all right, man?
And still the welterweight
champion... Buck McGeehy.
I'm sorry, Manny.
Ranken made me do it.
- Come on, punk.
- No more!
Come on. Show me somethin'.
- Come on, Manny!
- Come here, you rat stoolie. Come here.
- Come on. I got somethin' for you.
- I'm sorry, Manny!
- Come here.
- No! Stay back.
You want me?
You want my blood? Here.
There, there's my blood.
Come on, scum.
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me!
Shoot to kill, sucker. Here I am.
Come on, Ranken. Shoot to kill.
Don't send no punk
to do your business for ya.
I'm right here.
Come on. Shoot me.
I'm goin' nowhere. Come on.
Come on, Ranken. Make your move.
Hey, sucker, you show me shit!
No, bro. He's mine.
Hey, get off me! Let me go!
Jonah! Jonah!
I'll kill ya. I'll kill ya. I'll kill ya.
I'll tear his fuckin' head off!
Oh, my God.
Can't someone do something about it?
<i>Lockup.</i>
<i>Mandatory lockup.</i>
<i>All prisoners in the cell.</i>
<i>All prisoners in the cell.</i>
<i>Mandatory lockup.</i>
You look terrible.
I ain't dead.
He released me to the yard.
He wants to kill you for sure.
Nah, he's pushin' me.
He wants me to jump the wall.
He's pushin' me.
It's 30 below out there.
I'm goin'. You comin'?
Are you comin'? I'll wait for ya.
No, brother.
This is home.
I run things around here.
I can't take these ass-kickings
like I used to.
I can make it.
Then get on, brother, and do it.
I will.
Whatever happens,
don't let 'em bring you back here, man.
Nah.
I'll find some...
...nice joint in the sun.
Manny, the bulls are on the stairs.
Let's split.
- Have fun.
- You, too.
There's gonna be
convicts watching you, brother.
Don't let them ice you.
It'll break a lot of soul.
You know, you got a following,
and I love you.
Comin' through. Hit the basket, man.
Comin' through. Hey, you guys,
hit the basket, okay? Goddamn.
Comin' through.
Check out the starch
in these socks.
Check my laundry.
Get in here and check my laundry.
Hey, Buck. See you later.
You're late, man.
I'm sorry, man.
They were late with the showers. Here.
Comin' through, boss. Comin' through.
- Just hold your horses.
- Yeah.
- How you doin', Jackson?
- What's up?
Nothin' but laundry, huh?
Jackson, have I got a surprise
for you, man.
What is it?
Well, you know you told me
your son is going to
the Golden Gloves this year'?
- Yeah.
Shit!
Jackson, check 'em out, man.
- Thanks, Buck.
- You betcha.
And I'll tell you what, Jackson.
Since you have always been
so goddamn good to me,
you get these suckers for $80.
They go for $200,
but you get 'em for $80, boss.
- I don't have $80, Buck.
- No problem. I'll tell you what we do.
We'll put you on layaway plan,
that is, you get me when you get me.
- All right, my man.
- No problem. We can work it out.
- This is all right.
- Yeah. Yeah, nice, huh?
This is all right.
Ooh, mama. January 1985.
This bitch is the creme de la creme
of white pussy, isn't she, Jackson?
- She's all right.
Yeah, that Hugh Hefner sure knows
what the fuck he's doin', don't he?
Yeah. You got that right.
- Hey, Jackson.
- What?
She might be white, but she's right.
I know, Buck.
Hey, let me give you a hand.
Uh, all right.
Hey, uh, Jackson.
- You tell your boy I said good luck, a'right?
- Thanks, Buck.
- Thanks for everything.
- Aye. You betcha.
Just walkin' with the laundry, boss.
Just walkin' with the laundry.
See, man. White pussy gets
that son of a bitch every goddamn time.
Shut up.
All right, man. Come on. Come on.
Go for it. Go for it.
Thanks, youngster. I owe you one.
Hey, Manny. Take me with you.
Shit, man. I'm goin'.
I'm goin', man. I'm fuckin' goin'.
Yeah. I'm goin'. I'm goin'.
I'm gettin' outta here.
Manny.
Hey, Manny.
Shut up, fool.
What are you doin' here?
- Hey, you need me, man.
- What good are you?
I got two hands to your one,
I can more than carry my weight
and, look, I got us sweat clothes.
Son of a bitch.
Okay, fool. Get your clothes off
and grease down.
All right.
Ooh, mama!
This shit is nasty.
Goddamn.
Okay, Manny. What do we do now'?
Keep your mouth shut.
You talk too much.
Comin' down.
- We gotta go in there?
- I am.
Duffel bag.
Pull the cover over.
Oh, man. I don't like this shit.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
- I'm comin', man. I'm comin'.
- Keep up.
It stinks in here, man. Goddamn.
What's the matter?
You never been in a sewer before?
No.
Manny, wait up a minute. Wait up.
- Manny, I put my hands in a pile of shit.
- Don't worry. It'll rinse off.
Here, give me that.
If you're gonna get sick,
this is the place to do it.
Oh, man. This is nasty.
This is nasty. God damn.
Wait! Man.
Oh, man. This is so gross.
- Okay, what do we do now'?
- Here, hold it.
Hold it! Hold it! Like a baby.
Like a baby, hold it!
It stinks in here, man.
You don't like that smell?
That's the smell of freedom, brother.
- I'm goin'.
- Wait. Uh, okay, wait.
Hey, Manny. Here, man.
- Give me the light.
- Yeah, the light.
- Duffel bag.
- Duffel bag.
Okay, wait, man.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You know, Ranken's gonna
fuckin' shit his pants, man.
Ranken's gonna fuckin' die.
Hey, Manny.
- Hey, Manny?
Hey, Manny, where's the light?
- Fell.
- Where'd it fall?
300 feet into American river.
Oh, man. Nobody told me
about 300 feet. I'm scared of heights.
Nobody told you 'cause nobody invited you.
- You wanna go back, go ahead.
- No, man.
- Me, I'm goin'.
- No, man.
Manny! Manny!
Manny!
I'm dyin'!
Manny! I can't breathe!
Manny!
Manny! Manny! Manny! Manny!
They came this way all right.
No doubt about it.
He did it.
The son of a bitch, he did it.
Okay.
Manny! Manny! Manny! Manny!
Stop searching the prison.
Notify the state police
and get their pictures out.
You know what to do.
God, don't kill them.
Let me do it.
Manny! Hold up a goddamn minute.
Get your tail out
from between your legs.
- Manny! I don't wanna die.
- I'm hurtin', too.
At least you got shoes!
How much farther we gotta go, man?
Half a mile. Who knows?
Maybe I can make half a mile.
Oh, man.
Shoes. I need shoes.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Put that bench next to the door there.
What? Oh.
I need some fuckin' shoes.
You know, it's unbelievable, man.
Only two other guys even got out once,
and you beat that sucker
three times. Yeah.
Manny, don't you know?
Ranken is knee-walkin' pissed off, man.
Shit.
And the dudes, man.
Oh, Manny, the dudes... They love it.
They love it.
Freeze, sucker.
Hey, man. Nobody's gonna hear us.
Just don't do it.
Hey, Manny. You don't treat me
like your punk, okay?
- Well, you don't like it?
- No.
Well, you're a prizefighter.
Kick my ass.
Make your move.
No.
I'm not gonna give you
no reason to kill me, Manny.
- Please don't.
- Okay.
I need some shoes, Manny.
What we got?
Shoes. Let there be shoes, man.
I want that, Manny.
I want that. Shit.
I need some shoes, man.
I need some sh...
Manny! Check it out, man.
Check it out.
Take one for the stomach,
give it here.
Ooh, mama. That shit is fine.
Okay. Come on. Let's go.
Wait. Wait, man.
I need shoes. I need shoes.
I got shoes. I got shoes.
I need socks... I got fuckin' socks.
Give me a minute, man.
Just a minute.
Okay.
- Let's get this sucker.
- You know where it's goin'?
Anywhere's fine by me.
No, I'm not going anywhere.
I don't wanna ride to a parking lot.
Hey, look. Look here.
What?
There's my limousine
to Broadway right there.
Why?
- Why that one?
- 'Cause I want it.
We're movin', man. We're movin'.
Thank you, Jesus. Shit. Shit.
Shit, we make a hell of a team,
don't we, man?
Don't we?
Hey! That looks like Al's train!
What in hell's he doin' out there?
He looks sick. Damn. Damn. Al!
Better call the paramedics.
Somethin's wrong.
Take it easy, Manny.
They know what they're doin'.
- Pulasky! Hello, Pulasky?
- Pulasky.
This is Cassidy.
Al fell off the engine. He's dead.
You've got a runaway coming your way
on track two.
- What did you say?
<i>- Four units. Stop them, for God sakes!</i>
<i>- Speak up, Pulasky.</i>
- Uh, okay.
- Switch it to track 11.
- I can't. It's too late.
Central?
Damn you, Central.
Emergency!
Pick up the goddamn phone!
Ooh, boy. Would I like to have
some of this here for dessert. To go.
Hey, Ruby. Why don't you
answer the phone?
Hey, come on, Ruby.
You're pretty enough.
Oh, shit. Your ass is so lazy.
I don't know why the fuck
you got a job here.
Uh, yeah. Central. Dave Prince speaking.
<i>This is Pulasky. Give me Barstow.</i>
Yeah, hold it, Pulasky.
Hold it my ass! Where the hell is Barstow?
We got an emergency, a big emergency.
<i>- We got four unmanned units.</i>
- What?
I said we got runaway units.
Four of them. They're headed this way.
Uh, uh... Ruby, go get Frank, now.
Run. Come on.
Goddammit, get moving now,
we got an emergency here
Hold it, Pulasky, okay?
Uh, he's coming.
It's the phone, Frankie.
Frank! Frank, get your ass out here, man.
We got a runaway on 11.
<i>Central?
Where are you, Central? Goddammit!</i>
I'm here, Pulasky.
What seems to be the trouble?
<i>We got a runaway on track 11.
Goddamn engineer fell off the train.</i>
- You're sure nobody else is on board?
<i>- How the hell do I know?</i>
<i>It's only gone about nine miles
and it's increasing speed.</i>
Nine miles already?
<i>That's right. What the
hell are we gonna do? You better...</i>
- Hey, now, be quiet! Will you calm down?
<i>- Okay. Okay.</i>
Now, look, what I want you to do,
I want you to line her onto the main line
on track one.
<i>- Okay.</i>
- You got it?
<i>- Right.</i>
- I'll take things over from there.
Right, Frank.
Shit!
This sucker is flyin', Manny.
We should've hooked it
to those freight cars by now.
Oh, smile, man. We're free. Yeah.
- You think so, huh'?
- Yeah.
Hey, Manny. I want you to know
I'm proud to be your deputy, partner.
Look, kid, I appreciate what you done,
but you ain't no kind of partner to me.
Don't be clowning yourself.
I don't like it.
Look at them tattoos.
They'll look really nice
in a swimming pool in Acapulco.
What did I do to deserve all this shit
you're slinging at me, man?
You don't know nothin' from nothin'.
Bein' around me is really stupid.
I'm at war with the world
and everybody in it.
And you're gonna get hurt.
- I don't get you, man.
- Well. rapos usually are dumb.
Rapo? I ain't no goddamn Rapo, man!
Where'd you get that from?
- It's on your rap sheet.
Busted for rape two years ago.
Shit, man!
That was a statutory rape.
She was 15
and I was older than her.
That's good.
Whoo!
What's wrong with you?
You dyin' for company?
What? You expect somebody
to be watching or something?
I expect nothin'.
She's gaining speed real fast.
She'll hit your territory in no time.
<i>Her brakes are burning up.</i>
Are you nuts?
The brakes on the runaway burnt off.
How in the fuck did that happen?
Didn't they check it?
Hey, the throttle must be jammed
wide open in run eight.
Oh, damn!
There she goes.
Oh, God, man.
What are we gonna do?
I got a wife and two kids, man.
- I ain't got no money like Michael Jackson.
- Calm down. Don't panic.
- Come on, the system's foolproof.
- I need money. Shit!
Why? Because you designed it?
That I did, my boy, and I know how
to use it. Now, let me show you.
We'd better fly over the highway.
Are you serious?
Jesus, those scum could
never make it this far out.
We're up here freezing
our asses off for nothing.
Hey, shut your mouth
and keep your eyes on the glacier.
This guy. I'm telling you.
He'd do the same thing
I would do.
Hey, You know I just thought about that
bank that you ripped off in Reno. Whoo-ee!
I was in reform school.
Man, that was so fucking great.
Two million simoleons. Man, that was hot.
Two million is a slight exaggeration.
The insurance company.
Standard procedure.
Yeah, but it was still fucking great, man.
I'll tell you what.
Hey, Manny, I know this jug outside Frisco.
It's good for half a mil.
They handle payroll
for S&A Sugar,
and S&A Sugar
is a big outfit, man.
Yeah. That's what I've been
dreamin' about...
A really good score. You know what I mean?
And I'm gonna party, ooh!
Yeah. Shit.
I'm gonna go to Mardi Gras,
I'm gonna go to Vegas,
and I'm gonna go with enough money
in my hip pocket
to catch some fine bitches.
You know what I mean?
You know, I spend
almost every night of my life
dreamin' about this kind of shit.
- Dreamin'?
- Yeah.
Dreamin'.
That's bullshit.
You're not gonna do nothin' like that.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna get a job.
That's what you're gonna do...
you gonna get a little job.
Some job a convict can get,
like scraping off trays
in a cafeteria or cleaning out toilets.
And you're gonna hold on
to that job like gold, because it is gold!
Let me tell you, Jack, that is gold.
You listenin' to me?
And when that man walks in
at the end of the day...
and he comes to see how you done,
you ain't gonna look in his eyes.
You'll look at the floor because
you don't wanna see that fear in his eyes
when you jump up and grab his face
and slam him to the floor...
and make him scream and cry for his life.
So you look right at the floor, Jack.
Pay attention to
what I'm sayin', motherfucker.
And then he's gonna look around the room...
see how you done.
He's gonna say,
"Oh, you missed a little spot over there."
"Jeez, You didn't get this one here.
What about this little-bitty spot?"
And you're gonna suck
all that pain inside you
and you're gonna clean that spot.
And you're gonna clean that spot
until you get that shiny clean.
And on Friday you'll pick up your paycheck.
And if you could do that,
if you could do that
you could be president of
Chase Manhattan Corporations.
If you could do that.
Not me, man.
I wouldn't do that kind of shit.
I'd rather be in fuckin' jail.
More's the pity, youngster.
More's the pity.
Could you do that kind of shit?
I wish I could.
I wish I could.
Central. Central. Eastbound 12.
<i>Eastbound 12.</i>
Barstow here.
Why did you stop us?
<i>There's a runaway
coming at you on track one. Hear me?</i>
- <i>Number 12, answer me!</i>
- I don't see any runaway.
<i>If you were close enough to see her,
you'd be dead. Get it?</i>
<i>She's about four miles away.</i>
<i>Now I want you
to pull onto track two at once.</i>
<i>Repeat, at once!</i>
Oh, my, God.
No, are you serious?
Hey, Ruby, what's going on?
Hey, hey, you can't
go in there right now.
Come on, Ruby.
That eastbound 12 is crawling.
Who's the incompetent bastard on her?
He better get his ass
in the clear fast!
Oh, man.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
I told you something was fucked up.
Maybe we're on some
express run or something.
Wake up, wacko!
We just blew that caboose to hell
without even slowing down.
Something screwy is goin' on here.
Look! Look. All the handrails are gone.
Maybe the engineer has croaked.
Hey, man. Engineers do not just croak!
Why don't the whistle ever blow, huh?
What are you, out of your mind?
I just wanted to see if it worked, man.
You said the engineer was croak...
Let go.
You think this is some
cops-and-robbers game.
Hey, man. You picked the train.
- You're right.
- Yeah.
<i>State police calling chopper one.</i>
<i>State police calling chopper one.
Come in please.</i>
<i>State police calling chopper one.</i>
<i>We have information
regarding escaped prisoners.</i>
Ranken, that's your radio.
<i>Railroad security called,</i>
<i>they found some prison clothes
in a switch yard.</i>
<i>Looks like prison brogans.</i>
- How'd they get so far?
- What did I tell you?
Tell them I'll be there in ten minutes.
Have some officers ready.
<i>Roger, state police. We're on our way.</i>
Let's have some fun.
Maybe we just oughta clear out of here.
I mean, maybe we just oughta jump for it.
What do you say?
We can break our necks any time we want.
Yeah. That makes sense.
- Let's find out what's happenin'.
- How we gonna do that, man?
- Go up front and find out.
- Yeah.
Find out what's happenin'.
Go up front and find out
what the hell is goin' on.
I want that, man.
- What?
- Tuck that in on you someplace.
All right.
And wait till I give you
the office before you attack.
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
Hello, Mr. MacDonald.
Don't tell anyone about the runaway.
We don't wanna panic the passengers.
Besides, we've got
the company's reputation to uphold.
What's the latest on that train?
It went straight through
the caboose of Granville 12.
Well, anyone hurt?
Nobody. What's the story on the engineer?
He had a heart attack... old fart.
He made everyone bananas tryin' to keep
that engine from goin' to scrap. Get that.
- What's the speed?
- About 70.
Hey, Barstow, why don't you stop her?
You put the system in.
Cost the company $4.5 million.
Listen, Eddie,
this system is designed for the efficient
dispatching of trains when they're manned,
not to stop them when they're umanned.
The brake shoes have burned off.
The over-speed control
must have gotten screwed up
from the collision!
But don't worry, Eddie.
We'll do everything we can
to avoid any other casualties.
Frank, hope you haven't forgotten
about the Seneca bridge.
Dave, could you get us some coffee?
Come on.
- What about the bridge?
- I'm taking care of it.
What about the bridge?
I'd like to remind you.
Seneca is an old bridge.
So what?
Are you gonna get the coffee, Dave?
Mr. MacDonald,
by the time that runaway
reaches this bridge, it'll be doin' 90.
The restriction for that bridge is 50.
Get that runaway on the spur in Jordan
and derail her.
Best idea, sir.
I don't need you to tell me if I'm right!
Derail that son of a bitch!
I don't care about engines!
- I don't wanna lose the bridge!
- Eddie, this system is designed
so that I can get everyone out of our way
and onto the siding.
Meanwhile, we'll think of something else.
Right now it's four engines,
no people aboard...
and if I let you jerk off with your system,
this wild animal's gonna kill somebody
sooner or later.
You know what that'll cost the company?
Do you?
Derail her. That's my order.
You say derail, then we derail.
But these people are witnesses.
It's your decision, Eddie.
Yeah. Yeah, it's my decision.
<i>Central calling Jordan.</i>
<i>Central calling Jordan.</i>
<i>Signal maintainer 40, this is an emergency.</i>
<i>Signal maintainer 40, acknowledge.
This is an emergency.</i>
<i>Central calling Jordan.
Signal maintainer 40, come in.</i>
<i>Where the hell are you?
Central calling Jordan.</i>
Jordan. Signal maintainer 40 here.
<i>Central here.</i>
<i>There is an unmanned runaway
heading west on track one.</i>
<i>You're gonna have to
line her into the siding...</i>
<i>use the manual switch,
then get out of the way.</i>
Superintendent MacDonald
wants to derail her.
- Yeah.
- You got that name?
- Mr. Eddie MacDonald.
- Yeah.
I'll be goddamned.
Son of a bitch.
Oh!
Hey, you hear that?
Come on, Manny. Come on, Manny.
See? See, I told you, man. I told you.
I knew we had an engineer on this sucker.
- All right, kid.
- I said blow, baby, blow!
Boy, this is gonna be somethin'.
Huh?
- Signal maintainer 40 here at Jordan.
<i>- Central.</i>
Listen, did I hear you right
<i>that that runaway
is supposed to be unmanned?</i>
Yeah, that's right.
<i>Well, let me tell you somethin', mister.</i>
I think you're wrong.
The whistle!
The goddamn whistle's blowing!
Derailing is out. Run, old man, run!
Line her through!
Somebody's blowing the goddamn whistle
on that train, Mr. MacDonald
and you would have
killed him just like that.
My God!
Okay, next hurdle.
Come on, big train.
I'll slap your fat diesel ass. Come on!
D'you like 'em - anchovies?
I don't remember havin' any.
Well, if you had 'em,
you'd remember having 'em, man.
I tell you what.
- Get over here.
- Yeah. What?
I don't think he saw us.
Okay, okay. What do we do now'?
Let him come.
When he gets two-thirds through that door,
we'll nail him.
Uh...
- We ain't gonna kill him, are we?
- No.
Okay.
- Unless we have to.
- Um...
We'll find out what's goin' on.
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
Oh, man.
He's in trouble out there.
Man, come on, let's go help him.
Come on. Let's go help him, Manny.
Down!
Oh, man.
What are you doin' here?
What am I doing here? I work on this train.
- What are you doing here?
- What are we doin' here?
I'll tell you what we're doin' here.
We're on our way to Las Vegas
to see our close and personal friend,
Wayne Newton.
Why? Are you collecting tickets
or somethin', sweetheart?
Hey, sweetheart, how would
you like a really good fuck, huh?
Just try it. Just try it!
Freeze on that bullshit.
What happened to you?
I was tired. I was taking a nap.
I shouldn't have done it, but I did it.
So what?
My head got hit
when we slammed into that caboose.
I don't know what happened,
but there's no engineer on this train.
There's nobody on this train but us.
Hey, she's lyin', man.
We heard the whistle.
No. I blew the whistle!
Hey, you're just tryin' to get
us off-guard and get us busted.
Listen to me. This runaway's
gonna run into something very fast.
I climbed back here to the last engine
where it's safer. Don't you get it?
- I don't believe her bullshit.
- You don't believe me?
You just look out the window,
you don't believe me.
Can you see how fast we are going?
This train is out of control.
My God, we can get killed.
Then we'd better do somethin' about it.
What about the hostler helper?
A woman. Goddammit.
Does she know anything
about running a locomotive?
Shit!
The only person on the whole train
is a woman.
How lucky can I get?
- Now what?
- The chief of security from Stonehaven.
His name is Ranken
and he wants to see you.
- I don't have time for him.
- He says it's very important.
- He know about the runaway?
- I don't think so.
Good. Tell him we'll see him later.
- How far to the bridge? What's the ETA?
- 25 minutes.
Shit.
- Seneca station. Seneca station.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
This is MacDonald at Central Control.
There's a runaway's coming your way.
It's going over 80.
<i>That's too fast for the bridge.</i>
I know it's going too fast for the bridge.
Have your emergency crew together.
<i>Well, Christ! Can't you stop it?</i>
Uh... We're gonna stop it.
Just...
just have 'em there
just in case, huh?
Asshole!
It won't do a thing.
Agh!
I told you,
I already tried it from the second engine.
Why not?
I'm no expert. All I know is when a bunch
of engines are hooked up together
everything operates from the lead engine...
you stop the lead engine, all of 'em stop.
I don't believe this shit!
We get out of a maximum security prison
and wind up on an unmanned train with
this bitch and bad news.
- You guys bust out of Stonehaven?
- Yeah. So what?
Man, why'd you tell her that?
You told her, clown.
What difference does it make?
She gonna drop a dime on us?
No.
Boy, I guess you guys
picked the wrong train.
How come you didn't go up
to the lead engine?
How come you come back here?
You can't cross
from the second to the first engine.
It's a stream-liner. It's an old A-unit.
It doesn't have a walkway.
There's a door in front, but I tried it.
Must've jammed during the collision.
Oh, man. What do we do now'?
Did they know about us?
They do now, after we hit that caboose.
If they woke up, there'd be all
kind of pigs all over this thing
whenever it stops, wherever it stops.
Ranken's all over this territory.
Yeah. Maybe he'll find us.
I ain't givin' up. No
matter what I have to do.
No matter who has to die,
I ain't givin' him that pleasure.
No fuckin' way.
I don't wanna die, Manny.
I ain't gettin' caught alive.
And you neither.
I don't know, man.
I don't know nothin' right now.
I can't even think straight right now.
Just do what I tell you
and don't crap on yourself.
I let you tag along to be a regular,
not a piece of shit.
What you're doin' ain't nothin', man.
We don't stand a chance if we jump out.
Look, I can’t jump here. This is suicide.
If you jump here, you're gonna break
every bone in your body. And then what?
- They've been broke before.
- I'm with you, Manny.
I'm with you till the wheels come off.
- You can't go!
- No?
You can't leave me alone here.
I don't care who jumps with me.
I know how to stop the train!
Why didn't you tell
us that to start with, goddamn it?
We probably can't stop it a 100%,
but maybe we can slow it down.
You tell me how.
If we can disconnect the bus line cables,
the electric cables between the engines,
the engines will shut down one at a time.
Now, it's not gonna be easy. We...
They'll be frozen solid
and we don't have the right tools,
but it's a chance, you know,
it's a better chance than jumping out.
You better know what you're talkin' about.
Look, don't threaten me.
What's the matter with you?
Come on, let's go.
That one.
The one next to the coupling?
Yeah. Here.
Take me up.
You do it. You have two hands.
- Okay. Hold on to me.
- Use the wrench.
Hey, I did it! I got it!
Get me up. Get me up. I got it!
Frank, look at this.
Come and look at this.
Look at what?
The runaway. It slowed down!
See? It's at 80, and still holding.
It was 92 a couple of minutes ago.
- I don't understand it.
- The girl. Sure, somehow she slowed it.
It doesn't matter. 80, 180.
The bridge won't take
the train goin' that fast.
How far to the bridge now?
Five minutes.
- Let's go.
- Right.
- We can use the fire extinguisher.
- Right. Right.
I lost it!
She's coming!
ETA is in about three minutes!
Get me up.
Manny! Manny!
Get her, man. Get her!
I got you.
Hold my hand. Hold my hand!
Yeah. Grab my hand! Come on.
Look! Look!
Manny! Look, Manny! Look!
Get me Central Control. Quick!
Oh, man. Oh, man.
- That's crazy.
- What?
There are three people on the runaway.
Holy shit. Where'd they come from?
How do I know? We just saved three lives.
Not for long.
Dave, will you give me break?
Will you give me a fucking break?
You know, I really wish I could, Frank,
but we've got five minutes,
just five minutes to get
the runaway off the main line,
or else we're gonna wind up with a head-on
with the Northeast Express.
It's no big deal, dummy.
We'll just head her into the 14.
Great idea, Frank.
Why don't you just send her to Elkin's?
- So?
- No, no, no. That's the chemical plant.
She'd never make
the curve at that speed.
She'll flip and wipe out the whole plant.
There'll be toxic chemicals
from here to Kansas.
We'd better warn 'em.
You know, girl, I ought to thank you.
I mean, it's one thing to jump
and wrap yourself around a tree or a pole.
But to wind up spilt all over a ditch
with a broken hip waitin' for the bulls,
what a waste.
Ah! Yeah, man. You ain't kiddin'.
Hey, look. We're almost there.
Hey, come on, Manny. Let's rip this fucker.
- Is that the door?
- It's jammed or something.
- I couldn't open it.
- Hey, don't you worry, sweetheart.
You know, we've been
breakin' through doors all our lives.
Come on, man. You can't
do it with that hand of yours. Let me in.
Let me help.
- Let me in there.
- I got it!
You can't do it with
that hand of yours.
Shit.
Shit.
Bullshit.
Take the first west at Macketsburg.
Get onto the Bellport siding.
Get the emergency crew right in
and evacuate the plant immediately.
Get 'em as far away from
the plant as possible.
You got 10 minutes, if you're lucky.
Get off my back, woman!
Mr. Barstow, I have two
very dangerous prisoners on the loose.
I don't give a shit if your whole
goddamn prison's on the loose.
I got a killer train on my hands
with three goddamn people on board,
and I got no free
tracks left to play with.
Frank...
So do me a fucking favor and get lost, or
I'm gona have your ass kicked out of here!
On the double!
You keep an eye on her.
I'm gonna go take a leak.
Do that.
I hope you don't like it and
want to do something about it.
Yeah, I didn't think you wanted to
back up that loud conversation.
Wipe that piss off your face.
I don't wanna hear any more
crap out of you.
If I don't get my convicts back,
the prison will be out of control.
You know what a riot in
a maximum security prison looks like?
Your brains are too small to imagine it.
- Now, where's the train?
- Track one.
I'm gonna kick your teeth in.
You're playing with me.
You tell me real straight. Got it?
- You tell me how to find it with a helicopter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll show you.
I'll be goddamned if I've come all this way
to get stuck by some goddamn door! Shit!
Don't give up now.
We're gonna make it through this.
How?
- I don't know.
- Yeah.
But I know the people
are clearing the tracks,
and I know that they won't abandon us.
How do you know that?
I just feel it in my heart.
There are miracles.
You're stupid.
You know how stupid you sound?
Miracle, my ass.
One must count on oneself. Nobody else.
You think I'm waitin' around
for a miracle to happen?
I ain't waitin' for no miracle.
I'm goin' out and around.
Out and around.
I'm goin' there. That's where I'm goin'.
You can't make it. I told you before.
There's nothing to hold on to out there.
There's no walkways.
I told you, you can't make it.
I'll make it.
If I have to fly the five
feet, like a birdie,
I'll fly it. I'll make it.
Hey, Manny, you can't do it,
not with that arm of yours.
But I can do it.
I can whip this fucker.
So, give me a drink.
Let me go for it.
All right!
Hey, sucker. Lighten up.
Ooh.
- You are so brave.
- Yeah, I know it.
Okay. Okay.
Goggles. Yeah, goggles
I'm going.
Here I go.
Hey, Manny?
- Partners?
- Yeah.
Fuckin' A.
Fuckin' A.
Okay. Okay.
You can make it.
You can make it, Buck.
You got guts, kid.
You got real guts.
More guts than brains.
What did you say?
No brains. No brains.
That's mean.
That's the truth.
Come on, Buck. Let's go.
Let's go, sucker.
- Now! Make it now! Jump for it!
- He's gotta come back.
- Go for it, sucker. Come on.
- I can't watch this.
Then sit down!
Don't give up on me, sucker.
I ain't lettin' you quit.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Don't give up. Argh!
Don't quit, sucker. Get out there!
He can't do it. Don't you care about him?
Doesn't his life mean anything to you?
- Get outta here!
- Ah!
Get back, punk.
You wanna be a tough guy?
You wanna be a legend? Go back!
Let him in!
What are you doin', Manny?
Get the fuck up, sucker. Get out there.
Show me you ain't got shit for blood!
- Give me a break.
- Oh-ho.
Get out there now.
Don't you talk to me.
Don't you talk back!
I don't know who you are.
You wanna be a tough guy?
Get the fuck outta here. Get out.
No! No! Stop it!
You wanna kill me, or what?
If I wanted to punch your ticket,
you'd be long gone.
You can do it.
I'm tellin' you, you can do it.
I can't do it, Manny. I can't do it.
You don't know what you could do,
what you can't.
You're a coward.
Why'd I break out with a chicken? Get up.
- Leave him alone.
- Show me some, kid.
- Get the fuck up. You hear me?
- Stop it!
Get the fuck up!
No! No!
Get the fuck outta here!
- Okay.
- No.
- Okay.
- No. No.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. I'm goin'.
No. No, he's using you.
He's using you. Don't go!
You're going sucker!
You gonna do what I tell you, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- That's right. You're gonna do it.
Do it yourself, if you're so brave!
- I would if I had two hands.
- Bullshit!
You think you can sacrifice
someone else's life instead of your own?
You're an animal.
No. Worse.
Human.
Human!
Get the fuck out there. Now.
Get out! Do it! Get out!
I'm not letting you go. No! No!
Ahhh!
Don't you touch her!
I'll kill you, Manny. I'll kill you.
- You die, sucker. You die.
- I'll kill you, man.
Don't make me kill you. I'll kill you.
I'll kill you, man.
Don't make me kill you. I'll kill you.
Come at me, I'll kill you.
Ah!
Drop the shiv. Don't make me kill you, man.
I'll beat you to fuckin' death.
Come on, Manny. Try me. Try me!
Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him!
Oh, Manny...
I thought you was my friend.
I thought we was partners.
Shit.
You know, you're worse than Ranken,
when the truth comes out.
At least he's upfront with his bullshit.
You was a hero.
You was a hero
to all of us back in that shithole.
God damn.
Oh, Manny.
Manny...
It's your mess, Frank.
You should've listened to me
and derailed her.
So, what do we do?
We... I shunt 'em onto the siding
and in 15 minutes they run out of track?
And with the...
- Elkin station. Elkin station!
<i>- Elkin. Go ahead.</i>
Gilchrist, this is MacDonald.
<i>Yes, MacDonald.</i>
- Barstow here.
- Come on. Come on.
Now listen carefully and act fast.
You have about one minute
to line the runaway under the old spur.
The runway we don't use any more.
<i>- You've got it.</i>
- Now go.
Good, good, good. Good boy.
We'll save the chemical plant, huh?
We're still gonna lose those three people.
<i>There are still a lot of beaming faces</i>
<i>at NASA headquarters in Houston today</i>
<i>over Wednesday's successful launch of
the two new communications satellites.</i>
<i>The number of sophisticated experiments
will apparently be doubled</i>
<i>on next month's launch
of an Anglo-French weather satellite.</i>
<i>That according to launch director Hogan.</i>
<i>He praised the crew of
the just-completed mission...</i>
I still don't understand.
How did this happen?
Why couldn't we stop it,
with all this junk?
I mean, with all this high technology.
Some things can't be explained.
Look!
Holy shit.
See that, Ranken? You see that?
Come on, Ranken!
You'll never take me back, Ranken! Try it!
Try it! You'll never
get me alive, sucker.
What's the matter,
Ranken? You got no fuckin' guts?
No guts. No guts, Ranken.
You hear me? You'll never stop this train,
you hear me, Ranken?
You'll never stop it. You hear me, sucker?
I told you. You hear me, Ranken?
I told you I'd break free. I done it.
Here I am, right in your face, sucker.
Come on down.
I won! I won!
I want you down, Ranken. Come on down.
Come on down! Here I am.
I'm alive, sucker. Come on down, Ranken.
Ranken, you hear me?
You hear me?
You'll never get me.
You'll never stop this train.
Never. Never! You understand?
I won. I won! I won!
What was that? What was that?
Huh?
What happened? What happened?
They gave up on us.
They switched us off
the main track onto a dead end.
What does that mean?
We're gonna crash any minute.
Uh-huh.
Hold me.
I don't wanna die alone.
- We're gonna be all right.
- Yeah.
We're gonna be fine.
We all die alone.
Come on, Ranken.
Come on, sucker, here I am.
Come on. I'm out of my cage now.
I'm out, out of my cage.
I'm never going back. Never.
You'll never stop me. Never!
I'm out. You hear me? You'll never...
You can't get across, Manny.
I'm out of my cage. You'll never stop me.
You're gonna learn, kid.
It's all up here.
I'll cross the stinking thing!
I'll cross it! I'll cross it!
Watch me.
Waitin' for ya.
Ah!
Got you!
Is Jonah alive?
Is Jonah alive?
Yes. Yes!
That's good.
He'll be glad.
Don't do it, Manny.
You'll burn for it. You know you will.
Push the button.
We're on a dead-end siding.
We're gonna crash in five minutes.
Then we'll have a nice
five-minute ride together.
You think you're a hero, huh? Shit.
You're scum.
We're both scum, brother.
You're going to push that
button and stop this train!
We've only got a few minutes!
We got all the time in the world.
You'll die, bastard.
You'll die with me.
Fuck you!
You're as afraid to die as anybody else.
And I never let you free, you hear me?
I am free, Ranken.
I am free.
You think you won.
I know how to die, too.
Win, lose. What's the difference?
What about that punk and the girl?
No, no.
It's just you and me.
Manny! Shut it down!
Manny, goddammit! Shut it down, Manny!
Manny! Shut it down!
That's all you gotta do! Manny!
He knows what he wants to do.
Manny! Shut it down!
That's all you gotta do!
Shut it down, Manny! Shut it down!
Shut it down, goddammit!
That's all you gotta do, Manny!
Shut it down! Manny!
He did it.
He did it.
