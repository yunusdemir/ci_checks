What's up, Claire?
Hey.
So this is it, huh?
Just you and me.
End of days..
Ha.
Yeah.
Uh, have you talked to Ron lately?
Ron is in Barbados snorkeling
for the ever-elusive
Double Back Saddle Fish
and he left explicit instructions
not to be disturbed.
Yeah, well, if you owned this place
you'd be off to Barbados, too.
Sure, I would. Especially if I had
two saps back at home
waiting to cover for me.
Oh, did you get your camera fixed?
No, it's totaled.
I have to send it back
to Pana-suck-ass.
I have my microphones though,
so we can make do with EVP
investigations.
OK.
Oh hey, that reminds me.
I have to show you something.
So...
I was trolling around on some of
the paranormal forums last night
and I came across something
pretty interesting.
You're definitely
gonna wanna see this.
What is it?
Hold on.
Just watch...
Look closely...
I missed it the first time...
It's gonna blow your mind...
It's really heavy...
You bastard!
So good!
Oh my God.
Every time.
Oh my god.
What room did you take?
Uh...216.
Of course.
Hey, I've been here
since last night.
That's just the way it goes.
225 is taken,
other than that
it's pretty much wide open.
Second floor only though,
remember?
Third floor is already done.
Only one guest?
Brutal.
Eh, it doesn't take
a genius to figure out
why this place
is going out of business.
Hm.
OK, I'll take room 214.
I figured we'd take
seven to seven shifts.
Something like that...
Alright.
Sounds good.
I'll bring it back down.
OK, sweetie.
Come here.
OK.
OK, if I could just
get you to sign that.
Here's your room key,
number 224.
You wanna head up
to the top of the stairs
and take a right
and another quick right,
sorta like a dog leg.
And then you go about
halfway down the hallway
and it's on the right hand side.
You can't miss it.
Thank you.
Do you know who that is?
It's Leanne Reese-Jones.
OK.
She was the mom on
"Like Mother Like Son"!
Dude, she's super-famous.
OK, whatever.
Man...
Leanne Rease-Jones...
I wonder what she's doing here.
She's guest-speaking at
some convention in Pottstown.
How do you know that?
She told me.
What?
What else did she tell you?
Nothing.
Why are you acting so weird?
I'm not.
Well, here's her autograph.
Just relax.
Whatever. Why are you
being so grouchy today?
I'm not.
I'm just stressed.
This site is killing me.
Let me see it.
Mm...
It looks good.
I hate web design.
It looks really good.
I like the little ghosts.
It's not the most professional,
but it's not bad.
There's a lot of
money in this right now.
I just... I have to act fast.
Looks really good.
I like it.
And, you know,
once we get some proof on there,
it won't matter what it looks like.
Hey, so I was thinking.
It seems like when something
really creepy happens,
nobody else is around, right?
Like every time you've seen stuff,
you were alone.
So...
I was just thinking that since
the hotel is practically empty,
we might have a chance
of making some real contact.
Does that makes sense?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think this weekend's
gonna be it.
We're gonna get something good.
I can feel it.
- What?
- What?
What?
What...?
Front desk.
Yes, Ms. Reese-Jones.
Oh, sure.
I'll send them right up for you.
You're welcome.
I forgot to stock the towels.
I'll get them.
Good, save me the ulcer.
That Gayle in 225
is driving me nuts
and I don't want her to see me.
Oooh, that lady with the kid?
I know, what's her deal?
She was giving me
total agro vibes upstairs.
She had a huge fight
with her husband
and she's staying here 'til Sunday
with her son as payback.
She's having a very hard time
and she wants him to realize
how hard his life is without her.
How do you know all that?
She told me.
Why do you seem so surprised
that I talk to the guests?
Um-hm
Go on, superfan.
Don't keep the talent waiting.
Miss Rease-Jones?
I have your towels...
Miss Rease-Jones?
Oh, be a lamb and
hand me one of those...
Thank you.
You're welcome, Miss Rease-Jones.
Call me Lee.
Ok.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Claire
You're a life saver, Claire.
Oh, no no... I couldn't.
I couldn't
Come on. You'll hurt
an old lady's feelings.
Thanks, Miss, uh, Lee.
I'm a really big fan of yours!
"Like Mother Like Son" was
one of my all time favorite shows,
and you were amazing in it
and in 'The Waking of Eleanor...
I love that film.
Yeah, I used to watch it all
the time growing up with my mom.
Leven used to put my hair in,
like, little braids, like you did.
I mean, they never
looked as good though.
Well, thank you.
That's very nice of you to say.
And what do you do, Claire?
I work at the front desk.
So if there's anything else
that you need, just let me know.
I mean, this is our
last weekend open
so Luke and I are
the only ones on staff today.
Yeah, we're actually sleeping
here instead of going home.
It's pretty crazy.
I meant in life.
Are you an aspiring actress?
Is that what makes you such
an astute fan of my work?
Me?
No... I just work at the hotel.
Oh...
But... I'm kinda like... you
know..in between... stuff.
OK...
Uh, Claire...
The towels.
Right.
Of course, yes.
There you go.
How did it go?
You two gonna
collaborate on something?
She kind of made me
feel like an asshole.
Well, she's an actress.
What's that supposed to mean?
And what do you know
about actresses anyway?
I don't know a lot,
but I do know a little bit
about a lot of things...
Ugh, why did she
have to be such a bummer?
And why do you
have to be so negative?!
I'm not negative, I'm a realist.
There's a difference.
You're pessimistic.
Pessimism is just a
higher form of optimism.
If you expect nothing from people,
then you go through life
being pleasantly surprised.
Yeah, well, nobody
loves an albatross.
I'm going to get some coffee.
You want anything?
I do not.
Fine!
Hey, how's it going?
What can I get for you?
Um... ah...
I'll tell you what.
You take your time
and if you have any questions,
just let me know.
Doesn't a cyclops
always have one eye?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Um, I will have a large soy mocha
latte with a pump of caramel.
Good choice.
So, uh, how are things
going next door?
Uh... fine.
Can I speak frankly with you?
I mean, I know we don't know
each other that well but
I see you all the time
and we're all girls here.
This Sunday, my boyfriend is
taking me on a picnic to the bay
and I'm really excited.
I know it's going to be
super-romantic,
and I think that
I'm not letting myself
be fully excited
because there's something in our
relationship that's been bothering me,
which is that we've been
together for almost a year
and he still has not told me
that he loves me.
And I just need to talk
to somebody about it because
I don't want to ask him to tell me.
I mean, he said it on IM.
That's the thing,
he said it on IM.
Which my friend
says doesn't count.
It's like saying
"I love you" during sex.
It doesn't count.
And so I wonder if...
Where's your coffee?
They ran out.
Is that annoying girl still there?
Ugh. Yes.
What a fail-blog.
Epic.
Do you ever think about
when you dropped out of college
and wonder if you made
the right choice?
Every day.
Why do people have
such high expectations?
Everything happens
for a reason, Claire.
Nobody just ends up
at the Yankee Pedlar.
I guess.
You know what really
gets me though?
Hold that thought.
My eyes feel like they've
been doused in Tapatio.
I need to go upstairs.
What?
I'm sorry, I'm dead.
We can talk about your upcoming
quarter-life crisis tomorrow.
I just need to tap out right now.
Fine.
Leave your computer though.
What?
I'm not gonna hack the system.
I just wanna look up
a pair of high tops.
And it gets really boring when
there's nobody else at the hotel.
And my book sucks.
OK.
Just be careful with it.
Duh.
Oh and if you get the itch
to do any recording,
the recorder is charging
in the back office.
You remember how to use it you
just plug the microphone into the...
I know how to do it.
I get it.
Geez. I'd hate to be a ghost
in this hotel tonight.
Goodnight, Claire.
Good night, Luke.
Where is your website?
Wow, don't forget
to remind him about this.
Oh.
Tragedy.
Kinda creepy.
Whoa.
Shit.
How do you work this thing?
I don't wanna scare you but
I'm standing right behind you.
Fuck!
What the fuck??
Oh my God!
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me!
- What are you doing over here anyway?
- Crap!
I thought I heard a noise, dude!
Like what?
Banging.
Like a banging, man. Ugh!
- OK, well,
- God.
I woke up and
couldn't go back to sleep.
So we can switch now if you want.
Fuck!
Ok! God!
God!
Sorry.
Ugh!
Fuck!
My heart is pounding.
Do you know the story
of Madeline O'Malley?
She was the woman
that died here in the hotel.
She hung herself
after her fianc√©e stood her up
on their wedding day.
The original owners of the hotel
thought it would be bad press
and hurt the business.
So they hid her dead body
in the wood cellar for three days
before they could smuggle
her out on the loading bay.
When the people of the town
finally figured out
what had happened here,
they were outraged.
So the owners of the hotel
had to close it down
and were forced to sell it.
Nobody came through here
again until the sixties.
And, ever since then,
people have reported seeing
the ghost of Madeline O'Malley.
Roaming the hallways,
waiting for her lover.
Some say she's even looking
to take up a new one.
Excuse me?
What are you doing?
Mommy!
What's going on?
She said there's
a ghost in the hotel!
She says it's coming to get me!
I never said that!
What is the matter with you?
He's just a child.
Sweetie?
Sweetie.
It's OK.
It's not real.
Just a story, OK?
All right?
Come here.
I don't need this.
I have enough going on in my life.
Yes, ma'am.
You OK?
And you.
We still need towels.
I am tired of asking.
Don't make me the bad guy in this.
Right.
We're in room 225.
Yeah, I know which room you're in.
I work in the hotel.
Come on, sweetie.
It's a silly story, right?
You OK?
Ay yi yi.
Oh, I bought that cheap bread.
I can taste it.
Never skimp on bread.
You'll always regret it.
So, why do you think
she sticks around here?
Beats me.
Our rates aren't that cheap.
The Courtyard by Marriot
on Route 13 is much better.
No, not her.
I mean Madeline.
What do you think she wants?
I don't know.
I don't spend too much time trying
to figure out what women want.
Especially dead ones.
Please...
Well, when you saw her,
what did she look like?
Like, was she all dead-looking?
The thing about
physical encounters is
you don't really
remember the details.
It's weird because
you think you would but its like
she was there one minute
and gone the next.
It's almost like
she was never even there at all.
I don't know. It's hard to explain.
You kind of just had to be there.
God, I'm so jealous.
But if I saw her
I probably would've freaked out.
I can't believe you
never had your camera with you.
I know.
It kills me.
You down for some
recording tonight?
Mm... definitely.
We've gotta find some proof
that Madeline O'Malley exists
before this place closes down.
We have to.
Imagine how she feels,
being stuck here forever.
We gotta get something on tape.
It's like a moral imperative.
Eh!
Oh my God.
Ick!
Hi, Lee!
Shit!
How'd you get in there, bird?
Luke.
Luke, you are not going to believe
what just happened to me.
Luke?
What?
Uh... never mind.
I'm a pumpkin.
I'm gonna kill the snake.
Don't forget to record.
I left the list
for you on the desk.
OK.
Enjoy your internet porn.
This is EVP recording
of the laundry room.
Luke, I'm skipping this one.
There's nothing in here.
This is the EVP recording
of the banquet room.
I'm trying to contact the
spirit of Madeline O'Malley.
Madeline, if you can hear me,
please give us a sign.
Damnit, Luke, you said
this thing would be set up.
Luke!
Luke!
Luke, Come on!
Wake up!
Come on! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Luke!
Coming!
Jesus Christ.
What the eff?
Claire, I still have, like,
two hours left, man!
Dude!
You have to listen to this!
The piano was playing by itself!
I think it was her!
Come on, I'll be down at seven.
I'll listen to it then.
No!
No, I'm scared!
OK, come in.
Shit.
Uh... actually...
I'm... OK...
You sure?
Yeah, I think I just freaked
out for a minute but I'll...
I'll be fine.
OK.
Well, I'll be down
in a few hours, alright?
OK.
Do you mind keeping it down?
Do I have to ask you again?
You know what?
Just back off, OK?!
You're asking me what I "do"
the other day?
Well, I just recorded an
unexplainable phenomenon!
There is a ghost in this hotel
and I got it on tape
and it's a big deal!
So just...
Leave me alone!
Come with me for a moment.
Here, sit.
You need a drink.
Cheers.
You alright?
Mm-hmm.
Tell me about what you saw.
I...
Look.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I have a tendency
not to be a nice person.
I know that.
Please don't take it personally.
I don't apologize more than once.
Look, I can help you
with what you're looking for.
I just need to know what it is
that you're looking for.
I'm sorry.
Help me with... what?
Do you know what this is?
It's a pendulum.
It's used to answer life's
more... difficult questions.
Do you know why I'm here?
You're speaking at an
acting convention in Pottstown?
No.
I'm not here for acting.
I'm here as a guest
at a healers' gathering.
That's what I do now.
It's my true calling.
Claire, everything in
this world is connected.
Whether we understand that or not
depends on our sense of perception,
our willingness to communicate.
Now, you want to communicate
with the spirits in this hotel?
I can help you do that.
I just need to know what it is
that you want from them.
I don't know.
If they're real?
The... the ghosts?
Spirits.
There is no real
in this world, Claire.
It's all a state of being.
There are no beginnings.
There are no ends.
There are no ghosts.
We're each divine beings
that incorporate one energy
in the universe.
Like, uh...
Droplets of water in a vast ocean.
The universe has a plan for
each and every one of us.
Now, I want you to ignore what
your conscious mind tells you.
And open yourself up, OK?
What is it that you want
from these spirits?
I want to know if it was
Madeline O'Malley
playing the piano downstairs.
And if she really is
the spirit living in this hotel.
Hmm.
Ask again.
This time, close your eyes
and really concentrate.
Open yourself up.
Really ask it.
Ask it directly.
Are you the spirit
of Madeline O'Malley?
Did you die in this hotel?
Was that you playing the piano?
They won't say who they are.
They?
There are three of them.
What do they want?
Same thing you do.
What?
To live.
But they're not alive.
There was a terrible
tragedy in this hotel.
Something about the basement.
A mistake?
It's her.
It's Madeline.
That's where they hid her body.
You mustn't go down
into the basement.
Why?
Is that where she's trapped?
Is her spirit trapped in there?
You can't save her.
They tried to warn her.
They tried to help her.
Who's they?
What do they want?
What happened?
I lost contact.
Luke.
No towels.
Luke!
OK.
That's it, I've had enough.
We're going back to your dad.
OK?
Drink.
Don't worry about Gozer
and her demon seed leaving.
You actually did us a favor.
Claire, you're really
freaking me out.
You gotta pull it together.
You're way out
in the weeds right now.
It happened to me when I started
messing around with this stuff.
You really gotta be careful
about what's going on up here.
You start thinking you're seeing
things and it might never stop.
OK, fine.
The dream is one thing.
But what about the piano?
And what about
everything that Lee said?
I listened to the piano tape
and I don't know
what to tell you.
Maybe it's explainable.
Maybe it isn't.
But it's not worth
getting yourself worked up over.
None of this is.
As for the kook upstairs...
Look, Claire,
how many times have you seen
someone on late night TV
hawking their psychic wares
to an audience full of rubes?
Tons, right?
And how many times have you seen
a psychic in the newspaper,
solving crimes or
healing someone without medicine
or winning the lottery?
Almost never, right?
That's because it's all bullshit.
It's hocus-pocus.
That woman upstairs is just
an insecure old actress
and she's just trying
to stay relevant.
It's pathetic.
OK.
Don't you want to try to
figure out what's going on here?
Why aren't you more
intrigued by this?
I mean, this could be it.
This could be Madeline
trying to make contact
and you just don't even care.
Isn't this supposed
to be your deal?
I swear to God,
if that bitch is back with her kid...
Be cool.
Can I help you, sir?
Yes, I'd like a room
for the night, please.
OK, just one night?
Yes.
I'd like Room 353, please.
I'm sorry, sir, that room's
not available right now.
We only have rooms
available on the second floor
on account of this being
our last weekend open.
No.
I must have Room 353, please.
This is very important to me.
I came a long way.
Sir?
All the rooms on the third floor
have been stripped.
So if you don't mind
bringing up some sheets
and sleeping in a room
without furniture then...
I think we can help you out.
That would be fine.
OK, well, if I could just get a
credit card for the reservation.
I'll pay cash.
OK, we usually need a credit card
in case there are any damages.
Take this, please.
OK.
Let's go get you some sheets.
Some sheets...
Have a nice day.
That was very kind of you,
helping me out back there.
Oh, it's no problem.
I mean, I figured this whole place
is gonna be a parking lot anyway so
if somebody wants a certain room,
who am I to stop them?
It's really no big deal.
Sir?
Oh, thank you.
353 is where
I spent my honeymoon.
Oh.
This old place holds some
special memories for me.
It's interesting,
come back to a place
that feels like you never left.
Almost like you're right at home.
Don't you think?
I don't know.
Why don't we get you upstairs.
So, like we said, most of the rooms
have been cleaned and stripped
and most of the furniture
and linens are in storage.
But lucky for you the owner
was too cheap to hire real movers
so all of the beds are still here.
The room might not have
the same charm that you remember
but at least you won't be
sleeping on the floor.
That's alright.
I'm just here for
one last bit of nostalgia.
OK, well, here we are room 353.
The honeymoon suite.
And if you change your mind
and decide you want to move to a
room with a TV, just let us know.
That won't be necessary.
This is just what I came for.
Thank you so much.
OK, well, enjoy your stay.
If I'm gonna stay up
all night with you,
you're gonna get drunk with me.
Cheers.
How ya feeling?
Better.
Good.
Keep drinking.
It always helps.
Hi, Lee.
Hi.
How was your seminar?
Very good, thank you.
How are you two doing?
Not bad.
You want a beer?
No, thank you.
Really?
I heard you were a huge drinker.
Well, we all have our moments.
So, Lee, tell me...
How does it all work?
How does what work?
You know, being a psychic
and all that.
Well, uh...
Have you ever been
somewhere new
and sworn that you've
been there before?
Like d√©j√° vu.
Exactly.
Well, if you've ever experienced
what you call a d√©j√° vu
then you have the same
God-given ability I have.
In fact, we all do.
It's just that...
Well, sometime's my d√©j√° vu's
happen in another direction.
I can experience certain
feelings before they happen,
but it's not always clear
when or where they come from
so I have to be very careful in...
What I choose to share.
OK.
Well.
I'm really tired so I'm going
to go upstairs and go to sleep.
It's been a long day.
I'll come find you tomorrow
before you leave, Lee.
Don't let the spirits
keep you up all night.
Dude, you didn't need to say that.
That was really mean.
Oh, whatever.
You said it yourself.
She made you feel like an asshole.
Besides, everyone needs
a taste of their own medicine
once in a while.
You want another one?
Yeah.
Alright, you ready?
Yeah.
OK, this is Claire's haunted
reenactment, take one.
Interior.
The Yankee Pedophile.
Wha...
Was that the piano?
What?
Was it playing by itself?
It must be the ghost
of Madeline O'Malley
trying to tell me something.
Show yourself, spirit!
I say, show yourself, spirit!
There she is.
Poor, poor, Madeline O'Malley.
You think she's prettier than me?
Honestly?
Yeah.
She's a little homely
for my taste.
I think you're
much prettier, Claire.
Thank you.
That's nice of you to say.
In fact, Claire, I think you're
one of the prettiest girls I know.
Who are the others?
Uh... My mother,
my sister,
and that girl that
works at the Dairy Queen.
The one with the lazy eye?
I find laziness very attractive.
I really like you, Claire.
I really like you, too.
No, I mean it.
You're like the coolest person.
I just really feel like we mesh.
You know, I love the fact that
you support me with the website
and I just love the fact
that you take me seriously.
It means a lot.
You're great.
Even if I'm going
a little bit crazy?
You're not going crazy,
you're great.
I would do anything for you.
Really?
Absolutely.
Just...
I like you so much.
Hey.
I have an idea.
Me too.
What's yours?
Let's go to the basement
and find out what
that fucking ghost's problem is.
OK.
That's a good omen.
Turn the recorder on.
What was that?
I tripped.
Oh.
Eh.
Sorry.
It's just the light thing.
- Spider web.
- Follow me.
Follow me.
I'm starting to think we
should've bought breadcrumbs.
Hang on.
I hear something.
It's weird.
There was static.
I heard that too the other night.
Must be a bad cable.
No.
It's her.
This way.
This is it.
This is where they hid her body.
You ready?
We wish to speak to the spirit
of Madeline O'Malley.
If you are here with us,
give us a sign.
Make a noise
if you can hear us.
Why do you stay here, Madeline?
Why does your spirit never rest?
Whoa.
Madeline.
Give us a sign.
Did you feel that?
It's her.
That was wind.
No, she's with us right now.
Madeline, speak to us.
We wish you no harm.
Why do you stay here?
Why does your spirit never rest?
Wait! No!
Madeline. We know
that you're here right now.
Speak to us.
I can hear her.
Do you hear the whispering?
Madeline?
Holy shit.
What?
She's right behind you.
She's coming closer.
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
I gotta get out of here!
What?!
I don't want to be here any more.
I don't like this!
What are you talking about?
We just made physical contact!
Why are you freaking out?!
I just don't want
to be here any more!
That's it!
Why? Was it different than
the times you saw her?
There were no other times!
What?!
I made it up!
I never saw anything!
I made it all up.
I don't want anything
to do with this any more.
This is just too fucked up.
I gotta go.
Luke!
Luke, don't go!
I'm sorry, Claire!
You can't leave me here!
I'm really sorry.
What am I gonna do now?
Lee.
Lee!
Lee.
Lee! Lee!
Lee, wake up.
I need your help.
Help me.
Lee.
What are you doing in my room?
Get out of here!
No! No! Please!
Please! Please!
No, I will not you.
Please go away.
Come on!
Why should I help you?
So you can make
fun of me some more?
You know,
I believe in what I do.
And I don't believe in wasting
my time on lowly hotel employees
and their insulting ignorance.
Lee, I'm sorry, OK?
I should've defended you
downstairs,
I made a really big mistake, OK?
But I have a problem.
I'm scared and I'm alone,
Madeline made contact with me!
I don't know what else to do, OK?
I don't know what else to do!
Is there any more vodka
over there?
Let me check.
Yeah, I found this one.
OK.
Take me to where it happened.
Wait here.
Lee!
Was it Madeline?
Did you see her?
Lee, what happened?!
We must get out of this hotel.
You're in grave danger.
You can't stay here any longer.
What?!
I have to go get dressed.
Go get your things.
Trust me.
Oh no.
Lee!
I forgot something!
I'll meet you in the lobby!
Sir.
Sir?
Sir, I'm sorry
that I'm disturbing you
but there's been an emergency
and I have to leave
the hotel for a little bit.
Sir, can you hear me in there?
Sir?
Oh, shit!
Luke?!
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry I shouldn't have
left you like that.
- Please don't be mad at me!
- No, no, no!
- Listen, we need to get out of here right now!
- No, no, no, Claire,
I have to tell you something.
No! Listen to me, OK!
- Remember the old man upstairs?
- Yeah, yeah! So what?!
He's dead! He killed himself!
He's dead!
- What?
- Yeah!
He's dead!
Did you call the police?!
No!
Not yet!
And Lee said that it's not safe
to be here any more
and we have to leave right now
and I saw Madeline
- and she's trying to get me!
- OK, OK, wait a second!
Hold on, hold on!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here.
Jesus Christ.
Here, sit down.
It's alright.
His face.
There was blood everywhere.
It's OK.
Please, please, please
just get me out of here.
I don't want to be here any more.
Please.
Alright, OK.
Come on. Let's go.
- Lee! She's still upstairs!
- Where is she?
I don't know!
She's getting her things.
Alright, I'll go get her and
you just stay put for a second.
Are you gonna be alright
down here for a minute?
Yeah.
It's fine.
It's gonna be OK.
Just hold on.
Lee?
Is that you?
Lee?
Lee?
Lee?
I don't wanna
go back down there.
Are you down there?
Somebody help me!
Please!
Somebody help me!
Please!
Please help me!
Please! Please help!
No! Please!
Please! Please!
No! No!
Alright guys, hold it up
Hold it up.
God. Jesus.
Alright, get her out of here.
I was banging on the door
as hard as I could.
I could hear her screaming.
I was screaming for her to
open up but she wouldn't.
She called my name but I wasn't
strong enough to break it down.
This was at the
bottom of the stairs.
Alright, listen, I'm gonna
need you to come with us
and answer some questions
about the gentleman upstairs.
And help get in contact
with her family.
Can you do that?
- Yeah, I just gotta get my stuff.
- OK.
Think you tell the actress to
hurry up while you're in there?
We need her too.
Yeah.
Oh, listen, you sure you gave me
all the names and numbers
of the other guests?
Nobody you might be forgetting?
No, I gave you everything.
There was just that other woman
and her kid and Ron, the owner,
but he doesn't get back
from Barbados until tomorrow.
Alright, thanks.
What are you doing in here?
They're looking for you downstairs.
I said I'd find you.
We have to go
to the police station now
to answer more questions.
Did you hear me?
I said we have to go.
You knew this was
gonna happen didn't you?
You could've done something.
No.
There's nothing
anyone could've done.
They're looking
for you downstairs.
