<i>When you forge a weapon,
you need three things.</i>
<i>The right metal, temperatures
over 1,400 degrees,</i>
<i>and someone who wants to kill.</i>
<i>Here in Jungle Village, we got all three.</i>
<i><font face=Candara size=20 color=FF0000>{\an2}
<b>SubText: NoRMITA.326</b></font></i>
Bring out the weapons!
<i>Jungle Village, a heartless place.</i>
<i>Ruled by many savage clans.</i>
<i>Constantly at war.</i>
<i>Me, I'm just a blacksmith.</i>
<i>Minding my own business.</i>
<i>And biding my time.</i>
<i>I never wanted to make tools for killing,</i>
<i>but I made the sacrifice
for the woman I love.</i>
<i>Lady Silk.</i>
<i>She's a worker at the Pink Blossom,</i>
<i>and my only refuge in this hellhole.</i>
<i>Together, we had decided
to leave this place,</i>
<i>but it turns out that the universe
had other plans.</i>
<i>Fate twisted when Gold Lion,</i>
<i>the mighty leader of the Lion clan,</i>
<i>was summoned to the governor's palace.</i>
<i>The governor gave him a mission</i>
<i>that he was sending through Jungle Village
to his troops in the north.</i>
<i>Gold Lion accepted.
He gave his word.</i>
<i>But when it comes to money,</i>
<i>things get funny.</i>
Gold Lion! Gold Lion!
<i>Gold Lion was betrayed
by his own lieutenants,</i>
<i>Silver and Bronze.</i>
<i>Now, the only thing that stood
in their way was Zen Yi,</i>
<i>Gold Lion's favorite son.</i>
<i>But Zen Yi was about to get the news</i>
<i>that would forever change
all of our destinies.</i>
Chi Chi, I will never leave your side.
And I will return immediately home
to ask my father to arrange our marriage.
Zen Yi! Zen Yi! Zen Yi!
Chan.
I have terrible news from home.
It's your father.
You said you would never leave my side.
Master, the horses are ready.
If I don't avenge my father's death,
we'll never be safe.
Yah!
Hyah!
Brothers, I am truly humbled
to be your new leader.
Now, my lions, we must
keep Gold Lion's word
to protect the governor's gold.
Our enemies have surely heard
of Gold Lion's death,
and it is my belief that the Wolf clan, protectors of the west gate,
thinking we're vulnerable, will attack.
Instead of waiting, I say we strike
first and take them by surprise.
Brothers, should we not
wait for Zen Yi to return?
We will definitely need his strength.
I agree.
You agree?
Are we not the lions?
Hmm?
Are we not the strongest?
Huh?
Yes!
I say we move with power and strike now!
Put the fire out.
A dozen of these by tonight.
Three days.
Three days?
Why so long?
Hey! Never turn your back on a wolf.
Or it will bite you in the ass.
For the weapon that you desire,
it's going to take three days.
Unless you want some shit like that.
Two days or you're dead.
Hyah! Huh!
<i>The Chinese have a saying.</i>
<i>"Dangerous men will meet in our streets".</i>
<i>And so it was.</i>
<i>War raged between the clans,</i>
<i>and that meant pressure on
me to make more weapons.</i>
<i>And as word of the gold shipment spread,</i>
<i>strangers suddenly appeared
in Jungle Village.</i>
God bless you.
To my illness.
Cheers.
An English gent.
The gentlest.
Are you military?
How long did you spend in France?
Long enough to recognize
a man of refined tastes.
You've come to the right place
to rest your bones.
<i>Merci, madame,</i> but I'm not here for rest.
I should like a private room with a bath,
a view of the main road,
a bottle of that liquor,
and three of your finest.
Only three? Subtle.
Well, to start with.
I don't want to appear greedy.
Mmm.
A man with much chi.
Prepare the south suite for our guest.
Please, girls, the gentleman
has just arrived.
Give him a chance to
choose his own pleasures.
Hmm.
Yes, you.
And you.
And her.
Sir, I'm afraid she's with
another customer.
Yes, but it's the wrong customer.
"Journeys end with lovers meeting,"
"as every wise man's son doth know."
My dear,
you are about to suffer what no young lady
should have to endure.
Come.
I seek no quarrel with you,
my stout fellow.
I am merely trying to save this damsel
from what would be the most traumatic
experience of her young life.
If you'll excuse us.
It doesn't have to be that way.
It doesn't have to be that way at all.
Ooh.
My name is Mr. Knife!
You may call me Jack.
I have come to your fine village
for a vacation.
I do not wish to be disturbed!
My lady.
Shall I have the other half of crazy hippo
delivered to your suite?
Feed him to your dogs. It will make them
taste better.
I was worried about you.
Bring me some golden nectar.
Quickly.
Darling, what's wrong?
I'll be fine.
Those men are savages.
Why do you work yourself to death
for their sake?
I don't do it for them.
I do it for you.
<i>Another day, another dollar.</i>
<i>Lady Silk was happy, and we were
getting closer to our goal.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Zen Yi was getting
closer to Jungle Village.</i>
Poor X-Blade. No blades, just an "X".
You'll be joining your father
in hell today.
Who sent you?
Kiss my ring.
Long live Silver Lion. Hmm.
Mr. Ming is here.
We'll finish this later.
<i>The 10 rodents couldn't handle Zen Yi.</i>
Perhaps you should have sent 20.
The government shipment
is only days away.
Fifty-thousand taels of gold bullion.
Still, capturing it won't be easy.
It's being escorted by the Gemini killers.
If we hit the shipment
and the gold doesn't reach the northern
rendezvous point,
the government will send in their forces.
Exactly.
And to make matters worse,
the emperor's secret emissary has been
sent here to assist the troops.
And not even I know what he is capable of.
Or, for that matter, who he is.
Yes?
Compliments of the house.
How kind.
Is everything to your satisfaction?
So far, so good.
Shall I send up more girls?
What if I just cut these ones in half?
Mmm?
If you damage my girls,
I'll damage your boys.
Good God, that hurts.
In a very pleasurable way.
What if I put the baby's arm inside you?
Must be very good opium.
What are you looking at, dirty little man?
<i>Things were heating up in Jungle Village.</i>
<i>I was finishing the weapons
for the wolves,</i>
<i>while they were partying to a full moon.</i>
<i>Every dog has its night.</i>
<i>And Zen Yi, the X-Blade,
burning with vengeance,</i>
<i>was just one day away from our village.</i>
Sounds like company is approaching.
Smells like lions.
Zen Yi.
Brothers, what are you doing here?
We've come to escort you home.
Chan, tie their horses
and bring them drinks.
Yes, master.
Silver Lion is no longer the same.
He's changed.
Your father wanted peace.
Silver Lion wants war.
As I figured, a sheep in wolf's clothing.
No!
"No!"
The Gemini killers will arrive with
the governor's gold by sunrise.
Our plans are in place.
We're ready for them.
Good.
Well, that leaves one remaining issue.
Zen Yi.
Mr. Kwon, so pleased to see you.
Silver Lion.
Brass Body.
It's nice to see a familiar face.
"The Snake Charmer".
Your best work yet.
Thank you.
However, this next job
will not be so easy.
Is that so?
Zen Yi has become a thorn
in the lion's paw.
That's what happens when you
send mice to do a man's job.
You bring us another trophy,
I'll double it.
Zen Yi's blades will have no effect on me.
Should we go straight to base?
We'll post up at the Dragon Inn.
Wakey-wakey, little blossoms.
Wakey-wakey.
Go on.
Now, if you're good,
we can play a game called,
"Let's Pretend We're Catholic".
And I'll see if I can find the heretic
amongst you.
Let's start now.
Master Zen Yi.
My private room, please.
Of course. This way.
Chan, give this to Silver Lion.
And hurry back.
That should satisfy Madam Blossom.
She will no longer be your master.
No, she won't. Thank you.
Before we go.
Silver Lion should be here by now.
He knows we're here, and his tardiness
says more than his presence.
Stop, stop, stop, come back!
No!
Brother!
X-Blade,
you're a dead man.
Zen Yi.
<i>Well, Gold Lion was dead,</i>
<i>and Zen Yi was out of commission.</i>
<i>Now, it was all eyes on the Geminis,</i>
<i>who arrived in town with
the governor's gold.</i>
<i>Their plan was to post up at Dragon Inn,
spend the night,</i>
<i>and continue north.</i>
I've cleared everybody out,
just as you requested.
I'm looking forward to your famous
Cantonese braised ribs.
I knew you would ask.
It's already prepared.
Well?
Spicy.
Oh, good.
Upstairs.
You're still as lovely as ever.
Please.
Master Silver Lion.
I'm sorry, we're closed for the day.
Oh, you are never closed to the Lion clan.
Now, where are the Geminis?
Please, no trouble.
Trouble?
Mr. and Mrs. Gemini.
How are they?
Spicy.
Where's your boss, Gold Lion?
Unfortunately, he couldn't make it.
What do you want here, Silver Lion?
Oh, you know what we want.
Friends, there's really no need
for your journey to end here.
And by that, I mean your life journey.
You give us the gold, we spare you
and your men.
And maybe we will invite you to join us
and live like royalty
here in our lovely village.
A dog living in a palace is still a dog.
And every dog loves to chase the pussycat.
The Gemini stance.
Poison Dagger.
Where are you? Come out!
Come out!
Ah, no more, no more.
Go. We are closed.
Forever.
The lions do this. See what they did
to my inn!
You want lion? I cook you lion.
How would you like it?
Steamed? Deep fried?
Pan fried? Ah! Lion dumpling?
I was hoping for one last dish
of your Emperor Sui duck.
We haven't prepared that dish in years.
Seasoned with young basil,
and yangzi grains.
The dish is for very special customers.
Please.
What kind of lion is this?
Not lions. Gemini.
A very pretty one at that.
Such a shame.
Mercury.
The mark of Poison Dagger.
Who in this village would
have access to mercury?
Our blacksmith.
But he's not from here.
His weapons are very dangerous.
Well,
I'm only here for the duck.
<i>As if bad things couldn't get worse,</i>
<i>word got to the governor that
the Lions ambushed the gold.</i>
<i>This enraged him, and he called in
the fierce Jackal troops.</i>
<i>Now, these motherfuckers
had a Gatling gun</i>
<i>and more bullets than China had rice.</i>
<i>He gave them an order.</i>
<i>If one tael of gold was missing,</i>
<i>they was to burn Jungle Village
to the ground.</i>
Prepare these herbs.
Why are you helping me?
Because I forged the weapons
that killed your father.
I regret that.
Brother, don't avert your energy.
You're not strong yet.
No.
But soon.
And I want to ask you of one thing.
My blades, they were destroyed
by Brass Body.
I need a new suit of knives.
<i>The X-Blade's new suit of knives.</i>
<i>The final weapon these hands
would ever forge.</i>
<i>And if he can avenge his father
with these blades,</i>
<i>then my debt to him will be paid.</i>
<i>And I can grab my girl and get the fuck
out of Jungle Village.</i>
Come back to bed, Jackie.
Some pleasure before business?
You were business.
This is pleasure.
You've got good taste, blacksmith.
I always thought that Lady Silk
was the finest of all the girls.
And you've been monopolizing her.
Tell me where Zen Yi is,
or I promise you, you will
never see her again.
Oh, my. This is no way
to treat our guest.
Are we men, or are we beasts?
We are men!
So, my friend, I never got a chance to
thank you for your magnificent weapons.
They were invaluable.
So, it seems you've been working quite hard
these nights. I admire that.
But on what, may I ask?
Go to hell.
Listen, your skills can be used by us.
Hmm?
You can be a great asset.
If you give up Zen Yi and pledge
your allegiance to us,
your troubles will be over.
But, if you refuse, we'll make sure
you never work again.
You are no Gold Lion.
Well, that hurts.
I will ask you one last time.
Blackie, where is Zen Yi?
You shouldn't have done that.
Ooh.
What do you want to do with his body?
Leave him to the rats.
You're tough as old boots, blacksmith.
Englishman.
Who are you?
You can call me Jack.
I'm the one who saved you from the reaper.
Not my arms.
No. They're rat food, I'm afraid.
We're going to have to cauterize
your wounds.
It won't be pleasant. It won't be pleasant
at all.
Quite a sophisticated operation
you have here.
Drink.
I see you work with mercury.
Again.
One more. A large one.
Open your mouth, bite on this.
Take this, take this.
Your wounds are healing
surprisingly quickly.
How do you feel?
Am I assuming correctly
that you made this?
So, how does a man with your obvious skill
end up in a wretched corner
of the earth like this?
I spent most of my life in chains,
serving others.
The master of the plantation my family
worked on was dying of consumption.
For 35 years, my mother
served him, nursed him,
slept with him.
<i>And on his deathbed...</i>
Okay, now, what's his name?
Thaddeus.
Thaddeus...
Henry.
Smith.
Boy, good luck. You're gonna need it.
Momma...
Hyah!
Hey, boy, you got those horseshoes ready?
Didn't you hear? I asked if them shoes
were ready.
Nigger, you can't read.
So you don't know what
this fucking paper means.
It means nothing.
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Hey, man!
You're free now, huh, nigger?
Come and get it!
Come and get it.
Crawl, nigger, crawl.
Come on, kitty!
Yeah! Yeah!
Stay down.
Whoa!
Fidgety nigger, ain't he?
Go on, finish him off. Go on.
Nigger, you're gonna wish
you had never been born.
Jake!
The boat I escaped on sunk.
<i>Everyone was lost at sea.</i>
<i>But somehow...</i>
I strayed from the path,
and I paid the price.
The pendulum of karma swings both ways.
They made me a cripple.
But if you help me, I will forge
my greatest weapon ever.
As a young mind, we taught you that,
in the beginning,
there was the word.
<i>Yet when man failed to hear the word,</i>
<i>we were forced to teach by action.</i>
The chi in your body travels
through the 12 vessels
and builds up in your <i>dan tian.</i>
Your triple burners convert all particles
to energy.
By learning to regulate breath
and controlling your chi,
<i>a man is capable of amazing feats.</i>
<i>If one can find the source
to one's own energy,</i>
<i>he can transmit that energy</i>
<i>to activate inanimate objects.</i>
<i>You and the object become as one.</i>
<i>It becomes a slave to your will, your mind.</i>
<i>Your chi.</i>
What are you really here for?
Dear boy, gold.
So, how is your chi now?
Miss Silk, I'd like to thank you and
the blacksmith for your kindness.
The blacksmith, how is he?
The rumor is that he's dead.
Zen Yi.
My friend, you look pretty good.
For a dead man.
Thanks to him.
Care to join us for dinner?
I hope you don't mind your noodles
a touch on the spicy side.
This is an east Indian recipe.
Very hot.
And here's the secret.
Just a touch of butter.
Just a touch.
A spoon, dear boy. Baby steps.
Now, might I suggest, given the nature
of our common enemy,
and the numbers we're about to encounter,
that we come up with a plan?
In fact, our jungle wasn't
always an outpost.
Rumor has it, the fourth emperor
built a magnificent tomb for his queen
directly beneath our village.
Oh, that's fascinating.
Here. To good fortune.
Good fortune.
Now, when the captain of the Jackals
arrives with his many armed troops,
where do you suppose
he's going to attack?
Well, presumably the Lions' base.
Exactly, and he'll come not only for gold,
but also for lives.
We see the madam is well informed.
My sheets know every secret in this town.
Gentlemen, we've had dinner.
Now, dessert.
Oh.
Shall we?
The fourth emperor, a man of imagination.
And I thought lies were your
stock-in-trade.
Not stock. Just trade.
What do you have in mind?
You store your gold here, less
the 3% that goes to me,
along with the right to control my women,
my way, as I always have.
One way in, one way out?
Of course.
Three percent is quite steep.
Four percent.
My friend,
better 3% to the madam
than 100% to the Jackals.
Alright, we have a deal.
Now, we need a lot of action from
you coming from the south gate.
Try and make some noise.
We want the others to think
there's an attack.
I presume you're coming in from
the chopstick gate in the north here.
And I'll keep the southern gate locked up
until you get there.
How much time do we have
before the Jackals arrive?
Dawn.
If we don't get this done before then,
it'll be the end of the village.
They're moving the gold to the Blossom's.
I know a secret way.
Of course you do, little mouse.
Can you show us that secret way?
Change of plans.
Be careful, men. Sorry.
Not with the gold, but with your jewels.
This place is rigged with many traps
that will make women of you
if you don't respect them.
Rigged with traps?
Yes.
Oh.
You must tell.
Beautiful.
You may leave us now, madam.
And thank you.
Goodbye, madam.
She's quite lovely,
but partnership with this woman
is going to be an issue.
Don't worry.
In the morning, we will kill
all of these whores.
Oh, I can't wait.
So generous of your friend, the governor,
to bestow this great gift upon us.
You must never underestimate the power
of your enemy, Silver Lion.
You have a notable habit
of celebrating early.
Have your men begun trapping the Lion base
with the explosives?
Oh, yes. They should be nearly done by now.
When the mighty Jackals show up there
in the morning,
boom, boom, and bye-bye.
Stop it!
Lovelies.
Do not think for a moment
that I enjoy seeing you forced
into any position.
I have been exactly where you are.
The nature of power is that it belongs
to no one until it is taken, seized.
Seized through sex, violence.
Gold.
Men may have always held the power,
but power is a fickle mistress.
And here in Jungle Village,
the winds of change
are nearly upon us.
Now, back to work.
Dry off, prepare yourselves.
And we'll see who's left standing,
and who is on their knees.
Warriors.
Brave lions, kings of the jungle!
Drink up! Partake of the women.
Tonight, my friends, the Pink Blossom
is yours.
Oh, baby.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Aah!
Stupid bitch.
Black Widow.
Thaddeus.
This way! This way!
Mmm...
You thief, get out of here!
What was that?
I always take a gun to a knife fight.
Zen Yi.
Silver Lion.
Come and get me.
Jack Knife. I thought you were dead.
Reports of my demise were greatly
exaggerated, Dagger.
Well, then. There's business
to be done here.
Not this time, old chap. You see,
I'm on the other side.
Government emissary?
The emperor himself, no less.
Zen Yi.
Tiger style.
I thought your clan was extinct.
My clan is extinct.
I killed them.
I'm afraid you've come up a
little short, my friend.
Jack.
Unfortunately, Dagger, the gears of life
move inexorably in only one direction.
I'm glad to see you've adopted
the philosophies of my people.
Now get me out of here!
Dagger, Dagger, Dagger.
You should have finished
what you started.
That is the difference
between you and me!
I see my jobs through to the end.
The only difference between you and me
is the poison we use.
Opium?
It's not a poison.
It is a benefit and a solace
to the hardworking Chinese.
And the occasional Englishman.
I'll see you in hell.
I suppose you will.
Save me a spot by the fire.
I'm to your right.
I'm to your left.
What took you so long?
Got caught up looking at yourself
in the mirror?
Now you die, little brother.
Gold Lion raised you as a son.
Why would you betray us?
This was my time.
My time!
And this is my gold.
Well, here's your gold.
I'm gonna drill you like I drilled
your little whore.
By order of the emperor,
you have five seconds
to bring out the gold,
or we will kill you all.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Gentlemen!
Colonel Jack C. Wales,
emissary of the emperor.
Everything here is under control.
My friend, I've lost a father,
but I gained a brother.
Thaddeus.
Jack.
Thanks.
No, thank you.
I haven't had this much fun since
we protected the crown in Macau.
<i>The Chinese say,</i>
<i>"where there is iron, there is rust".</i>
<i>Well, not anymore.</i>
<i>Jungle Village was clean.</i>
<i>And I'm gonna make sure
that it stays that way.</i>
