is attracted to blood.

We're in Tucson, Arizona,
and we're here to investigate
a slaughter house,
a place where thousands
and thousands of animals
were brutally butchered.
And now, the question is, why is
there something evil here,
attacking
dozens of staff members
who are working
a haunted Halloween attraction?
♪♪
The Farmer John
Meat Packing plant
was built in 1962
and closed in 2004.
During its over
40 years of business,
it's been riddled
with stories of murder,
violent hauntings
and urban legends.
Its transformation into one
of the scariest haunted houses
in the nation seems to have
only intensified this sinister
and undeniable dark energy
that fills this warehouse
with chilling
paranormal activity.
♪♪
Here's the craziest thing ever.
We're in the first week
of November right now.
This whole month
of Halloween attraction
just closed last week,
and the owner says that that's
when the energy grows strongest
and the most attacks happen,
but it feeds off
of all those emotions.
So, it's gonna be charged up,
and we timed it
so that we would be
investigating it right now.
But not only that, later on,
we will be joined
by a very, very
good friend of mine.
His name is Post Malone,
an extremely talented musician
whose song "Rockstar"
held the number-one spot
on Billboard's Hot 100.
Post Malone is really
into the paranormal,
so when he gets here,
I'm gonna call him Ghost Malone.
Ghost Malone.
And he's been wanting to come
and join us on an investigation.
We got to give him
the initiation.
Oh, no!
He doesn't know
what the hell he's in for.
But we got business
to attend to right now.
There's a very
serious situation.
Guys, there's some urban legends
in here, as well,
about some children
that went missing,
the uncle said
to have murdered them
and their remains
ended up in the meat here.
It's an urban legend.
There's no facts
to support this.
However, it has been
handed down a lot.
As we make our way inside,
we start walking around
to find a location
to film our first interview when
suddenly, something affects me.
The owner?
-Oh, he's right here.
Do you mind if I ask you
a question real quick?
Absolutely.
You're just
walking us around.
I wanted to see the area, and as
I turned this corner here --
Wait, we weren't rolling
at that moment, were we?
Not at the first
right, though, no.
I just stopped
and I couldn't move.
Does anything happen
right here?
This whole room and the room
next to it,
kids won't even work for me
in these rooms anymore.
During the Halloween season,
they don't want to be
in these rooms,
especially not alone.
Have they been attacked
by things here?
Oh, absolutely -- scratched,
bruises coming out at no reason.
A lot of things
happen here.
Can you, uh, Billy, give me
a thermal EMF or something?
♪♪
Whoa, whoa.
Jesus.
You see that?
2.4.
Hey, guys, we just had a 2.4
spike in this exact area,
and now it's down to a 0.2.
We're just gonna go over here
to show you
that all of this
is not in service.
There is no electrical
in this machine.
Whatever caused the 2.4
milligauss spike
in this exact area moments ago,
has left,
and it means that that is
a transient energy mass.
Is that the energy that
affected me in this corner?
Yes.
[ Loud static pulses ]
[ Static stops ]
Whoa!
Whoa! Why did that just shut off
in your hands, dude?
All of a sudden, something turns
the Spirit Box off in my hands,
and as I turn it back on,
I receive a voice.
-I heard that.
-Did somebody do that?
[ Static continues ]
-Human?
-What?
That sounded like "human."
[ Static continues ]
BOTH: You're in trouble!
-I'm in trouble.
-You're in trouble.
They don't like it.
I don't think they like that.
It said I'm in trouble.
-Yeah.
-It said, "You're in trouble."
Why am I in trouble?
[ Static continues ]
What did I do?!
That was crazy.
Later, we will analyze these
two messages that came through,
using the same voice,
and we will make
a very disturbing connection.
Who is this strong,
aggressive spirit?
But first, we meet Rey,
who, while performing
at The Slaughter House
this year,
had an experience
that she will never forget.
There's three photographs
laying on this table.
I'd like you to hold up
the first one.
In this photo,
you can see Rey here.
We do not see
anything unexplained.
Let's pick up
this next photo.
This second photo, you can now
see an unexplained black mass
that has now entered
the frame.
You still are not feeling
anything at this point, correct?
-No.
-Okay.
In photo number three,
you can now see this black mass
that was entering the frame,
now touching your hand.
Did you feel threatened?
Did you feel anything
out of the ordinary?
When this was happening,
I felt like anger, tension.
It was like something --
I, like, felt something there.
It's like if someone
were staring at you
and you can, like,
feel them staring at you?
-Yeah.
-That's what I felt.
Did you feel it
on your hand?
I felt it, like,
at first, on my hand,
but it, like, went
throughout my whole body.
What did you feel
when you saw this photo?
As soon as I saw it,
I kind of like lost my breath
and I was just like
freaking out about it.
-This?
-Yes.
I, like, was flipping out
about, like, that
that was caught
on camera.
I believe that I may have
already came into contact
with what
is in this photo,
and the exact same thing
that you felt.
Thank you for
sharing this with us,
'cause this is
what I'm looking for.
Now I'm meeting with Aulora,
who requested
she be interviewed as far away
from the Boiler Room
as possible.
How are you doing?
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?
-No.
Why are you not okay?
Just knowing
what this is about.
Tell me
why it bothers you.
Is it things that
have happened to you?
Yeah.
I've been scratched
a couple of times.
Where does all
this take place mostly?
Mostly from down the hall,
in the Boiler Room.
The same room
where I got affected.
Do the scratches
draw blood?
Yeah.
Why would this entity
draw blood?
Could it be feeding off of it?
We meet Liz who has suffered
countless violent attacks.
You know
what's going on, right?
-Mm-hmm.
-There's an entity here.
Right.
It's following your staff home,
it's interfering with them.
-Yes.
-It's attacking you?
Yeah.
So, that appeared up here.
-What the heck?
It lasted like two weeks.
It's like a triangle.
Yeah.
Looks like
you got branded.
I have, right now.
-They're bruises.
-Yeah.
Did you feel this?
I didn't feel it
when it happened.
These puncture wounds that
you got, how did this happen?
I don't know.
So I had come in,
turned on the breakers
and I walked back out
and I looked down
and there was blood
dripping from my arm.
Okay, so, something
is drawing blood.
Right.
The entity here is strong,
dangerous and complex.
I want to pull the guys aside
and speak with them
before we move forward.
After talking
with these staff members,
this entity that appears to them
visually as
a black shadow figure
is following them home,
but, however, how many scratches
are happening here,
drawing blood?
We're just about --
-Wow.
I just got a stomach pain.
-You all right?
Something just like attacked my
stomach. Just kills, like --
Oh, my gosh.
I need to actually sit.
-You okay, Dakota?
-I don't know.
Have you ever had
that before?
Never.
That was really weird.

Somebody just
follow him in there
and just make sure
this isn't an attack.
When something
like that happens,
we have to follow up with it,
considering where we're at
and the level of attacks
that are happening
with everybody.
I wasn't attacked, but I felt
the pure rage of this.
And it's a concerning thing
for me and my entire crew.
And just speaking
with these staff members,
you can just tell,
the reactions from them,
that they're
terrified to be here.
♪♪
DAKOTA: I've never had a pain
right there.
ZAK:
I'm starting to think, you guys,
from the short time
that we're here,
we have experienced
pain with Dakota,
we are talking to people who are
being scratched, drawing blood,
I'm seeing photos
of puncture wounds --
unexplained puncture wounds.
When this place was
in operation,
it was just flowing
with gallons and gallons
and gallons of blood,
every single day,
thousands of animals
in pain and torture.
It attracts entities.
Just like a cut in the ocean
would draw
a blood-thirsty shark,
it is attracting
something here,
some type of entity
that does not have
the constant flow of blood
anymore from these animals.
So now, the people that are
occupying this Slaughter House,
it's drawing their blood.
Females is the only ones
it really affects.
The woman in trouble.
This is unsettling.
ZAK: At The Slaughter House
in Tucson, Arizona,
we're dealing with
a violent entity
who is drawing blood
and attacking staff members.
Now we sit down
with the owner, Bobby,
to analyze the amazing
evidence we captured
in the infamous
Boiler Room.
Okay, we want to show
you some audio
that we collected
in the Boiler Room.
Now, you were there when you
were just giving us a tour.
You weren't even meant
to be on camera,
and you saw
what happened to me.
Damn.
-You all right?
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.
We immediately started using the
electromagnetic field detector.
Mm-hmm.
And we documented
some unexplained,
really high spikes --
2.4 milligauss.
What I want you to listen
to are a couple voices,
because it means something,
from what I have observed
since I've been here,
and I'm gonna tell you what
that is after you hear them.
All right.
Now I'm gonna play
that last deep voice.
You can hear
his voice after --
Yeah, you definitely
can hear something.
Sounds like it's saying
"woman."
-Yeah.
-Woman.
So now,
go to the next voice.
Can you slow that down?
Yeah.
Trouble?
Well, if you listen,
it says<i> "in</i> trouble."
Listen.
This is the same voice.
So, you put those
together, "woman...
in trouble."
-Woman in trouble.
Huh.
And so, it just kind of
connects the dots, because...
Wow.
...for our
interviews tonight...
-Yeah.
-...I only interviewed women.
Females is the only one
it really affects
while they're here.
I felt anger,
there was a lot of tension.
I've been scratched
a couple of times.
I looked down and there was
blood dripping from my arm.
And it's just a coincidence
that the man's voice
that we got coming through says
"woman in trouble."
It doesn't sound
like a coincidence.
I have never put that together
that it's always females.
Can you tell me,
was there a female employee
that recently
lost her life?

She was our iconic actor
in the Boiler Room,

before the season started.

And she played the lead
in the Boiler Room?
She was Ginger --

of Boiler Room.
And it was devastating
to everybody here.

same types of attacks or any--

A cut across her arm.
So, she was getting marks
and stuff from something.

She even said she knew
something was in there,
some type of spirit.

After letting this
all settle in,
we have to turn our focus
into just our energy
as we prepare for
our special guest.
I have a good friend of mine.
He's been watching
"Ghost Adventures"
since he was
really young,
and we've been trying to
get him on an investigation,
and it just so happens
that this one worked out.
And he's not aware that
this one is very dangerous,
because it just attacked
a member of our crew, Dakota,
and what I went through,
as well, during our interviews.
So, our good friend that's
appearing on this investigation
is Post Malone.
What's going on, guys?
-Are you still nervous?
-I'm terrified, man.
Before we start,
I want to make you aware
of a couple things
that happened.
So, when we first arrived here,
we were just giving a tour
by Bob
to set up our first interview.
Then we started
using the Spirit Box.
We got the voice "Woman...
in trouble"
and it was those three words
that hit Bob the most,
because a woman was in trouble
in that same exact room
where we got that voice.
She just recently passed
in a car accident.
And she was the lead
in that area.
So, it hit him really hard,
'cause he started
connecting the dots.
All these other women
are getting attacked,
blood is being drawn
from their skin.
Something here, I believe,
is attracted to blood,
so we want to be
careful tonight, okay?
And your safety is
of my concern, okay?
But that's not gonna prevent me
from throwing you into the mix,
just as I would these guys.
I mean,
I signed up for this.
Yes, you did.

But, as we make our way
back to base camp,
Post sees a door
mysteriously close by itself.
I just watched
that door close.
No one's by there?
-No.

closed, like a very slow close.

"Did you guys open this door?"
But this door isn't, like...

opened earlier, anyways.
-Did you see any person?
-No.
-Close it.
-Unh-unh.

an X camera covering this door,
to see if we can capture
it moving on video,
and as he's setting it up,
he hears this.
I just want it to happen again
so you all know
that I'm not crazy.

[ Static pulsing ]
-It says, "Come."
-It says, "Come"?
-Oh, my God.
-It says, "Come."
-What'd it say?
-Come.
-Oh.
-Oh!
No.
You didn't hear that?
-No.
-What?
It sounded like, "Ohh!"
What happened?
Sounded like somebody dropped
something and said, "Ohh!"
That wasn't you.
You were right here.
-It wasn't me.
-It was here.
Did you just drop something?
ZAK: Because Post is hearing
disembodied spirit voices,
I give him the Spirit Box to see
if he is currently
an active conduit
and connected to these spirits.
[ Static pulsing ]
Post captures one of the longest
Spirit Box voices
we have ever heard.
Listen very closely as this
very distinct female voice
speaks three
separate times.
We can't be certain
of what she's saying,
but this is what
it sounds like to us.
I heard you.
It says, "Cattle."
-What?
-This thing says,
"Cattle" right now.
-Let me see that.
-It says, "Cattle."
It said, "Cow,"
and now it says "Cattle." Look.
I've never even heard it
say cattle before.
It says, "Cattle."
You see it?
-Hey, you know what, Zak?
-Ow!
Just felt like something
pinch me...
on my neck.
That's the way that we're
gonna attract this entity --
natural fear.
Is there anybody
up here with me?
Did you hear that?!
♪♪
ZAK: At The Slaughter House
in Arizona,
something seems to have
grabbed Post's neck.
Like right here.
Yeah.
It felt like someone pinched me
with their fingernails.
Did you just pinch me?
Did you just drop
something over there?
Oh, what did he say?
-"I did"!
-"I did."
-He said, "I did."
For the second time, Post Malone
gets touched on his neck,
and the spirit
takes credit for doing it.
This is insane.
Did you just pinch me?
Did you just drop
something over there?
...drop something
over there?
Oh, what did he say?
"I did"!
Even with Post
experiencing more physical
touching with
incredible evidence,
I can't help but be amused
by how he looks on
the thermal-imaging camera.
Post.
-What?
All right, we're gonna switch
things up here right now.
Because this entity
has been known to attack
multiple women --
scratches, bruises,
puncture wounds --
we're gonna send
Post in by himself.
'Cause I'm a woman.
No.
-Whoa. We didn't say anything.
-Yeah, I didn't say anything.
You just said,
"Just because he's attacking
women, we're gonna send..."
Yeah,
I wasn't insinuating.
I wasn't insinuating.
I guess it did sound bad.
And the reason why I'm doing it
is we got to use natural fear.
Let's go.
That's the way that we're gonna
attract this entity --
natural fear.
And I'm not saying that
you're gonna go up there
and be scared
and all that kind of stuff,
but I'm telling you, anybody
watching this right now,
to go inside this
40,000-square-foot
Slaughter House completely
by yourself with a walkie...
Give me a walkie check.
What are you gonna say?
Okay.
That's the go word for me
to come and get you.
Post will be investigating
the entire upstairs,
somewhere none of us
have ever been.
He is also wearing
a chest-mounted
full-spectrum camera.
How am I supposed to see?
-Ready? Right here.
-Yep.
-Just keep going.
-Okay.
See what happens.
Aaron, let's do it.

-Someone was just with me, dude.
-What?
ZAK: As we rush inside
to rescue Post,
Aaron becomes
affected by something,
possibly the same energy
that Post just felt
moving alongside of him.
AARON: My energy went somewhere
else for a little while.
And it's like, it's gonna
come back, but I --
It's weird, dude.
ZAK:
Are you around Aaron?
Gonna roll.
Rolling on the recorder.
Rolling, rolling,
rolling, rolling.
Why don't you appear
next to him?
Let us see you.
We conduct an EVP burst session,
and as we start
reviewing the audio,
Post reacts to something
that isn't on the recorder.
[ Gasps ]
Did you hear that?!
-No.
-What?
Did you --
You didn't hear that?
It was like this...
-Like where?
-Over here.
Oh, feel that.
Feel that! Feel that!
Oh, it's cold.
-Feel that?
-Yeah, it's very cold.
-It's very cold.
-Feel my arm.

you didn't hear that?
Dude.
Listen to that.
Did you hear it?
Shh!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Hello?
Shh!
What is that?
It's getting closer.
Hold on!
It's getting closer.
Me and Post just entered
into the actual Kill Room.
-Wait!
-What?
Whoa, whoa!
Go, go, go!
-What?
-I just heard breathing!

ZAK: Inside the Boiler Room
of The Slaughter House,
we hear a growl that seems to be
moving directly towards us.
Are you guys still
at base camp?
Yeah, I'm here
watching you guys.
It's not them.
It feels like --
-Yeah, I don't know why, man,
but I keep getting
flash images
of going to the other side
of the building.
I don't want to be last.
-Ready?
-Guys.
-Whoa, whoa!
-Go, go, go!
-What?
-I just heard breathing,
-like a hiss.
-Dude, I heard it.
-I heard it earlier.
-Did you hear that?
It was right behind me.
It was like this.
Yo, Zak.
-I don't want to be last.
-Ready?
-Guys.
-Ready?
-Guys.
-Ready?
-Guys.
Whoa, whoa!
Go, go, go!
Maybe it was trying to get us
out of the Boiler Room
when we did.
ZAK: We just want to know
about you, that's all.
POST: Whoo!
Dude, I see one.
I see...
-You see something? Look.
Oh, it's on him.
-It was just on you.
-Yeah, it was just on you.
At the same exact time, I just
heard something moving there.
ZAK: Post captures a small,
unexplained stick figure
standing on top of me,
and very soon after this,
something seems to overtake me.
What?
You okay?
You all right?
-Dude, what's wrong?
-He just zapped me, too.
You all right?
AARON:
I just turned around and he was
grabbing your shoulder.
You all right?
Yeah.
♪♪
ZAK: Whatever just appeared
on my shoulder
has affected me just as it did
with Aaron earlier.
Post even says that he feels a
shock of energy as I touch him.
I want this spirit to talk to me
and take credit
for what it's doing.
Since you're doing this to me,
can you say my name?
Whoa!
Did I just hear "Zak"?
BOTH:
It just said, "Zak."
Since you're doing this to me,
can you say my name?
-...name?
-Whoa!
Did I just hear "Zak"?
To end this out, Post and I are
gonna go, just him and myself.
Let's go try to find some areas
that we haven't been in yet,

more communication.

-Wait!

Oh, my God!
Did you touch him?
You didn't touch him?
He looks like
he was moving.
Are you serious?
Just a second ago, bro.
What's your name?
[ Static continues ]
What was that?
The only Spirit Box voice
that Post and I receive,
after using the Spirit Box
for over 30 minutes,
is a very clear, "Satan."
What's your name?
What was that?
Is it possible that
the overall haunting here
at The Slaughter House
is what I theorized
from the very beginning --
a mixture of human spirits
who have died here
and have not fully
crossed over...
Can you say my name?
Whoa!
...along with
the darker entities
who I believe were conjured here
through the blood
of slaughtered,
and who continue
to stay here, drawing blood
and affecting the living
who enter where the atmosphere
resembles that of Hell,
with their god...?
