I admit that.
I'm tired.
I'm weaker.
I'm losing my memory...
and I can't sleep.
Still, these friends of yours...
well, they're dead now.
I tore all three of them
to pieces...
and tossed the whole mess
off the cliffs out back.
Let the vultures
fight over what's left.
This is ridiculous.
I try to withdraw...
I retire...
I hide...
but still you find me out...
even in my dreams...
polluting my solitude...
filling the air itself with your
unending and pointless noise.
Go ahead, kill me!
Try it!
Try to be offended
by my mere existence...
you stupid fucking morons!
But don't send
these flattering lackeys...
with their cameras
and their tape recorders.
Callous and shortsighted
henchmen...
talking to me
like I was a goddamn child.
Shit!
The time it takes
to kill these idiots is...
it's depressing.
I can't go on like this.
If you won't come and kill me...
well, then
I'll have to kill you.
Every last one of you.
Yes. You win.
Or it shall be.
I am awake again and put upon.
And then, well...
Silence.
Unless...
Fuck!
Fuck off!
Newsroom. Please hold.
Margaret, that's
Associated Press on line five.
Thank you.
You're late.
I'm twenty minutes early.
Yeah, well, so what.
Here. Go make some coffee.
There's a world
of bad news out there...
ladies and gentlemen,
a world of bad news.
All we need to do is get
our hands on the worst of it...
the very worst news possible.
Fred, what do you got
on the national scene?
Federal government's
still on strike.
Old.
The nation's
already forgotten...
the government's on strike.
They're not impressed.
Has the president
shot himself yet?
Rumors are unsubstantiated.
Well, substantiate them.
Domestic terrorist activities
are up 60%%%...
in the past two weeks.
Interesting.
A little ahead
of the curve though...
isn't it, Tom?
How many dead?
Hundreds.
Sad, but not catastrophic.
Judy, what about international?
Genocide in eastern Europe.
Economic collapse in Japan.
The Middle East, of course.
Bootleg nuclear arms being sold
by the Russian mafia...
to both Pakistan and India.
Climatic irregularities
continue.
It's snowing in Johannesburg.
This is all last week's news.
It's filler.
Random facts to pad out
the end of a show.
What do we have here in town?
What's happening
down at city hall?
The mayor has sold
lower Manhattan...
to a major Hollywood studio.
OK. Sure.
That will fill air time till
at least tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe by then the president will
have done something drastic.
Have there been protests?
Violent demonstrations
in all five boroughs.
OK. Cop an attitude about it...
but not one
we can't change tomorrow.
Come down hard on the mayor.
Careful, Boss.
Same Hollywood studio
owns this television network.
So stupid!
Why?
Sorry.
What is it, Beatrice?
A clue has surfaced...
as to the disappearance
of our TV crew in Iceland.
What TV crew?
We sent them there
two months ago...
to investigate the legend
of a monster said to exist...
beneath an abandoned
U.S. missile silo...
near an isolated
northern village.
The local authorities searched
for them but found nothing.
What turned up?
A tape from the sound recordist.
One of our envelopes. Look.
What's on it?
Someone claiming
to have killed them.
Killed who?
Our crew.
Really?
Tell me more, Beatrice.
The cameraman was my fiance.
Really?
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Nevertheless, I think
we should follow this up.
This has got potential.
We need to do
these human interest pieces...
from time to time.
Can it be me?
Can what be you?
Can I be the one
to go investigate...
the disappearance
of the TV crew?
You?
God, Beatrice, I mean,
who'll make the coffee
in the morning?
I went to college.
I studied journalism.
Look, you're very young.
This could be dangerous.
Three young men have gone
missing out there already.
Think of your family.
I don't have a family.
My mom died last year...
and she was all that I had
in that way...besides Jim.
Jim?
My fiance.
I see. Sorry.
Please.
''Dear Jim.
''It was real difficult
to get a taxi to the airport...
''because some terrorists
had threatened to blow up...
''the bridges leading
out of Manhattan.''
''So I tried to take the subway.
''But a religious group had set
off nerve gas on the train...
''and we were evacuated
before I even got ten blocks.
''Luckily, I was given a ride
by two guys in a truck.
''They were demolition experts...
''and said they weren't afraid
of terrorists...
''religious people, or anybody.
''They seemed happy
and relaxed...
''and looked forward each day
to destroying things...
''for a living.''
''Waiting on line
at the airport...
''I saw two men get caught
trying to smuggle...
''radioactive materials
out of the country.
''It's like my mom used to say--
''the world's a dangerous
and uncertain place.
''A few moments here and there
of selflessness and affection...
''are about as good
as life gets.''
I'm sorry, Miss,
but your flight's been rerouted.
You'll have to fly
to Brussels first...
and make a connecting flight
to Lisbon.
And from Lisbon...
pending further notice...
you'll be able to fly directly
to Reykjavik, Iceland.
Thank you.
Thank you.
''I wish you could've
known my mom, Jim.
''She would've thought
the world of you.''
Scott Andrews,
please dial extension 3326.
''Still...
''I can't stop writing
these letters to you.
''It keeps you alive somehow.''
You need help, don't you?
Final boarding
for flight 167 to Brussels.
Passengers traveling
on flight 167 to Brussels...
please proceed
to gate 9A immediately.
Please have your boarding card
and passport ready.
Once again, final boarding
for flight one--
You've got to hurry up, miss.
They're holding the plane
for you.
Go.
So what happened?
Airliner crashed
into the Atlantic last night.
The boss wants an expose on
the air by 6:00 this evening.
Did anyone survive?
I doubt it.
Come on, Judy.
It's got to be somebody's fault.
What's the airline saying?
They're withholding comment
pending further investigation.
Fred, I want the names
of everybody on that flight.
And I want a camera crew
in the home of every parent...
child, and relative you can get
your hands on by lunch time.
Margaret, if you start crying,
you're fired.
She was on that flight.
Pull yourself together,
Margaret.
This plane was headed
to Brussels.
-We sent Beatrice to--where?
-Iceland.
Iceland. Yes, of course.
We sent Beatrice to Iceland.
It was rerouted.
Why didn't we know that?
Yes, I speak English.
Yes. Potemkin.
Coordinate 45-72 west...
38-50 north.
Yes. Have located survivor.
Request assistance now.
What is it?
They found someone.
She's sustained
multiple fractures...
three broken ribs,
severe concussion.
Both her legs are broken.
She has much internal bleeding,
extreme hypothermia...
and severe damage to the spine.
It's a miracle she survived.
Jack, yeah, it's me.
Listen, regarding
the Beatrice situation...
They say she'll be OK in time.
She might not walk again,
though.
I'm sure we're gonna have
an exclusive on the whole thing.
She's worked with me forever.
I can't remember.
A long time. How long?
-Five months.
-For five months. Really?
Well, anyway, you know,
she's just a kid.
Yeah, she's pretty.
Pretty enough, anyhow.
You know, plain,
well-adjusted...
optimistic,
completely out of touch.
She'll do whatever we want.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
The world needs to know.
-Why?
-What?
Why does the world
need to know...
what it was like
to crash into the sea?
Prevention.
They need to know...
all they can
to prevent another crash.
I already told the people
from the government...
investigation team
everything I can remember.
Technically, yes,
but what about the experience?
What about the sensations,
the drama?
Who were the cowards?
Who was brave?
The children,
what were the children doing?
OK. We can talk more later.
They were people.
They were actual people.
All right.
Have it your own way.
You're on your own now, though.
You've got no one
in this world, Beatrice.
Remember that.
A few weeks from now,
this is all gonna blow over...
and nobody anywhere
is gonna give a damn...
about the poor lonesome
survivor of flight 167...
and, for instance,
her accumulating medical bills.
Just trying to help you out.
Thank you.
Beatrice, do you realize how
rare an occurrence this is...
how phenomenally slim
the chances are of anyone...
surviving a jumbo jet
crashing into the sea?
You're a celebrity.
You're a media darling.
You're an institution
just waiting to happen...
a phenomenon.
It's no use.
We're going home.
Is it possible?
The operation has only been
performed once before.
The pain and the effort
of the surgery itself...
will kill her.
It's not impossible.
Will it hurt?
Yes, it will hurt.
A lot?
Yes, it will hurt very much.
Good morning, Beatrice.
Are you comfortable?
I think so.
Can you understand me clearly?
Good.
Beatrice, in this procedure...
we are going to need you
to be as alert...
and as communicative
as possible.
We need you to help us.
Do you understand me?
Good.
During the first few hours
of the operation...
we will be administering
a series of local anesthetics...
at different parts
of your body...
calculated to wear off...
as we proceed from one part
of the operation to the next.
We know the parts of your body
you have no sensation in...
as well as those you do.
As we go on...
you will begin feeling
more and more.
And if we are having
some success...
we will reach the final stages
of the operation...
in which no anesthesia
can be used...
but at which time you will begin
feeling more and more...
of the work we are doing.
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?
OK, then...let's begin.
One, and stand by.
Program formatted.
One, and stand by.
Local anesthesia one.
Thirty-nine.
Anesthesia three...
and pause.
Thirty-nine.
Local anesthesia three.
Pause...
and lock.
Thirty-seven...and pause.
Thirty-seven.
Confirmed.
And ready.
Wait.
Now.
I think it's time for me to go.
What will you do?
I have to go look for Jim.
I have to find out
what happened.
Your friends rented a car to
take them as far as Bordheyri.
Beyond there,
it's no use having a car.
They said they would return
in a week.
They did not return.
Finally, after about a month...
the police contacted me
about one of my cars...
which had been abandoned
in that place.
Dr. Anna, do you believe
in monsters?
A little.
Even you? A doctor?
A doctor sees
all sorts of things...
that are hard to explain.
Our job is to try to explain
them, but sometimes we can't.
Maybe that's what people mean
when they talk about miracles.
Like you, for example.
I was just lucky.
Or blessed.
He says they left the car
at the garage...
and hired a guide to take them
by horseback to Heimsenda.
That's the village.
It's not possible
to drive to Heimsenda.
There are no roads.
She says...even the horses
will only go so far.
I'll be OK.
I know you will.
Where are we?
These stones, they keep
the evil thing in the north.
Who lives in the village?
Only those who have to.
What kind of people are they?
You'll see.
He was standing right there...
so close that he could
feel the monster's breath...
singeing the hair on his arms.
And he breathed fire at him,
and his feet went up in flames.
He raised the house
up off its foundation...
and then he tore the door...
off its hinges.
She says the monster has woken,
and he's angry...
and our offerings of whiskey
are not enough.
We tried to tell your boyfriend
and his crew to stay here...
and to leave the monster
in peace...
but he wouldn't listen.
The Americans...
tried to build a missile base
out on the monster's rock.
I was a boy. I remember.
We tried to warn them, but they
wouldn't listen either.
I was a child, yes.
I remember.
You could hear their screams
for miles.
You could smell their blood
on the wind.
Will you take me there?
We will take you just so far.
No further.
She says that you should spend
the night with us...first.
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?
Where am I?
Where are my clothes?
How did I get here?
Every once in a while, those
maniacs down in the village...
toss an unsuspecting
piece of ass...
up on the rocks down there.
A gift, I guess, for me.
What have you done
with my friends?
I killed them, probably.
I don't believe you.
So what?
Are you going to kill me, too?
That depends.
On what?
On whether or not you're
a complete fuckin' idiot.
What's wrong with you?
What do you mean,
what's wrong with me?
Why are you like that?
Because I'm a monster.
There's no such thing
as monsters.
I'm sure there's
all sorts of reasons...
why you are the way you are.
Genetic mutations,
that sort of thing.
Science.
Are you a scientist?
No. I have a friend
who's a doctor.
How did you do that?
How the hell
am I supposed to know?
Now listen, sister, you gonna
help me out here or what?
Help you?
What can I do to help you?
I don't even think I like you.
Yeah? Well, tough.
You're either
gonna help me out here...
or I'm gonna come down there,
bite your head off...
tear your heart out, and set
the whole ugly mess on fire.
You don't scare me.
-What's your name?
-Beatrice.
Listen, Beatrice.
You'd like to see me dead,
wouldn't you?
Not necessarily, no.
Of course you would.
I killed your friends.
If that's true, then I think
you ought to be brought...
to justice and punished so
you can learn to understand...
the wrong you've done.
The wrong I've done?
Yes. It's like my mother
used to say.
Jesus had it all figured out
right and proper.
One evil deed
doesn't fix another.
You've gotta learn
to love your enemies, too.
Jesus.
I can see this
is gonna be a disaster.
Look, I'm gonna close my eyes,
and you run away.
If you're not off the island
by the time I count 1,500...
I'm gonna come,
and I'll kill you.
Did you really kill Jim
and his friends?
Who the fuck is Jim?
My fiance.
That's his video camera
over there.
This is his PowerBook.
Come with me.
Where?
Just shut the fuck up
and follow me, will ya?
So do you believe
in monsters yet?
Leave me alone.
I'd love to, sister, but you
gotta pull yourself together...
and help destroy me first.
What do you mean?
That's the deal.
You come here and try
and help kill me...
and if you can't,
I get to dispose...
of one more
pain in the ass human being.
What the fuck is that?
It's loaded.
Of course.
OK, princess.
Take your best shot.
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.
No, I can't.
Do it!
I'm not impressed by mercy.
You don't score points with me
for bein' selfless, Beatrice.
Your life means nothin'
to me at all.
Get over it
and see the big picture.
You're just
another human being.
Just another piece
of the plague, so to speak.
I'd kill you just as easily
as I'd kill a fly.
There would be no remorse...
no pangs of conscience...
no fascinating sensation
of diabolic accomplishment.
It's nothin' personal.
You're just in my way.
I see extinction...
in everything else around me.
The passing away.
Even the mountains pass away.
It's true. They do.
I've watched it happen.
But not me. No.
I'm changeless and eternal.
It's true.
I'm an alcoholic...
and an insomniac, too,
but then...who wouldn't be?
Doomed to endure humanity's
victory over all things...
without even the option of
killing myself like they do...
and for much smaller
disappointments, too...
in my opinion.
You're a kind person.
I can see that.
I don't know what good
it's gonna do you, but...
I believe you have
the presence of mind to see...
the impossibility
of my situation.
You want to be put out
of your misery.
Don't pity me!
I hate that shit!
Are there others like you?
Are you sure?
You must get lonely.
There...
there is a human being
who can kill me.
He used to live in the house
out there near the water.
Dr. Artaud. A scientist.
Mad as the day is long,
but a genius all the same.
Where is he now?
He got to shootin'
his mouth off...
about his new invention,
and the next thing you know...
they took him away
in a straitjacket.
You see...
Dr. Artaud...
he believes in monsters.
So you want me to find him,
is that it?
You will be doing
you and your kind...
the greatest of favors.
It can't go on
like this forever.
If I don't find Artaud soon,
well, then, I'll be forced...
to go on a rampage and kill
every human being I see.
Find him yourself.
I can't!
I get these fits!
What causes them?
People. Humanity. Civilization.
I don't know.
The more people there are,
the worse it gets...
and it's gettin' worse
by the year.
Drinkin' helps.
What makes you think
I'll be able to find him?
'Cause you made it here alive.
Because you made it
all the way here...
without me tearing off
your goddamn head.
I'm impressed, OK?
What do you want from me?
Promise me something.
Promises.
How you human beings
love promises.
You can't kill anybody.
If nobody comes around,
I won't kill them.
It's easy.
But I want you to come with me.
Where?
To find Dr. Artaud.
You mean out there?
I can't go out there and be
expected not to kill anybody.
Then I won't help you.
You're making this a lot more
difficult than it needs to be.
Maybe.
You promised.
Are we connected yet?
It's ringing.
Beatrice,
what's happening out there?
A monster? A real monster?
This isn't some sort of
flash in the pan freak is it?
Right.
Artaud. Dr. Artaud.
But listen.
I want an exclusive on this.
Let us handle everything, OK?
Right.
We'll find
this Artaud character.
If we can't find him,
no one can.
But listen, I'm gonna need
some interviews...
a press conference maybe,
certainly a photo spread.
Are you ready for that?
OK. Now hold on tight...
because this is going
to be very, very big.
I think we're gonna be famous.
Good morning, Miss Beatrice.
How was your flight?
I'll show you to your room.
Hello, Carlo.
Right this way.
I'm Carlo.
This is my friend.
All these people,
they're my friends.
Hey, get out of here, friend.
Beatrice, what are you doing?
We've got a press conference
in forty-five minutes.
-Who's this?
-This is Carlo.
-Fred, get him outta here.
-Bye, Carlo.
Come on.
What time is it?
It's early, but we've gotta
strike while the iron is hot.
Margaret,
where is that makeup girl?
-Wardrobe people are here.
-Great. You know the drill.
Cute, but sexy.
Maybe some sunglasses.
God, Beatrice.
What were you doing all night?
I was making love.
Aloha.
You must be...
well, the monster, I guess.
You killed our TV crew,
did you?
Tore them to pieces and threw
their limbs to the vultures.
-I heard all about it.
-Where's Dr. Artaud?
We haven't found him yet.
Shit.
I can see this thing's goin'
from bad to worse already.
It's rumored he was abducted
by the U.S. Government...
for research on top secret
weapons development.
Wait. Listen.
Do you hear that?
Exactly.
Easy, gentlemen.
Matter is one.
Remember that.
The bar, of course.
Is that him?
U.S. Federal Marshal with
ward of the state Dr. Artaud.
Margaret,
sign for the delivery.
Thank you, gentlemen.
How are you, Doctor?
How was your trip?
My God.
I can see right through you.
Fritz, show me
to the swimming pool.
No, wait. The patient.
He's upstairs.
I must talk to him at once.
Follow me.
No, not yet. We have
the press conference first.
-Will there be food?
-Of course.
In that case, Fritz.
-Who is Fritz today?
-You are.
Right. Yes, doctor?
My notebook.
Get him out of here.
But...
But nothing.
If that asshole upstairs
is a real monster...
I want him kept alive for
as long as he's fashionable.
Move.
Hey, you. You in there?
Go away.
I want to talk to you.
Holy fuck.
Will you leave me alone?
Look, I want to apologize.
Apologize for what?
Listen, princess...
you've just begun
to make my life a living hell.
Look, I just feel awful
about last night, you know?
All the noise we made,
all the dancing and singing...
and then...
good lord.
The sex for hours
and hours and...
You were over here
all by yourself.
The only creature
of your kind known to exist.
That was terribly
inconsiderate of me.
I apologize.
OK. It's time to go.
Beatrice,
why the publicity stunt?
Beatrice, does the monster
obey your every command?
Is it true
that a new line of cosmetics...
is to feature
your name and likeness?
Beatrice, are you
and the monster lovers?
What's he really like beneath
that tough-guy exterior?
Have you ever seen him
kill anyone?
I have a question
for the monster.
Let's get right down
to the main issue here.
A monster in this day and age?
I mean, don't you just
find that, like, irrelevant?
He breathes fire. I saw it.
He can't be killed
with bullets, either.
Come on.
I remember...
when you were young.
Pond scum.
Just another ooze on the edge
of the local warm water.
I was there watching.
I saw you evolve.
Bored to tears,
I sighed and waited...
as it took you millennia
to turn into fish.
Cheering you on...
jumping up and down,
throwing rocks at you...
as you crawled stupidly
up onto the sand.
Pathetic.
I used to sneak down into your
little villages at night...
and grab some old person
or a child...
and I'd crack
their skulls open on a rock.
Then I'd look...
study...
try and figure out
how you work.
What made you morons
so damned adaptable?
But there was nothing.
Blood, guts, and shit,
same as everything else.
Pointless, absurd.
Just another fucking accident.
I used to stand
on the cliffs at night...
and howl at the stars, wondering
what would become of me.
Was I gonna live forever?
I want to die, but I can't.
I'm indestructible.
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.
It must be yours.
I know of no god
who could be that cruel.
I know of no god...
unless, of course, I am God...
but then what difference
would that make?
I'd still be fucked.
Round and round,
the same old dead end.
Reasoning, logic.
Bored, finally, I'd...
run down the mountain
and terrorize the villagers.
That was just excellent.
Thank you very much.
Piss off, lady.
Where's Dr. Artaud?
These gentlemen
are waiting to take you...
to Dr. Artaud straight away.
Fred, where are they
taking him?
He's on his way to Dr. Artaud.
Hey, watch it!
Where's Dr. Artaud?
I want to see the doctor!
Dr. Artaud's not far off.
Please be patient.
-Where's the girl?
-What girl?
-Oh, the girl.
-There's a girl?
Yes, of course there's a girl.
Get that goddamn thing
away from me.
And who do you gotta sleep with
around here, anyway...
to get a fuckin' drink?
Matter is one.
Yes, of course. That's easy.
But, you see,
are different densities.
Heavy and light.
It can interpenetrate.
-You see, it's proved.
-This proves it?
You doubt my methods.
It's OK.
The center needs a margin.
Have some wine.
Are you a scientist
or something?
I'm on vacation--
or lost, maybe.
We have to wait and see.
It's beautiful.
It is both an equation
and an architectural schematic.
To know and to be.
This is not even a question.
There is no alternative.
You see, it's clear in
the loneliest little avenues...
between particles and waves...
shunned even by
the gregarious quark...
unheard of by the various
strands of time.
So large it cannot be seen...
yet small enough
to be immovable...
lies the fabric
of infinite reality...
gripped in the tiny
little concrete fist...
of the all or nothing.
What do you call it?
The matter eradicator...
invented to free
a difficult friend...
from eternal damnation.
You must be Dr. Artaud.
For what it's worth,
alas, my name is mud.
They keep me locked in a room
on the top floor...
but I said rude things
to the chambermaid...
and she set me free.
I thought you were examining
the monster.
Not yet. I've been left alone
with my thoughts.
It is not so bad, really.
Come on.
We have to get out of here.
They've tricked us.
I'm so sorry.
Margaret, where is he?
It's so sad.
It's all over the news.
This beast,
that has killed thousands...
upon thousands remorselessly
for hundreds of years...
is now subjected to intense
scientific experimentation...
aimed at discovering
his exact subcellular makeup.
Government researchers all
agree this freak of nature...
is as yet indestructible...
impervious even
to atomic radiation.
Sources close to the president
claim the monster...
is an invaluable strategic
defense acquisition.
Remarkable.
He's beyond
scientific analysis.
He's an unknown substance.
He's everything and nothing.
Professor,
he has to be something.
Of course, but that something is
something we cannot name yet...
so we must not believe
it exists.
But he is weaker
than we thought.
He cannot stand information.
He's like an enormous
satellite dish.
He feels passing
physioelectronic...
transmissions the way you
and I would feel the ache...
of a brain tumor.
He won't die, will he?
Oh, no. Quite impossible.
I assure you
he's perfectly indestructible.
He can withstand this torture
indefinitely.
I only hope that
I will be able to procure...
the appropriate funding
to continue my research.
We can help you with that.
I would appreciate
anything you could do.
We have to get him out
into the world, though.
But he's dangerous.
Yes, of course.
But he's made a promise
to Beatrice.
A promise to a young girl.
What is it worth?
We'll have to wait and see.
Still, to let him at large
and study him...
under a multitude
of circumstances...
this could be
extremely valuable.
My guess is people
will be bored by the monster...
sometime tomorrow afternoon.
It takes a lot more
than the supernatural...
to captivate the imagination
of the demographic...
I have to deal with, Professor.
He'll fall from fashion.
He'll fall hard,
and he'll fall fast.
He'll be ridiculed and abused.
This will make for very
interesting observations.
Everything's set with the ship.
Be there at 6 a.m.
And ask for Vladimir.
Your flight leaves at 10:30.
You'll be met by friends of mine
at the airport in Iceland.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Don't talk to anyone.
Take care.
Kennedy Airport.
International departures,
please.
Good. Very good.
It's just the right mix
of pathetic and scary.
It's just a matter of time
before he breaks his promise...
and tears some punk to pieces.
Can we let that happen?
Look, we're not the police.
This is news.
We produce news.
Please hold.
Line two.
Beat it.
He's missing.
What have you done with him?
We haven't done anything
with him.
The girl showed up
and took him away.
Calm down. In the real world,
we call that drama.
We've got it all
here on tape.
It's fantastic.
Don't worry.
Dr. Artaud is gone, too.
-What?
-The Army has taken over.
I have been fired.
The shit has hit the fan, lady,
and it's all your fault.
Artaud.
There you are.
-What's that supposed to mean?
-He's gone.
I know he's gone.
What happened?
He was spirited away
by the ingenue.
Go find Margaret.
There's quite a hefty bar tab
to be dealt with as well.
What is this?
Margaret kidnapped Artaud.
They hold me responsible.
It's a crisis situation.
The monster is gone as well,
and Washington is afraid...
someone else might get
their hands on him first--
not to mention Artaud.
The Chinese have already
broken off diplomatic relations.
The Pentagon's declared
a worldwide manhunt.
Special Forces
have been mobilized.
The United Nations
Security Council...
is meeting at noon.
Boss, don't worry.
It'll be all right.
-We'll call the network.
-They'll threaten somebody.
No. Don't you see?
This is perfect.
God, why didn't I
think of this before?
The monster, Beatrice--
they're old news.
This is just the twist
I've been looking for.
Sort of demonization
of the media type of thing.
Don't worry. Get to work.
Keep me informed.
Gentlemen, I'm ready.
Take me away.
Yeah, me...
whose voice in the wilderness...
caused the birds
to fall dead from the trees.
It was anger alone...
that could turn the water
at my feet suddenly ice.
Humanity shouldn't wait around
for an apology from me.
Nope. Not the human beings,
blindest of the blind.
The doers of all undoing.
The poison ivy of the universe.
The diaper rash of reality.
You noisy dumb bastards.
Listen. Come on,
pull yourself together.
I'm tired.
I want to go to sleep.
So go to sleep.
See what I care.
I need you to keep a lookout.
The cook keeps trying
to bother me.
About what?
You know.
What are you thinking about?
Nobody's scared of me anymore.
I'm scared of you.
I am.
They're coming!
But what will the world
be like without monsters?
This monster is ourselves,
our hope and our fear.
We created it, and it killed us
in our sleep...
and we saw that we were human.
It does not remember
its beginning...
because it began with us.
We formed him with a history.
We're so cruel, I think.
Not that we kill him, but that
we put this responsibility...
on his ugly shoulders
in the first place.
He did not ask for it.
We're so good at this.
We talk things into reality...
to convince ourselves
that we exist.
And now the most
vicious blow of all--
to kill a creature
by proving to him...
that he's a figment
of our own imagination.
Three minutes and counting
to eradication of matter.
My friend,
we meet again at last.
Is it true, Artaud?
Will it really work?
I think so.
-It's never been tried.
-But the numbers all add up.
We had to improvise.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
Two minutes and counting
to eradication of matter.
He'll never know
what happened to him.
Beatrice, come away.
You can't be here.
One minute and counting...
to eradication of matter.
Beatrice, please?
