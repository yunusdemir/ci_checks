Gabriel Wyath, 26.
Engineering student...
diagnosed about five years ago.
Delusions began to grow
increasingly vivid and violent,
eventually requiring
hospitalization.
Gabe has successfully
masked his issues for so long
that by the time
that anyone was aware
of the extent of his problems,
his delusions had convinced him
to try and blow up
a government building.
So what are we looking for
when we make a diagnosis
of schizophrenia?
Steph?
Well, many patients
<i>develop a routine</i>
<i>to help them maintain</i>
<i>the illusion of control.</i>
Double Americano.
Extra shot. Skim milk.
Extra hot. Thanks.
Black coffee?
<i>Despite this, they</i>
<i>outwardly exhibit disorganized</i>
<i>or odd behavior.</i>
I don't think
that's what I ordered.
<i>Which can lead to confusion</i>
and agitation.
Where did you put
the Alderman file?
Who the hell is Alderman?
See?
Right where I said it was.
<i>They might suffer from</i>
<i>coexisting sleep disorders,</i>
<i>including insomnia.</i>
The majority of cases
become unstable
without medication.
Good.
The issue lies in what happens
when a patient
refuses treatment.
<i>Many will endure</i>
<i>confusion, anger</i>
and risk harm to themselves
and others,
<i>all in an effort</i>
<i>to cling to things</i>
<i>that only they see</i>
The delusions that drive them
also convince them
to try to hide the depth
of their problems.
Our challenge is to...
try to find a way
<i>to help someone</i>
<i>who doesn't want it.</i>
<i>The risk lies in...</i>
<i>the damage</i>
<i>they can do if we fail.</i>
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>
<i>I'm awake with my wife,</i>
<i>and I close me eyes,</i>
<i>I open them...</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>
And this has been happening
since the accident?
<i>So you began</i>
<i>working on one case</i>
<i>here in reality,</i>
<i>and then suddenly</i>
you begin working another case
<i>there, in your dream.</i>
<i>It all feels</i>
<i>completely real to me.</i>
<i>You can't tell</i>
<i>whether you're awake or asleep</i>
at this very moment?
<i>Well I can assure</i>
<i>you, Detective Britten,</i>
this is not a dream.
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.
AWAKE

<i>Hey, Dad, the school says they don't
have the permission slip.</i>
You told me you turned it in.
How am I not the account holder
if my name is on the bill?
N-No, don't put me...
I gave it to the teacher,
the guy with the...
thing on his head...
I'll call him.
You can't call.
They had to be
cleared last week.
And I'm sorry, I'll take you
to museum myself... how's that?
It's not about the museum.
It's about the fact that
now I have to spend
the day in study hall
because you didn't turn in a
simple piece of paper.
I'm telling you,
I'm pretty sure I gave...
the guy something, unless
I gave him the phone bill.
Well, no, no, no.
I'm talking to my son.
Don't, don't...
Listen, how could it
take you three days
to switch the service back on
when you have my money today?
Hold on a second.
Yeah?
I'm on my way.
Hello?
Hello?
All right.
You ready to go?
I told you yesterday,
Cole's dad is taking me.
- I'll text you when I'm out.
- No, you won't.
Your phone's not gonna
be on for three days.
What?!
It's gonna be back on
on Wednesday.
The phone company
messed up. I'm sorry.
Uh, Vega.
Those prints come back?
You asking me, Detective?
Mike, glad you could make it.
Len's waiting on us;
The prints came back.
Really?
They originally made it
for the astronauts.
I'm telling you, I sleep
like the dead in this thing.
I'm not spending half my
pension on a mattress.
Half?
We're talking about
an astronaut bed, man.
I'm pretty sure I spent
my whole pension
and probably a little of yours.
What?
Well, first of all,
there's coffee in it.
Look, Len...
I dropped the thing, okay?
- No. There's also a ring missing.
- What?
Yeah, there's one...
two-fingered brass knuckle ring,
with the word "WILD"
inscribed on the top.
Look. No, no, no, no.
See, I picked everything up
and put it all back in here.
I made sure.
This is why I tell them
not to let you guys take it
out of the property room.
Do me a favor... it's
a ten-cent knockoff.
It's got nothing to
do with the crime.
Could you do some...
Lenny magic, make it disappear?
Just don't do it again. Okay?
- I owe you a large beer, my friend.
- Y-You owe me a ring.
Never should've got
out of bed this morning.
You know, I had
that same feeling,
but it's 'cause
I was very comfortable.
That astronaut bed... ooh.
- Oh, come on.
- Whoa.
I wasn't the one who was
too tired last night.
Ouch.
Just eight minutes of
your precious time.
Eight minutes? It takes me eight minutes
to get these clothes <i>on.</i>
Six.
No. You're going the wrong direction.
How about 12 minutes
and a police escort?
And that is my final offer.
How about lunch?
- Lunch?
- Yeah.
Sure.
All right.
But tomorrow we stay
in bed all day. Deal?
Deal.
There was totally a sign there,
and you blew right through it.
There was no sign.
- Let's go back.
- I'm eating.
Because you know
it was a stop sign.
No.
When we get to the station,
I'm gonna write you a ticket.
All units, Code 3.
Possible hostage situation.
Vista Psychiatric Hospital.
11347 Vista Heights.
Seven William 43 and 45,
responding Code 3.
Come on. It's okay. Come.
What's up?
Guy claims to have the whole
place wired with explosives.
He's got himself
barricaded in there
with about 15 other patients,
doctors and nurses.
We've set up a perimeter and
already started evacuation.
This is the head
nurse in charge.
He is a patient.
His name's, uh, Gabriel Wyath.
He just started screaming he was
gonna blow the whole place up,
and then he locked down the
high-risk wing from the inside.
You see these explosives?
They look real to you?
He's got a bunch
of acetylene tanks
with wires sticking
out of them.
Detective,
- he's on the phone.
- Who?
The patient.
He wants to talk to
whoever's in charge.
You're the senior officer.
This is Detective Britten.
Who am I talking to?
It's Gabe. Okay. It's Gabe.
You have to stop the noises.
Stop the sirens. Okay?
I can't hear my thoughts and I need
to hear what I'm thinking or...
Okay, Gabe.
Hold on a second.
I'll see what I can do.
Let's have all units
respond Code 2.
Seven William 45,
have all units respond Code 2.
Hold on a second, Gabe.
All right. How's that?
Gabe, is that any better?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you. N-Now,
which one are you?
Raise your hand.
That's me.
Right here.
You got me?
I see you.
You look okay.
Thanks.
All right, Gabe, listen.
Here's what I need you to do:
I need you to let all those people
you're holding walk out of here.
No! No!
Don't, don't... Hold on.
I tell you what I need. Okay?
That's how this works. Okay?
- That's how it works! Okay?
- All right.
All right, Gabe. I'm sorry.
So, what do you need?
I need you
to bring me my sister.
Okay? I know they have her.
I know all about it. Okay?
I-I just need to see her...
talk to her. Okay?
I-I just need to...
to see her.
All right, Gabe.
Give me a little time and...
Gabe?
What did he say?
He wants to see his sister.
Christy.
- You know where I can find her?
- You can't.
She was murdered about
four years ago.
Great.
We estimate
there are 25 hostages.
He's got them locked behind
these sally port doors, here.
Ah, here we go.
Everyone, this is Dr. Lee.
He's worked with the
patient extensively.
We're just trying to get a thumbnail
of what we're dealing with here.
Well, what we're dealing with
is a very intelligent
and very troubled individual.
Gabe...
was actually a rising star
in a government research lab
when his condition started
to become apparent.
He lived with his
sister, Christy,
until four years ago
when she was murdered
in a dispute with an ex-boyfriend.
Gabe responded to her death
by creating an elaborate
conspiracy theory in which
his sister was not murdered,
but abducted by agents from the
lab where he used to work.
Despite our best
efforts, he's...
he's grown increasingly
delusional.
Doctor, bottom line:
Is this a guy we're gonna
be able to reason with?
As long as he's allowing
his actions to be dictated
by things only he sees or hears,
it's unlikely.
Very well.
This is a high security
building.
Apparently, Gabe has
overtaken the command room.
So, he can use all the measures
designed to keep the patients in
to keep us out.
Realistically,
we're looking at 12 to 14
hours to try a full breach.
Our only immediate option
is to try sniping him
through the small western
window.
But if we're gonna
get a clean shot,
we're gonna have to maneuver him
into position.
The negotiator's trying
to work out a trade
to get one of our guys inside.
See if we can't...
- direct him.
- He won't let anyone out,
but he's agreed
to let someone in
that can help him
find his sister.
- We can work with that.
- There's one complication.
He's saying he will
only take the officer
who helped him with the noise.
- Detective Britten.
- Absolutely not.
How else are you
gonna take the shot?
Once you're in,
ease him toward the west side
of the drinking fountain.
That's where we've
got the best shot.
Excuse me.
Hey, honey.
Hey, babe.
<i>I know you're gonna think I'm crazy;</i>
<i>What if we try that
Lebanese place again?</i>
No, I can't.
Oh, I know, but they say
that the lamb's gotten
so much better.
No, no, I mean,
a situation came up at work.
I... I got to take a rain check.
Oh.
Okay, well, what about dinner?
<i>Dinner would be great.</i>
Hey.
You know that I love you, right?
Yeah, I love you, too, babe.
I'll see you tonight, all right?
See ya.
<i>Not have been evacuated,</i>
<i>which all over a dozen people that
remain inside this building.</i>
<i>Apparently, one officer
has been admitted in</i>
<i>and is attempting
to reason with Wyath.</i>
<i>No comment.</i>
<i>We don't know
what his demands are.</i>
<i>No stranger though, this man,
to this sort of violence,</i>
<i>Wyath was arrested in late 2008</i>
<i>when he entered
a municipal building</i>
<i>with explosives
strapped to his body.</i>
<i>Shortly after this,
he was transferred</i>
<i>to the high-security wing
of this facility...</i>
<i>This is
Detective Michael Britten.</i>
<i>Please leave me a message,</i>
<i>and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.</i>
Vega.
Efram...
y-you're not at this hospital
scene I'm watching on TV, right?
Okay, listen to me...
Where is he?
Where's-where's-where's Michael?
We had a situation,
and he didn't want you to worry.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Sh-Show me you're clean.
I got nothing on me, Gabe.
Just like you told me.
Okay?
So let's stay calm.
Just sit down.
What did they tell you?
They told me to come in here
and help you find your sister
and bring her to see you.
Did they tell you
that I'm making it up?
Because that's
how they dismiss you.
How they try to get rid of you.
Yeah, they did.
I'm not imagining things.
My sister is real,
and she's alive,
and whatever they told you,
she doesn't deserve this.
She's the only one
that ever understood.
When they tried to
split us up, take me away
because they said
that I was sick,
that I wanted to hurt people,
she wouldn't let them.
She fought them, and instead
of letting them haul me off
to a place like this...
she took me to one like this.
She looks nice.
She protected me.
I let them take her.
I should have protected her.
And I didn't.
But now I need,
I need to get her.
I need to get her back.
And that, that's what
makes me sick?
Don't you think I would be crazy
if I <i>wasn't</i> trying to save her?
Yes.
Look.
Look at this.
No! No, no, no! No!
No!
Okay. They think that I
can't see through this?
I mean, but it's
practically obvious.
Gabe,
can I ask you something?
What is that in your hand?
I know you're there!
This?
Yeah.
This is a dead man's switch.
It's what triggers the bombs,
Detective.
I let go...
boom.
It's how I'm gonna
keep them honest.
As long as I don't let go,
everything's fine.
But if they try something...
No!
No!
Excuse me.
This is how we'll find her?
This map?
That's where Dr. Wilde has her.
Dr. Wilde?
Two-fingered brass knuckle ring
with the word "WILD"
inscribed on the top.
He's holding her.
He's got her in this secret
underground location.
They think that she's gonna
talk about my research,
but I keep telling them
that she doesn't know anything.
But they won't even admit
that they have her.
How can you reason with someone
when-when they say that
she's not even alive?
Right.
Will you shut up!
I'm trying to tell him
where Christy is!
Shut up!
Please.
Shut up!
Shut up!
- I said, shut up!
- No! No! No!
No!
Get away from the window!
Sierra One,
I have visual on suspect.
You got a
green light on the shot.
Shut up!
Let go!
No, Gabe.
Calm down.
You tried to kill me!
No, no, I'm trying to help you!
The switch...
I can pull the wire
from the transceiver,
and it's the same thing
as letting go of the button!
- Don't-don't do any...
- Do you want me to do that?!
- No, no, no. Okay, I'm not touching it.
- Let go!
Get away!
Shh-shh-shh.
Stand up!
All right,
let's just calm down, okay?
Gabe?
Turn around!
Okay.
I need you to stay calm, Gabe.
If we're gonna
try and help you...
Shut up!
I can't think!
I can't have you causing
this kind of trouble.
All right, let's just slow
everything down, okay, Gabe?
Gabe!
Let us out of here!
Gabe! Gabe!
No!
Come over here and talk to me!
Gabe, don't!
That'll kill him!
Gabe, don't do it!
No, Gabe!
Hey, it's me.
That missing ring turn up?
The one that said "WILD"?
Sorry.
Your dad didn't notice
you carrying two bowls?
I don't think he would have
noticed if I'd had two heads.
He's acting weird lately.
Why?
Why? I don't know.
You don't ask?
It's none of my business.
Sure it is.
He could be getting fired.
Or, I don't know,
he has a tumor.
Or he could have
an eating disorder.
He doesn't have
an eating disorder.
No?
How would you know
if you don't ask?
We just... don't talk
about stuff like that.
Would you know if your parents
had an eating disorder?
Mm-hmm.
Totally.
We practically tell
each other everything.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Where do they think
you slept last night?
In your bed.
You're serious.
Yeah.
They practice
progressive parenting.
As long as I tell them
the truth, they trust me.
They must want to kill me.
No.
They'd be more mad at
you if they found out
you were giving me this.
A lot of processed sugar.
So you're allowed to sleep over
at your boyfriend's,
but you can't have
Cap'n Crunch?
Progressive parenting.
See if the cleaning crew
found the ring, will you?
No need.
Guy pled guilty this morning.
Case closed.
Really? You sure?
<i>Yeah. He took 18 months.</i>
After that, well, I'm sure
he'll be a model citizen.
There's something wrong there.
We got to find the ring.
Need to find it? Why?
I mean, you said yourself
it's not important
to the case, okay?
We got enough real work here.
I don't need you
out there hunting,
looking around
for cheap jewelry.
Now, if you feel bad,
you can send the guy
a carton of cigarettes.
Look, can you ask them
to keep looking?
Okay, look, I'll ask 'em,
all right?
Mike, you still there?
Yeah.
So when you coming in?
No, I, I got to stop
and see someone first.
<i>Tell me about psychiatric</i>
<i>drugs, the kind you inject.</i>
Something that might
cause hallucinations.
An anesthetic like ketamine,
for instance,
could have that effect. Why?
The last thing I remember
before I woke up this morning,
I got shot up with something...
maybe ketamine.
I don't understand how...
There's this guy,
a mental patient,
he's taken some people hostage
in a hospital,
and I was sent in
to diffuse the situation.
He attacked me and injected me
with something, and-and...
You mean in your dreams.
I don't know what's
going on now.
Are you experiencing
hallucinations?
No.
This ring that you're missing,
you said that it wasn't
important to the case,
and yet you feel compelled
to find it. Why?
The guy's looking
for a after a Dr. Wilde,
and the ring's got "WILD"
inscribed on it.
I see.
And this psychiatric patient,
what exactly is the nature
of his illness?
He's a schizophrenic.
Would you say that you're
frightened of him?
He's got the building
wired to explode,
and I'm inside it, so...
you know,
so I'm a little bit frightened.
What if I told you that that
sounded like a positive step?
I'd say that's
not exactly how it feels.
Through this missing ring,
you have linked yourself
with a schizophrenic,
a man who's unable to distinguish
fantasy from reality.
But in this situation you've created,
your own well-being depends
on neutralizing him,
on defeating him.
And on some level, that means
that you've acknowledged
the danger presented when
someone refuses to see things
for what they are.
You're saying I'm dreaming to
tell myself to stop dreaming?
I'm saying, right now,
it's a missing ring,
<i>it's a permission slip,</i>
<i>it's a phone bill.</i>
But what you're really afraid of
is what all that might point to.
You're having a nightmare about
madness, Detective Britten,
<i>because somewhere inside,</i>
<i>you fear that if you continue to
deny the reality of your situation,</i>
<i>this is where</i>
<i>all that could end.</i>
What are you doing?
Hey.
Hey, you see a ring
around the house?
Like, a two-finger gold thing
with the word "WILD"
written across the top?
No. Why?
It's evidence; I got to find it.
Um, I'll let you know
if I see anything.
Hey, Rex! Get down here!
Come here.
Did you take the ring?
Hey, I asked you a question.
Did you take the ring?
I, I...
I didn't think
anyone would notice.
It's evidence
in a murder trial, son.
You can go to jail.
I could lose my job.
I figured it wasn't important.
And that's a good enough
reason to steal?
I wanted to give it
to my girlfriend.
Your what?
She likes that kind of stuff,
and I can totally get it back.
What girlfriend?
You don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah, I do.
Since when?
Um, I don't know.
A few months.
No. You would
have told me.
You told me about the last one.
The-the, the blonde one.
I didn't. Mom did.
Right.
I know since she died,
you want us to suddenly be,
like, all cool, whatever.
But you're,
you're still my dad.
What does that mean?
I don't know. We just...
We just don't talk
about stuff like that.
So you were gonna, what, send me
a wedding invitation?
Look, your mother's not here.
We don't have...
your interpreter any more.
It's just you and me.
And if we want
to make this work,
we're gonna have to put
some effort in.
I'm-I'm doing my best.
You got to do it, too.
Okay?
So, tell me something
about her.
She got a name?
Emma.
Emma.
She worth stealing for,
this Emma?
I'm sorry.
I'm supposed to see her tonight.
If you want
to get the ring back,
you could, you know...
meet her.
Is it wrong that I still think
it's romantic?
Yeah... a little bit.
But he's gonna get
you something
he has to actually
pay for, right?
Yes.
You kids still wear
those big clocks, right?
I like him!
Why haven't I met him before?
Yeah, Rex, why not?
I don't know.
All right, that's enough
torture for one night.
You're not staying?
Uh, no. I got what I came for.
It's nice to meet you, Emma.
It's nice to meet you.
Okay.
Sorry, that's the way
we do it in my family.
It's just, Rex and I are still
at the, the high-five stage,
but we're working on it.
Just wait till you get home?
Dr. Lee, what are you
doing in here?
They convinced Gabe
to let me in.
You got a pretty big dose
of ketamine.
You'll probably feel
the residual effects
until it wears off.
You'll stabilize in a
couple of hours. Easy.
How is he? What's he doing?
Well, he's been...
What?
What's going on?!
What are they doing?!
<i>Yeah, they're coming in.</i>
They cut the power off.
Means he can't control
the doors or cameras.
Who turned off
the lights, huh?!
Turn the lights on!
Turn them on!
Turn the lights on!
What does that mean?
It means SWAT's trying
to find a way
to come in here...
and shoot a man who's wired
to explode.
Why won't they
just bring her to me?
Gabe, I need you to let me
to make a phone call
or they're gonna come in here.
I won't let that happen.
I can still stop them.
Please?
Look, you want answers
to your questions, don't you?
If they come in here
and everybody dies,
then you don't get
any questions answered.
So, please,
let me make a call.
Vega.
Tell SWAT to stand down.
Gabe has a dead man's switch.
- Tell SWAT.
- Stop! Stop!
Let's break 'cause the guy's
got a dead man's trigger.
We shoot him,
the whole place goes up.
Stand down. Stand down.
<i>Everyone hold your position</i>.
For now.
Okay, they're holding.
What do we do?
I-I need you to look
into a couple of things.
Gabe says his sister's
being held by a Dr. Wilde.
Is there anything on file?
Dr. Wilde?
<i>I don't know. I'll check.</i>
And see what you can
dig up on a trip
he took with his sister
just before she died.
Trip? To where?
<i>To a beach or something.</i>
Okay. Thank you.
All right, I'll see if
I can find anything,
and I'll get back to you.
It's gonna take a little time.
You know,
sometimes I see her.
Here, in my room or...
she'll just be beside me
walking down the hall.
I know she's not...
I-I know she's not
really here,
but it just feels so good
to be around her again.
Uh... they keep saying
that-that I... see things
that aren't there.
But that's not my problem.
You know what my problem is?
No matter how hard I try,
eventually,
I stop seeing things
that aren't there.
That's why I had to do this.
I don't want to imagine
seeing Christy any more.
I want it to be real.
All right?
Yeah?
I've got no reference
to Dr. Wilde anywhere.
Not in the lab where he worked,
<i>not where he went to school,</i>
<i>no one he's ever seen
for treatment, nothing.</i>
<i>The only reference to Wilde
in the file at all</i>
is the Wild Rose Cemetery
where Gabe's sister is buried.
He's holding her.
He's got her in this...
secret underground location.
I also don't have anything
about a trip in '07.
<i>All the records say
that at that point,</i>
<i>he was in pretty heavy therapy
and afraid to travel.</i>
All right.
Um, keep looking.
They're getting somewhere.
Just need
a little bit more time.
Okay?
Doesn't make sense.
What?
Vega says
there's no way this guy
took a trip in '07.
Maybe that's not
what it refers to.
Maybe.
Did he find out anything
more about Dr. Wilde?
No, Wilde's not the name
of a doctor
holding Christy underground,
it's the name of the cemetery
where she's buried.
There's got to be
something here.
Detective Britten,
this is a huge step.
Hmm?
The fact that he's
taken this detail
and put it into his narrative,
it demonstrates that,
on some level,
he remembers burying Christy
in that cemetery.
On some level, he
knows that she's dead.
If guided properly, we can
help him to understand
that there is no sister
to bring to him.
We can end this standoff.
You want me to tell him
his sister is dead?
Isn't that exactly what
you've been doing for years?
It's different this time.
It's not you telling him,
it's him telling you.
These glimpses
of-of a healthy mind
buried under layers of
delusion and denial are rare.
It's up to us to
properly seize them,
to guide him.
I don't know.
I don't think...
Hey.
What are you talking about?
All right, look, Gabe...
I wasn't completely honest
with you before.
I do have information
about Christy.
Do you know where she is?
Since your wife's funeral.
There's no world in which
your son survived the accident.
She escaped.
Nobody was meant to know,
because this place they were
holding her underground
was meant to be inescapable.
Honestly, they thought
it was impossible.
But she did it.
Christy got out.
She beat them,
Gabe.
And-and she managed to leave
a message for you.
And Dr. Wilde, of course,
was trying to keep
the whole thing a secret.
What did she say?
She wanted you to know
that she was okay,
that she was free and happy,
and she was never gonna let
anyone catch her again.
And she promised
that someday, someplace,
you will see her again.
The last line just read...
"I love you, Trip."
Oh!
She's okay.
Yeah.
She's okay.
Oh!
<i>How did you know</i>
<i>his sister called him Trip?</i>
<i>I didn't.</i>
<i>I saw it on the picture,</i>
<i>and his name was</i>
Gabriel Wyath III, so I figured
<i>I'd give it a shot.</i>
I don't understand.
Trip. As in triple.
Nickname for third.
So you had the opportunity to
help this patient see the truth,
<i>but you chose instead</i>
<i>to perpetuate</i>
his denial. Why?
How would he be better off,
<i>thinking of his sister</i>
<i>in the ground somewhere</i>
than-than thinking of her free,
<i>liberated, waiting for him?</i>
<i>Explain to me what exactly</i>
is so great about seeing reality
for what it is?
You've more or less summed up
the reason why
every major religion has
some version of an afterlife.
<i>You built a story about the</i>
<i>costs of living with fantasies,</i>
and you allowed it
to point you back to
all the things that get lost
in the shuffle
between these worlds,
<i>like this relationship</i>
<i>of your son's.</i>
<i>But when you came</i>
face-to-face
with the larger revelations,
you backed down.
You retreated into
a-a scenario where
<i>you save the day,</i>
<i>you play the hero,</i>
<i>win the affection of the wife</i>
<i>you've feared losing,</i>
<i>and the approval</i>
<i>of the therapist</i>
<i>who's expressed doubts in you.</i>
Just like Gabe,
you hold the keys
that will tell you
what's real and what's not.
<i>But for the moment,</i>
<i>you're unwilling to turn them.</i>
What's that?
Hey.
Oh, my God, I remember this.
You and Mom used to read this
to me, like, every night.
For years.
Gabe didn't need to be forced
into some kind of revelation
for his story to turn out okay,
so why are you so
eager to do it to me?
Detective Britten,
you are comparing yourself
to a schizophrenic
whose delusions led him
to be institutionalized.
I'd strongly prefer
if we find a way to help you
before you get that far.
Well, didn't you
feel frightened?
Frightened?
Yeah, of course.
Who wouldn't? Didn't you?
Oh, absolutely.
But then, I wasn't inside
like you.
After I advised you
on-on how to approach Gabe,
they put me in this secured van,
in case I could be useful.
Dr. Lee?
<i>But as it turned out,</i>
<i>you did fine without me.</i>
Are you all right?
Uh... yeah.
I'm sorry,
I feel a little... strange.
It's probably the drugs
wearing off.
I think you're finally
making some real progress.
At this point, the best thing
is probably for you to just...
get some sleep.
