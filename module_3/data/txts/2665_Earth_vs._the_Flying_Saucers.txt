Since biblical times,
man has witnessed and recorded
strange manifestations in the sky
and speculated on the possibilities
of visitors from another world.
Today, from the skies
of California, the fields of Kansas,
the rice paddies of the Orient,
the air lanes of the world,
come persistent reports of UFOs,
Unidentified Flying Objects,
which we have come to know
as flying saucers.
In Dayton, Ohio,
the Air Intelligence Command
gathers and sifts data from
all quarters of the globe.
Ninety-seven percent of the objects
prove, on investigation,
to be of natural origin,
while 3 percent still are
listed as unknown.
The Air Force is aware
of the widely held belief
that some of these could be
flying saucers from another planet.
While there is nothing
conclusive in the evidence,
the probing and digesting of information
about UFOs continues unceasingly.
As a result, headquarters of the Hemispheric
Defense Command in Colorado Springs issued an order:
All military installations
are to fire on sight
at any flying objects
not identifiable.
But even as they did so,
the military wondered
whether their scientific know-how
and their best weapons
would be effective in any battle
of the Earth vs. the flying saucers.
July 16. To Internal Security
Commission. Re: Sky Hook.
Summary and progress report from
project director Dr. Russell A. Marvin...
And Mrs. Dr. Russell A. Marvin, without
whose inspiration and untiring criticism
this report could never
have been written.
Married two hours and already
she's claiming community property.
Now that you're married, Dr. Marvin,
you don't have to sneak up on me.
You always did have eyes
in the back of your head.
Besides, it's not safe
when you're driving.
But pretty.
I thought intellectual giants were
supposed to be backwards and shy.
My third-grade teacher, Miss
Hickey, said I was a quick study.
You're starting something you're
not going to be able to finish.
Yeah.
Yeah, today, I've got a hot date
with a three-stage rocket.
Now, please, no interruptions.
Because of recent
scientific advances,
it is now possible to realize
an ancient dream:
The exploration
of outer space.
To prepare for this great stride
forward, we are assembling data
on conditions at atmospheric levels
beyond those hitherto explored.
To collect the necessary data, unmanned
automatic observation posts are being sent up
in multiple-stage rockets, to a distance
hundreds of miles above the Earth's surface.
There, swinging in endless
orbits around our planet,
will be 12 tiny man-made
satellites, or moons.
They will report to us by radio, thus
providing primary information needed
to prepare the way for
our ascent into space.
The effects of gravitational loss,
showers of meteoric dust,
the fierce and undiluted heat of
the sun, the cosmic radiation.
All will be studied and analysed.
At the present time, we have launched
10 of the artificial satellites,
or birds, as we call them. We...
Do you hear something?
Hear what?
I don't hear any...
Shh. Listen.
Pull over.
Russ, it was a saucer?
A flying saucer?
Well, we saw what appeared
to be a flying saucer.
That's all we can say.
We saw it.
We heard it, both of us.
What more do we
need to know?
Well, we have to have time
to think, to evaluate this,
before we sound off.
Let... Let me have a light.
Of course, it wasn't
a saucer at all.
I just shake like this
all the time.
Carol, I want you to transcribe
these notes for my report.
Yes, boss.
But there's one
little thing first.
Now that you're married, Dr. Marvin,
the first thing you've got to learn
is no more passes at the
secretaries during business hours.
All right.
- Or birds, as we call them. We...
Russ.
The saucer sound.
It's on the tape.
You forgot to turn it off.
I remember now.
I turned it off afterwards.
Well, that's one piece
of concrete evidence.
Rocket Number 11 will be
launched in 20 minutes.
Well, we'll leave it for now.
Come on, we've just got
time to get to the bunker.
General Hanley reporting
to Project Sky Hook.
Make it fast, will you?
I'm in a hurry.
Nobody allowed in, sir.
There's a rocket taking off now.
That's what I want to stop. Let
me speak to Dr. Russell Marvin.
West Gate to Bunker Number 2.
Dr. Marvin.
Bunker Number 2,
Marvin speaking.
This is the West Gate, sir.
General Hanley wants you.
Oh, put him on.
Carol, it's your father.
Calling from Panama?
No, right here at the project.
Hello, Russ?
Hello. Well, welcome home, general.
What's the news from Panama?
It's bad, I'm afraid.
I think you ought to hear what I found
before you send up another rocket.
Can you possibly put it off?
I'm afraid I can't, we're tied to a
definite schedule of launchings.
Wait a minute, uh, there's
something else I wanted...
Just a minute.
It's your privilege.
Hi, Dad.
What is it, honey?
I just wanted to hear your voice
and tell you Russ and I
were married last night.
Married?
Forgive us for not letting
you know, darling.
I've gotta hang up. Let's have
dinner tonight. Can you?
Don't forget. Bye.
Fourteen, 13, 12,
11, 10, nine, eight,
seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.
I know how the designer feels
hearing a thing like this,
but Project Sky Hook hasn't worked out
the way the Defense Department hoped.
Tell me, how many birds
have you sent up so far?
Eleven, counting today's.
And how many are you
in contact with right now?
Just one. Today's.
I admit we haven't been able
to track them visually so far,
but we'll correct that.
Don't be too sure
of that.
We can certainly tune them in
if they're up there.
What I'm trying to tell you is
that they're no longer up there.
That wasn't a meteorite
that fell on Panama.
It was the burned remains of Number
7. I made sure of that myself.
What?
And Intelligence has reports
now which convince us
that 1 and 3 fell over Africa,
Number 5 around the North Pole,
and 9 and 10 along the Andes.
The rest can be presumed to have
been lost someplace at sea.
What happens to them?
Apparently they blow up
in outer space.
Why? There's nothing
explosive in them.
You can take it from me,
when a rocket's blasted off, it should
circle the Earth for a long time.
That is, unless...
Russ? Dad?
Unless what?
Unless someone, something, shoots them
down as fast as we set them up there.
Why, no gun in the world
can shoot that high.
No. No, of course not.
Bring spoons for your coffee.
Ah, my special barbecue.
Mm-hm. That's to make up for not
telling you about our getting married.
It was kind of sudden
for us too.
Sudden? I've only been
after him for a year.
I don't need to tell you,
both of you, how pleased I am.
Well, I'm glad of that. I wouldn't
like it very much if you weren't.
Thank you.
Russ, what were you
driving at back there,
about something shooting
down one of the satellites?
General, we saw a strange
thing this afternoon.
We saw what appeared
to be a flying saucer.
A flying saucer?
It nearly ran into us.
You're sure of it?
Both Carol and I are subject to
the same atmospheric disturbances
that may have affected
other observers,
but there is a qualitative difference
when you're a scientist.
We do have one piece
of supporting evidence:
An accidental recording
of the sounds it made.
The tape is in the lab at the project.
I'd like you to hear it tomorrow.
You both saw this?
Yes.
Excuse me.
From Captain Holoway, sir.
Oh.
Will you sign here, please?
Who's Holoway?
He's on monitor duty this evening.
They've just lost contact
with Number 11.
Oh, Russ,
I'm sorry.
Is it still in range
of our receivers?
If it hasn't been knocked down.
Look.
What are those lights?
They're what the pilots
call foo lights.
St. Elmo's Fire,
in ancient times.
The superstitious regard them
as omens of things to come.
The best science has been able to make out
of them is that they're electric particles
agitated by moving air. Same
principle as the aurora borealis.
There have been so many around the project the last
couple of days, we all just take them for granted.
Bird 11 ought to be visible in the sky right
now, on its second lap around the world.
Look, there it is.
Was that it?
Yes.
Well, surely you're not going to
send up Number 12 tomorrow after this?
I have to.
Why?
With a television pickup, cameras and
microphone. I should've done it before.
This time I'm gonna know what's happening
up there and know the reason why.
Come on, let's finish
our dinner.
Checking TV pickup.
Getting a good image?
Fine.
TV's okay. I'll be down
in a couple of minutes.
Tell them to hurry it up.
Do you notice anything different
since you were here last?
Soundproofing?
That's right.
You could fire a cannon off outside
and you couldn't hear a thing down here.
Number 12 okay for takeoff.
Well, as an old rocket man from way
back, I'd rather watch from ground level.
Dr. Marvin. Dr. Marvin.
Marvin here.
You getting ready for a siege?
Well, Russ and I are gonna take turns
monitoring this one ourselves.
For days, if necessary.
Soundproof privacy and the last
word in scientific solitude.
Happy honeymoon, darling.
Thanks, Dad.
Prepare rocket for launching.
Prepare rocket for launching.
Rocket Number 12 will be
launched in five minutes.
Four minutes to zero.
Check. Take it up at zero,
Major Kimberly.
Okay.
Stand by.
Observation Tower A, come in.
Evans, Radar to Tower A.
Observation Tower A,
Sergeant Nash.
UFO due west, approaching fast.
What does it look like?
Can't tell yet.
I'll call when I get a better
reading on my scope.
Do that.
As you were, sergeant.
Unidentified flying object reported
due west, sir. Probably a buzzard.
Sergeant Nash,
Observation Tower A. What?
Forget it, Walters,
this is no time for gags.
It's two minutes to zero.
Sentry at West Gate has
spotted a flying saucer, sir.
Evans, Radar to Tower A.
Tower A, Nash.
I got a better reading
on my scope, sergeant.
That UFO is over
the west sentry post.
It look like a flying
saucer, Evans?
Yes, it does.
Sky Hook Control to
approaching object.
What is it?
I wouldn't know.
Connect me with Dr. Marvin's lab.
The line is dead.
Look at that, general.
It's landing.
Battery, prepare to fire.
Fire!
They set up an electronic screen.
The artillery doesn't penetrate.
Lines are out.
Abandon all
firing positions.
Mike's gone dead.
Try the phone.
The operator doesn't answer.
Look.
What's happening?
I don't know. I...
I'm scared, Russ.
They'll...
They'll dig us out.
Where am I? What...?
We are speaking to you through the
translating device above your head.
Can you understand us?
Yes, and I hope you
can understand me.
Whoever you are,
whatever you are,
you'll regret what you
did at the project.
Perhaps you can explain
why, after contacting Dr. Marvin,
we were met with violence.
You've contacted Dr. Marvin?
We spoke to him.
All he heard was meaningless sounds.
The same kind of sounds I just heard.
We had hoped a sufficient adjustment
for the time differential between us
would have been made.
I don't understand.
Evidently, you do not realize you
are in an interstellar conveyance.
You are already outside the
atmosphere of your own planet.
As a prisoner, all I am
required to tell you
is that I am General John Hanley
of the United States Army.
These are all the facts leading up to the
rocket explosion at Operation Sky Hook.
To the best of our knowledge, my wife
and I are the only ones left alive,
since we have not seen or
heard anyone for hours.
The air is becoming toxic.
In the event of our death,
this report, together with the recording
of the saucer sounds on this tape,
constitute all
the data we have.
The batteries are failing.
The recorder is not
running up to speed.
This is Dr. Russell A. Marvin.
Russ? Where are you?
It's all right, honey. The gas
generator stopped, that's all.
Please come close.
I'm afraid of the darkness.
Dr. Russell Marvin.
The tape.
It is very urgent that we meet.
We will appear tomorrow
at Operation Sky Hook
when your sun is exactly
over your local...
That's the sound of the saucer
we heard on the tape.
The message was sent
at an accelerated speed
so it just sounded
like gibberish to us.
When the batteries died,
the tape slowed down
and the voice
became clear.
If I'd only figured
it out before,
maybe we wouldn't have
been trapped down here.
What had snuffed out hundreds of lives and
leveled an installation worth millions of dollars?
An aroused public
demanded an answer,
and the federal government dedicated the strength
of all of its branches to the task of finding one.
However, when Dr. Marvin
and his wife were rescued,
the answer was to be found in the
experience of the only two human survivors
and in a reel of tape recording they
carried to Washington, D.C. And the Pentagon.
- Operation Sky Hook.
There can't be any
doubt about what it means:
A landing at the project was
proposed on the day of the disaster.
There was to have
been a meeting.
If I couldn't keep the appointment,
a message was to be sent
on a designated wavelength by
ordinary shortwave transmission.
Does anyone want to have
the recording played again?
You've heard it a dozen times.
My wife and I, for three days and
nights, have been telling what we knew.
We've been before every committee,
commission and review board in Washington.
It's time we decided
to do something.
The tape is by no
means conclusive.
Certainly doesn't prove that your so-called flying
saucer caused the destruction of Operation Sky Hook.
I grant you that.
A strange voice, a set of instructions
that might have come from anywhere.
Well, has anyone a better
idea of what happened?
Personally, I'm inclined to accept
Dr. Marvin's conclusion
about the connection between
the message and the disaster.
All right,
so am I.
Then why not let me try to contact them,
meet them, find out what this is all about.
If we are to be confronted with
a hostile and unknown power,
any decision to meet with them
must be made at the cabinet level.
Well, I just hope that while we're
waiting, another disaster doesn't occur.
We're pressing for the
earliest possible action.
The secretary of state is
flying back from Europe,
the secretary of defense is
returning from the Pacific.
If a meeting could be
arranged in the meantime,
the only risk
would be to me.
I feel personally responsible
for what happened.
I was in charge.
Hundreds of lives were lost.
My own wife's father...
If I had the authority, I'd grant
it to you. But we will have to wait.
But I promise you that we will recommend
that you be authorized to make radio contact
and meet with...
With whoever
they are.
Are we through for the night?
Yes,
but we're going to ask you
to remain at your hotel.
You mean I'm under detention?
You may be needed
at any time.
Major Huglin is
assigned as your liaison.
Good night.
Good night.
Dr. Marvin.
Dr. Marvin, I don't like this watchdog
routine any better than you do.
I'm under orders,
I have a job to do.
We're both on
the same side.
I'm sorry. I'm just tired and worried.
I know.
Well, you were in there. You heard
both sides. Who do you agree with?
I agree with you as far as the urgency
is concerned, but they're right too.
They're responsible to a chain of
command, they have to be careful,
and this thing may be too
big to allow for mistakes.
Russell Marvin calling on
225.6 megacycles. Over.
Dr. Russell Marvin calling on 225.6
megacycles as per instructions.
Are you listening?
If you hear me, please reply.
I am tuned in on the same
wavelength. Over.
We hear you,
Dr. Marvin, and we understand you.
Do you understand us?
Yes.
Who are you?
Listen. It is now 9:30 a. m. Earth time,
Greenwich Meridian Time.
We will be waiting at exactly 11:00 a.
m. At the shore of the Chesapeake Bay,
where the North Beach Road
reaches the sea.
Do not raise an alarm,
and keep this appointment.
Listen to me. I can't
keep the appointment.
I'm under orders. I'll be able
to meet you in a few days.
Do you hear me? Over.
Russ?
Hello, hello.
Dr. Russell Marvin calling
on 225.6 megacycles.
Do you hear me?
Please come in. Over.
Eleven o'clock Greenwich
time. It'll be 6:00 here.
I can just make it.
You're not going. I heard you
say you're under orders.
I didn't arrange this meeting.
I just asked them to wait.
Who ordered that radio?
I did, today. I was hoping they'd
give me the go-ahead and let me use it.
You can't go.
I've already lost Dad.
You shouldn't have called them.
Well, maybe I shouldn't have
and maybe I should.
But it's started now and I've
got to go through with it.
But it's not your job alone.
Call someone! Call Major Huglin!
Room 312, Major Huglin.
Hurry, please.
Hello?
Yes. Yes.
Thanks.
Well, call the garage.
Tell them not to give him a car.
Tell them he's sick,
anything, out of his mind.
I'll be right down to take care of it.
Sure thing, Mrs. Marvin.
Frank, may I have
my car, please?
Gee, Dr. Marvin, I can't.
I was talking to your wife on
the phone and she said that I...
But, Dr. Marvin, I can't
let you have the car.
Get out of my way, Frank.
Please, Dr. Marvin, I don't
want to lose my job. Ooh!
There he is. See if you
can get him on the radio.
Hello, Russ. This is Carol.
Russ, come in.
He won't answer me.
Wait for us, Russ.
Major Huglin and I
wanna talk to you.
Russ, please come back
with us.
I'm sorry, but I have to do
my job. Let's go back.
Please come in.
Come on, let's get out of here.
No, wait.
With your friends, Dr. Marvin.
I'm coming
with you.
Please come in. All of you.
I'm gonna phone
headquarters.
You'd better do
as they say.
We must be thousands of
miles away from the Earth.
And in a matter
of seconds.
You are many miles away
from your planets,
but not in a matter of seconds.
Listen to your watch, Dr. Marvin.
It's stopped. It's supposed
to be antimagnetic.
We generate a magnetic field stronger
than the gravitational field on your Earth.
This is the principle by which
we move through space.
We have adjusted the magnetic
field to compensate
for the normal loss of gravitational
effect and atmospheric pressure.
But your watch hasn't stopped.
Feel your pulse.
I haven't any.
Neither have I.
We operate in a very
different time reference.
You might say
all this is happening
between the ticks of your watch
or the beats of your heart.
And that's why we couldn't decipher
your message till it was too late.
It made it necessary for us to
defend ourselves at Sky Hook.
Then you shot down
our 11 rockets. Why?
At that time, we had no way of knowing
they were only primitive observation posts.
We thought they might be
weapons directed against us.
Who are you? Where are you from?
Because of your leadership in
exploring the field of outer space,
we felt you could
best understand
that we are the survivors of
a disintegrated solar system.
At this moment, the remainder
of our fleet is circling your globe.
They're awaiting a signal
to tell them where to land.
What do you want with me?
Arrange for your world leaders to
confer with us in the city of Washington.
They may not listen.
I'm only a scientist.
We will show you how important
it is to convince your leaders.
In an instant of
your time, we travel
from beyond your moon to
the surface of your Earth.
There were 300 men on that ship.
Speed, maneuverability and force.
With a weapon like that, why don't
you just land and take over?
To do that would cause
worldwide panic.
Despite our power,
the few of us would
be busy indefinitely
trying to suppress a large,
hostile population.
In the end, we would be masters
of a wrecked and hungry planet.
What makes you think you'll
conquer us without a fight?
We felt it would be best to meet with
you so fighting could be avoided.
Such agreements have been
made on Earth before.
How do you know
so much about us?
We have the means of
accumulating information.
If you wish to convince yourself about
our detailed knowledge, test us.
Any question.
What's the size of the Armed
Forces of the United States?
It is approximately
3 and one half million men.
Well, what team has won
the most World Series?
The New York Yankees.
Who was the first president
of the United States?
Washington.
I know that voice.
Who are you?
John Hanley.
My father. What have
you done to him?
You have been addressing General
Hanley's mind, not General Hanley.
Look behind you.
Dad.
He will not recognize you.
He has been subjected
to a machine we call an
Infinitely Indexed Memory Bank.
We have transferred all knowledge
from his brain to our machine.
Thus, we have available and readily
accessible his total experience.
We can do this to as many as we like
and learn whatever we must know.
Oh, stop it,
please, stop it.
Put that gun away.
Don't look at that.
This is the beginning of the process
by which we read the brain
for the Infinitely Indexed
Memory Bank.
What have you done
with my father?
We will return him to you eventually,
and the police officer too.
Will you arrange
a conference for us?
We will tell the authorities you
want one. That's all we can do.
You're not going to cooperate
with these monsters?
It may take weeks or
months to set it up.
You will have two of your lunar
days, or 56 days Earth time.
Let them kill us now
and be done with it.
Please, Carol.
If our officials don't believe me,
I can't be held responsible.
When you tell of the
destroyer being sunk,
refer to latitude
30 degrees, 20 minutes,
longitude 45 degrees, 15 minutes.
They will believe you.
Well, suppose Major Huglin,
my wife, myself were all hysterical,
or hypnotized, or whatever
you're thinking,
that we never saw what these fiends did
to General Hanley or the police officer.
How do you explain the destroyer?
There's word that the Atlantic fleet has
lost contact with a vessel in the area,
but there's no confirmation of a sinking.
However, we're continuing to check.
You realize, of course, your contacting the saucer
in the first place violated our instructions.
This itself may have placed the safety
of the entire country in jeopardy.
Now that the damage is done, and
assuming your story is verified,
are you proposing that we meet
with these...? These creatures,
and yield to
their demands?
And why Washington?
If they want to parley with the whole world, why
do they choose the capital of the United States?
They appear to be realists, and Washington
is one of the centres of political power.
What about our atomic
and hydrogen weapons?
Wouldn't they be effective
against these saucers?
I'd like to answer that
question, sir, if I may.
Our atomic weapons might be
effective, if we could deliver them.
But to use nuclear power when they
land would destroy our own cities.
And then we don't know whether
they are vulnerable or not.
In answer to your question, Mr. Cassidy, I've
learned a little about their mode of operation
and I've got an idea for
a new kind of weapon.
It's only a guess,
of course.
A new weapon in
less than 56 days?
I have an idea for
an ultrasonic gun.
With enough scientific
and engineering help,
we could construct a working
model in a very short time.
Maybe it will work. If not,
we'll know soon enough.
And in the meantime, you'll be working
on every other means of defense.
We have no choice but to use every
conceivable weapon if they land.
Gentlemen, please.
"The destroyer Franklin Edison was
sunk at latitude 30 degrees, 20 minutes,
longitude 45 degrees, 15 minutes
at approximately 0600."
We are expected at the White House
in an hour for a policy decision
that will probably involve not only
our own country but the entire world.
Whatever the decisions,
you may be certain that you'll be given
every assistance in testing your theory.
I suggest you start
to work right away.
Major Huglin will make arrangements
for whatever facilities you may require.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hi.
How's it going?
Well, instead of turning electric
impulses into ultrahigh-frequency sound,
we nearly burned the place
up about an hour ago.
What?
All right, let's try it
out on the cement block.
All the way.
Well, there goes your generator.
But it worked, Russ.
It worked, didn't it?
We know what
hit Sky Hook.
What?
Sound.
Sound? Ha-ha.
Having two small boys around the house, I
know that noise doesn't do a man much good,
but burn him up,
knock his house down?
The sound I had in mind was of a higher wave
frequency than we've ever been able to produce.
Then you mean we've
got the weapon?
No, I'm afraid not.
With the best materials
and circuits available,
all we've succeeded in doing is
pulverizing the end of a cement block.
The theory is beautiful.
We don't have the tools and
the materials to make it work.
Maybe in 10 years,
five, even two.
How many days left?
Twenty-seven.
Russ, remember that report
from Dr. Patek in New Delhi?
He suggested a
different approach.
Instead of attempting to duplicate
the ultrasonic devices of our visitors,
we try to interrupt
their magnetic field
by projecting a highly intermittent
induced electrical field.
Now, suppose we take...
Of course!
We cut the ultrasonic wavelength into the
circuit and knock them down like clay pigeons.
Not so fast, Russ...
It can work. It can work.
Here, major, get on the phone.
Yes?
We'll need the largest portable
generator that Schenectady makes.
From all parts of
the globe, under top priority,
came every facility
and scientific help
the governments of
the world could furnish.
Dr. Marvin and his staff assembled these
necessary materials in a concealed laboratory,
where they were to translate a short
experience in a craft from outer space
into a formula, then plans,
and, finally, a functioning reality.
It's only a hollow steel ball,
but for our purposes
it's a flying saucer.
You can start up
the generator now.
The magnet does that,
doesn't it?
The magnetic attraction above is enough to
counteract the pull of gravity from below.
Go ahead, it was your idea.
You be the first to try it.
My idea?
Nonsense.
It was just as much yours, and Dr. Patek's in India,
and a dozen other scientists' all over the world.
Come on.
It works.
It works fine.
Russ, look.
What was it?
The same kind of thing that's watched
us since the beginning of the project.
Watched who?
Russ and all the developments
of the rocket program.
I always thought it
was St. Elmo's Fire.
I'll have to change
my mind about that.
Whatever it was, the saucers sent
it down to find out what we're doing.
We have
television.
They may have some totally different
device that serves the same purpose.
We'd better get to Washington
before they decide to drop in on us.
Major, give Cutting a hand and load
that gun on the generator truck.
Right.
Never mind the files, professor.
I'll take the diagrams.
We ought to be in Washington
in about an hour.
I hope they haven't
spotted us.
Let's pull away from
the lab. Come on.
If that saucer stays
in firing range,
we may be able to give
the gun its first real test.
Saucer landing
near Belmont Lab.
Major Huglin calling for
aerial protection. Over.
They're sending
a bomber.
We ought to go on with those
diagrams as quickly as we can.
I'll get them from Russ.
I'll go with you.
Fire up the generator. We're
gonna see if this gun really works.
What's the matter?
I can't get this blasted thing started.
They're looking
for us, all right.
Russ, getting you and the plans to Washington
is more important than anything else.
She's right.
She's right, if this machine works.
If not, it doesn't make any difference.
It works. If we just had
a little more power.
Russ, let's go, please.
Before it's too late.
Keep the gun circling overhead
and the saucer will stay away.
Russ, be careful.
I think it's dead.
It's light as a feather.
Humanoid, and ancient.
These suits must serve as an
electronic and mechanical outer skin
to take the place of their
atrophied flesh and muscles.
I must get this to a lab.
Don't go out there.
Don't go out there.
Oh. Here are Dr.
And Mrs. Marvin now.
Carol. Russ. We've
been waiting for you.
Thanks.
This is Dr. Alberts.
How do you do?
You know General
Edmunds, Admiral Enright.
Certainly.
And Mrs. Marvin is
General Hanley's daughter.
Mrs. Marvin.
Your father's death was
a great loss to all of us.
Thank you.
Well, I see you've
been busy.
Oh, we've been
doing a little work.
Here, let me show you. It didn't take
too long to break this thing down.
These helmets have a
language-translating device in them.
Mrs. Marvin, would you say
something into the microphone?
The quality of mercy
Is not strained
It droppeth as the gentle
Rain from heaven
Shakespeare
wouldn't like it.
Professor Alberts said if we read the
dictionary into the device, word by word,
we'd have a translation of those
words into their language.
By translating their communications into
our words, we were able to decode them.
Professor Alberts requisitioned the electronic
translator which his university had developed,
and the results, to say the
least, have been startling.
We've recorded a number
of their messages on tape.
One of the messages appears
to be a plan of attack.
The rest
were operational routine.
I'll show you how it worked.
Over here.
"We can expect trouble when
Mercury is in perihelion. "
When will that be?
It happens twice
every three months.
The information is too vague
to be of any use to us.
And "the sun in
con Polaris"?
That implies an
orbital relation
between the star
Polaris and the sun.
We've never been
able to figure it out.
The blanks probably refer
to their time computation.
But these messages
do involve the sun?
Panama and the other observatories
are watching it around the clock.
In the meantime, we have a
newer and stronger version
of our interference machine on
the drawing boards at Aberdeen.
Has there been any determination
of the weapon's useful range?
There's a weakness.
Our instruments indicate that the potential
effect drops off sharply after 1500 yards.
We'll have to hope
that that's enough.
Well, maybe we'll be ready
for them when they come.
Has anyone tried
that helmet on?
Yes, we have. I think
you'd be interested. Try it.
It weighs only
a few grams.
What's it made of?
We don't know exactly.
Solidified electricity is the fancy name
given to it by the Bureau of Standards.
It resists everything we used on it,
including the most extreme temperatures.
It makes me Superman,
for one thing.
Yes, we know.
I have a peculiar
range of vision.
I can also hear a young man
just outside that window,
discussing a problem
in advanced biology.
Carol, would you
see if I'm right?
When I kissed her good night,
she slapped my face. I said:
"I didn't slap yours when you
ordered a $4 steak for dinner. "
You know, just as we need
glasses and hearing aids,
these people need electronic
amplification of all their senses,
especially sight
and hearing.
Does that suggest
anything to you?
They have their
weaknesses.
When will we
be ready?
We'll need at least
a couple of weeks.
People of Earth, attention.
People of Earth, attention.
This is a voice speaking to you from
thousands of miles beyond your planet.
This is a voice speaking to you
Stop that.
From thousands of miles
beyond your planet.
Look to your sun for a warning.
Following eruptions on your sun,
there will be eight days and nights
of meteorological convulsions...
Turn it down.
They're arrogant enough, announcing
their schedule in advance.
They're coming down to take over, they
made that clear to us in the saucer.
They can move so fast and strike so hard, they
ought to be able to sneak in and flatten us.
They expect to terrify us
with a display of power.
They're contemptuous
of our defenses.
If I'm right, they'll sail into
Washington in broad daylight
and expect us to capitulate
when they land.
People of Earth, attention.
People of Earth, attention.
This is a voice speaking to you from
thousands of miles beyond your planet.
Look to your sun for a warning.
Look to your sun for a warning.
It's coming over
everywhere.
Following eruptions on your sun,
there will be eight days and nights
of meteorological convulsions.
Soon thereafter...
They'll panic and
immobilise the whole country.
The whole world.
Let all nations be represented
in Washington to confer with us...
People of Earth, attention.
In every country of
the world, in every language,
every means of electronic communication
was jammed with the message.
The warning was dinned into
the ears of the Earth's population
unceasingly for 12 hours.
And after the 12th hour, silence.
Then, a tremendous explosion
on the surface of the sun.
"Nine days. "
That must be what
the missing words meant.
I get the picture. Thanks.
If I need any more information,
I'll call you back. Goodbye.
That was the Bureau of Meteorology.
As we know, sunspots have a
direct effect upon our weather.
We can expect heavy storms,
tidal waves, hurricanes.
When?
Beginning now and
continuing for eight days.
Just when we most need our
communications and transport.
We'll have to work under the worst possible
conditions to prepare for an attack.
What's the schedule,
general?
You're working on the installation
of the interference units.
Our plans for evacuating the city
are already underway.
Then it's been decided
that we'll fight?
When an armed and threatening power
lands uninvited in our capital,
we don't meet them
with tea and cookies.
There's the job of production
expediting waiting for me.
I don't believe further
discussion would solve our problem.
Before we break up, I remind
you that we have nine days left.
One of those days
is already half gone.
What a nice
going-away present.
You might call it that.
Is my bag packed?
Mm-hm. Mine too.
What time do we leave?
I have to leave right now.
I'm going to Aberdeen to
supervise the interference project.
So that wasn't a hello kiss
at all. It was goodbye.
For a little while.
You're gonna have to leave town.
They're evacuating Washington.
Where am I going?
Palm Springs.
Remember the place
I told you about?
Mm-hm.
We were going there together.
I know.
Your plane leaves tonight.
Russ, let me stay.
Maybe I can help.
There's nothing more you
can do. Here's your ticket.
You'll arrive before
the bad weather sets in.
And I'll be there soon.
The first of man's
vital communications to suffer
were the shipping lanes
and airways.
Then transport by rail
and highway ground to a halt.
When the telephone
and telegraph systems had failed
and the radio networks were forced to
bear the burden alone, they, too, succumbed
to interference known to originate in
an increasing disturbance in the sun.
The world, crippled
by these events,
waited for the first sign of
an invasion from outer space.
Because of the atmospheric violence,
it was not until the ninth day
that an orderly evacuation of the city
of Washington could be attempted.
Although the authorities and
the military worked miracles,
when the 10th day dawned,
more than 60 percent of
the people of Washington
were still in the
metropolitan area.
Take these to CIC.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Marvin.
Your husband told me you
were in Palm Springs.
The plane schedules were
canceled before I could get away.
Have you heard
from Russ?
There's been practically no communication
with Aberdeen. Wires are down, radio jammed.
But I'm expecting
a courier any minute.
A red alert.
Saucer heading in low
over the Atlantic, coming in fast.
They're breaking through our
defenses. Ground all aircraft.
They'll be overhead any minute.
You better get down to the shelter.
Wait a moment, Mrs. Marvin.
Truck convoys from Aberdeen are
taking up positions in the city.
Your husband's section
is nearing the Pentagon.
Thanks.
Mobile unit calling GHQ. Saucer
hit and down in the Potomac.
Keep it in your field
so it can't fire at us.
Fire at the saucer
until it crashes.
Russ. Russ.
Carol, I thought
you'd gone to...
GHQ calling all HF units.
GHQ calling all HF units.
Saucer hovering vicinity
White House and Capitol.
Attention, all units. Saucer now landing
vicinity White House. Attention, all units...
Sounds like
they're jamming us.
Dr. Marvin. Dr. Marvin,
we've made contact with GHQ.
GHQ to all HF units.
Attention. Saucer has landed
in front of Capitol building.
All HF units, attention.
GHQ to all HF units.
Keep firing at saucers.
The present danger is ended.
The present danger is ended.
All units report to your commanders
for further orders.
The present danger is ended.
Don't wiggle.
Here's what it says:
"The president has ordered
Project Sky Hook rebuilt,
and the space exploration
program continued
under the direction of
Dr. Russell A. Marvin.
The United Nations assembly voted unanimously
today to award a gold medal to Dr. Marvin. "
And to Mrs. Marvin goes a
gold medal from Dr. Marvin
for her love, courage, devotion,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Russ, do you think
there are any more?
Will they come back again?
Not on such a nice day.
And not to such a nice world.
I'm glad it's still here.
And still ours.
