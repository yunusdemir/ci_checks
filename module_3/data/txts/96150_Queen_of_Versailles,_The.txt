Wanna do one on his lap?
Oh. Oh.
I'm in pain.
- Is this Santa Claus?
- I'm in pain.
We've been doing this
for four hours.
- Three.
- Three hours.
My husband, when I got married to him,
all I wanted
was love from him.
And he always said,
"Trust me,"
and I put my trust
into him.
So if-- so...
we'll see what happens.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
In the breakfast room,
the lock--
if you pull on it,
it comes out,
but I'll be there
in two minutes.
I'll show them
when I come in.
Goddamn, our house
is falling apart.
Why do you think
she's trying to block you?
You said you--
you don't care what I do.
I said I don't care what you think.
We're home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place
like home.
It's always nice
to be home.
And no place
like your own bed.
Through these
hallowed gates.
Mrs. Florida '93.
Aw, look.
Look at her.
She's worn out.
Look at me, I got to
come home in my socks...
'cause my children
took my shoes.
My name is
Jacqueline Siegel.
I am in Orlando,
Florida.
I'm a 43-year-old
mother of eight.
I am from Binghamton,
New York.
I'm not a city girl,
I'm a small-town girl.
Tell me when you're ready.
My name is David Siegel.
I'm 74 years old.
I am the founder,
president,
CEO of Westgate Resorts,
the largest
privately owned
time-share company
in the world.
When I grew up
in Binghamton, New York,
pretty much
the only place to work
and make money
was IBM.
And I figured
I could either be
a secretary
and work for an engineer
or I could be
an engineer.
So I got my computer
engineering degree,
and then I
worked at IBM.
I had this
little cubicle,
but there's hundreds
of other people,
engineers in their
own cubicles.
And then I came into
the office early one day
and I asked my manager,
"Which project
are you working on?"
He says, "I wrote
my own program
to count down
the years, days,
months, weeks,
minutes,
down to the second
of when I retire."
And I said, "Well,
why would you do that?"
He said, "Because
that's when I'm going
to start living my life."
And I said, "Wow."
I put in my resignation.
I was out of there
in a week.
I packed my bags and I moved
to New York City
and started modeling.
Then I met a man
on Wall Street.
I got married.
He moved me
to the Everglades.
And while I was down there,
I saw an ad in the newspaper
to win Mrs. Florida.
I entered it.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you
your brand-new
Mrs. Florida.
Here is Jacqueline
Solomon.
And then I ended up getting a divorce.
And I met
my current husband
through Mrs. World.
Mrs. Florida '95
invited me
to her husband's
40th birthday party.
And being a bachelor
that had just gotten out
of a 27-year marriage,
first person I saw
was Jackie,
and I was smitten.
I thought she was the most
beautiful girl in the world.
It took me a while
to fall in love with him.
It just really felt wonderful
to be so adored.
That's what
attracted me.
There's 30 years
between us.
I tell you,
he doesn't need Viagra.
But at least there is that option
if he does, like--
I don't know,
10 years from now--
but at least
there's that option.
It's show-and-tell
today,
so I got to get them
to school.
- Bye.
- Bye.
All right, let's hurry.
Come on.
Let's go this way
so China doesn't bite us.
Bye.
Have a nice day.
Can't see what she sees in me,
but we have
a great relationship.
What she lacks
in being a housekeeper,
she makes up in--
she loves people,
has more friends,
she's a big extrovert,
but a good person,
a good heart,
and a good mother.
Okay, tilt your head.
There we go.
- Mommy.
- What?
Oh, lookit, the doggy's
eating a cockroach.
Ugh.
I grew up
in a one-bathroom,
three-bedroom house,
and I can remember
I would have to wait in line
to use the bathroom.
In this house we have, I think,
17 bathrooms.
In our new house
we have 30 bathrooms,
so you won't have to
keep your legs crossed
very long.
The reason why we really
want the bigger home--
for one thing, I think
my husband deserves it.
I think it'd be a lot like
a lifetime achievement.
I think he's worked
so hard.
And even though
this house,
which is 26,000
square feet, is so big,
we're bursting out
at the seams.
- Bye, girls.
- I'm going to go look at our new house.
Look at this thing.
Oh, my God!
We went to France
and we saw Versailles,
and we were inspired
by the French architecture.
I drew it on the back of an envelope
on my way to Las Vegas.
In Las Vegas, we looked out our window
and we kind of copied
the top three floors
of the Paris Hotel.
Probably should have used
smaller envelopes
because it turned out to be
the largest home in America.
We never sought out to build
the biggest house
in America.
It's just-- it, like,
kind of happened.
This is so beautiful.
This is our
grand ballroom.
We have the grand
staircase on each end.
Mm-hmm.
This is a palace.
Can you imagine, like,
the dances and the parties?
I said, "Well, I'd like
to have a bowling alley."
And then he says,
"I want a health spa."
And then I said,
"We need maid's quarters."
I forgot
how many kitchens.
10 kitchens.
We have a sushi bar.
Two tennis courts--
one will be a stadium court--
a full-sized
baseball field
which will double
as the parking lot
when we have parties.
This is our ice-skating
slash roller rink.
The children
have their own wing.
They have their playroom
with a stage
where they can perform
and do their--
whatever they do.
Okay, this is the staircase
that I would come up
if I was going
to visit the children.
We wanted to put
everything
that we could dream of
in this home.
And we're going to have,
like, an orchestra up here...
- Uh-huh.
- ...for black-tie affairs.
The house will be filled
with Louis XIV-type
antique furniture.
That's our observation deck.
Every night
we go up there
to watch
the Disney fireworks.
So, by the time we both
got what we wanted,
now it's 90,000
square feet.
Jackie, is this your room?
No, that's not my room.
- Where's your room?
- That's my closet.
Oh, no way!
No way!
Where's David's closet?
Oh, that's his closet.
- That's my husband's closet.
- All right, this is it.
My husband filled
the garages up
with our marble
from China.
This is what $5 million
worth of marble looks like.
I gotta go
kiss my dog.
My husband knew how special
Chanel was to me,
so he had her stuffed for me,
and now she's upstairs.
And this one, a staff member
ran over him in the driveway,
but now he's on my piano.
So, you ask me
why I'm building
the largest home
in America.
And my answer is
because I could.
You mentioned being a kingmaker
and having a big role
in the 2000 election.
I sure did.
I got George W. elected president.
Personally got him
elected president.
It is nice to be here
with so many good folks
- from the great state of Florida.
- Yeah!
Businessman David Siegel
says America owes a lot to him.
I think we are responsible
for George Bush
becoming president.
Now, had I not stuck
my big nose into it,
there probably wouldn't
have been an Iraqi war,
and maybe we might have
been better off-- I don't know.
How were you
personally responsible
for the reelection
of George Bush?
I-- I'd rather not say it,
'cause it may not necessarily
have been legal.
Jackie, can you imagine
falling down these stairs?
♪ Here she is, Miss America... ♪
This is so pretty!
This is, like, the nicest,
grandest house
in all of
the United States.
Right here.
What I have today
is what I worked hard for.
A fellow came to me
in 1980,
and he said he wanted to buy
10 acres of my orange grove.
He said, "I'm going
to time-share it."
I said, "What's that?"
He explained
the concept to me.
I fell in love
with the concept.
I didn't sell him
the land,
and I decided to build
a time-share resort
in the back
of my orange grove.
I started building
16 units,
which I thought was more
than I'd ever need,
and people started
buying them.
We now have 28 resorts
in 11 states.
The three largest
time-share resorts
in the world are all
Westgate Resorts.
We are considered
the Rolls-Royce
of the time-share industry.
They call me
the time-share king.
I have built one of the icon
properties in Las Vegas.
It's 52 stories
of beautiful blue glass.
At the last Miss USA,
Donald Trump, he said,
"Congratulations
on your new tower."
He said, "Got one
problem with it."
He says, "When I stay
in my penthouse suite,
I look out the window,
all I see is Westgate."
He said, "Can you turn
your sign down a little bit?"
I have the brightest sign
on the strip.
Well, we want to go to this
and we want to go tonight.
Well, then we can
set you up for the presentation
tomorrow morning
at 10:00.
We're going to do a walk-through
of the building,
and then we'll have
a light breakfast or a lunch.
In return, we give
you guys show tickets
to any of the shows
listed here.
You guys make
over 60,000?
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- Are you married?
- No.
Are you guys--
you're a couple,
though, right?
- Of course.
- Oh, yeah.
Now, the top five
floors of our building
are like penthouse
condominiums, full ownership.
Sylvester Stallone,
Bruce Willis,
the Rock, Usher-- those are some
of the celebrities that own upstairs.
This isn't just a celebrity
wall of fame of who's who,
this is David Siegel,
our developer and owner.
A lot of these are different
charity events he donates
a lot of time and money to.
So that's a good thing.
Let's go on out
in the hallway.
This is South Beach, Miami.
This is the Lakes,
which is in Orlando.
This is Park City, Utah.
This is where you guys are
going to learn to ski.
Okay.
You know, the typical
time-share family
will stay in a motel
with two queen size beds,
small TV on the dresser,
and one bathroom.
When they walk
into the room,
the kids want to turn on
their cartoons,
the wife wants to watch
her soap operas,
and the husband
wants to watch
his football game
or sporting event.
They get up
in the morning,
they go
in the bathroom,
the wife goes in,
steams up the mirror
so the husband
can't shave.
They go out
and we have a booth,
and we say, "Well,
if you'll spend 90 minutes
and see what
we have to offer,
you can get
free Disney tickets."
And at 7:00
in the morning,
they're lined up
at my resort.
As they're getting
out of their car,
the wife is saying
to the husband,
"Don't you dare
buy anything."
And he says,
"Oh, don't you worry,
they won't sell me
anything."
- You guys ready for the wow factor?
- Yeah.
All right, this is
our four-bedroom.
- This is 2,382 square feet.
- Okay.
This accommodates
14 people comfortably.
You much
of a sports fan?
You've got the choice
of watching it on the flat screen
or-- this is where the projector screen
comes down.
And it just
blows them away.
That motel-- if it looked bad
before they came,
it looks
twice as bad after,
and all they do
is dream about
coming back the next year
and staying at Westgate.
We show them how what they're going
to spend on motels
over the next
10 or 15 years,
they can afford
this time-share.
Let me ask you guys this:
- Do you like the units?
- Yeah.
Could you see yourself
going back to renting
regular hotel rooms
and giving this up?
- No.
- Absolutely not.
All right,
if it were affordable,
is it something you guys
would consider owning today?
- Yes.
- Let's go downstairs.
Let me show you what
it looks like on paper.
Everyone wants
to vacation like a Rockefeller.
We show people
how they can.
Everyone wants
to be rich.
If they can't be rich,
the next best thing
is to feel rich.
And if they don't
want to feel rich,
then they're probably dead.
In my heyday of my shopping,
I probably spent over
a million dollars a year.
I have a $17,000 pair
of Gucci crocodile boots.
I have ostrich feather
Gucci pants
that are probably $10,000.
I have a ton of purses.
I think purses
are a good investment.
If you ever
get into a bind,
you can always
sell them on eBay.
Of course,
I'm just the opposite.
I could care less
about clothes
or material things.
Mr. David is a real disciplined man.
He's my idol.
He exactly knows what's
going on in this house,
every corner
of this house.
He monitors our bills
for water and electric.
Even if he earns
billions of dollars,
he knows exactly what--
where his money goes.
- Hi, Ricky.
- Hi.
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hi, Ricky.
- Hi.
- Hi, Ricky.
Hi.
- Hi, Ricky.
- Hi.
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.
These kids,
they're the king and queen
of the house.
I have eight children--
seven by birth
and one that I inherited.
Having my children
fulfill me.
When I was going through
my modeling career,
I didn't want children.
First of all, I thought
it would destroy my body.
Then I couldn't stop
having them.
It was like an addiction.
Or maybe it's because I finally found
a husband that would make love to me.
I changed a lot
of people's lives.
A lot of people are better off
for knowing me.
I certainly changed
my three wives' lives.
I brought wonderful
children into the world.
You know, I have
seven under 12.
I have six
grown children.
I think everybody
is better off
for being either my child
or my employee.
Rise and shine, Drew.
We're leaving
in 15 minutes.
Rise and shine.
Come on,
rise and shine, Drew.
Drew likes to stay
in my room.
Maybe he feels comfortable
and safe in a small room.
It's like my teddy bear at night.
I hug him and he gives me--
like I'm a mom.
Even though I'm not
the real mom,
I'm not the biological mother,
but I feel like I'm a mom.
I'm not their--
are you done, Drew?
Flush the toilet.
Come on.
- You're at ISO 320?
- Man
My name's Victoria Siegel,
but I like to be
called Ricky,
and I'm 12 years old.
I'm the oldest out of seven kids,
plus my cousin Jonquil.
She's 16.
Jonquil is actually my niece,
my brother's daughter.
She was estranged from him
for many years
and her mother passed away.
Jonquil grew up in kind of
a broken environment.
When we got Jonquil down here,
she had no clothes.
She came down
with one little suitcase
filled up with these filthy,
dirty stuffed animals
that had never been washed
and dirty underwear.
I said, "Tell me
what your room's like
so I can, you know,
kind of decorate your room."
And she said,
"Well, my room's, uh..."
You know how she talks--
like, "The dirt room."
I said, "What do you mean,
the dirt room?"
"Well, it's in the basement
and it's got a dirt floor."
I remember one time
she told me, like,
she got kicked out
of her house or something.
She had to sleep on the streets
one time with her mom
in a playground
or something.
Now that I've got
a taste of it--
like I've had a taste
of dirt-poor
and a taste of filthy rich,
yeah, I like it.
I mean, who wouldn't?
Getting everything you want?
But at the same time,
I still want to, you know,
be the old me
in a way.
I don't want to be,
like, totally changed.
You know, I don't want
to be spoiled.
We used to be kind of snobby.
Like, at my birthday parties
I would get a tiger,
and I would brag
to my friends
that we have
a pet tiger and stuff.
And then I used to be
a brat to my mom,
but then Jonquil
came here and--
I don't know, she's changed
a bunch of us.
So now we're just like,
I don't know,
normal, I guess.
Nothing's really normal
about this life.
Like, you know, getting
everything you want,
having a huge house
and another one in construction,
having drivers,
you know--
it's like you don't really
have to worry about money,
but at the same time
you do.
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, haven't seen you.
- I need to look like Miss Universe.
- Okay.
Do you think purple
looks good in my hair?
- I'm in a big rush, so...
- Okay.
- We got a Miss America party tonight.
- Okay.
If you could make them
look pretty for--
we have all
50 contestants coming,
- and Miss America at our house.
- Ooh, nice.
- Okay.
- So they need to look like pre--
like Miss Teen Americas.
Get, like, 50 pieces
of chicken nuggets.
- What do you guys want?
- A couple Big Macs.
- And a Diet Coke.
- And a Diet Coke for her.
Okay, just get, like,
50 chicken nuggets
and we'll share it
with everyone in the salon.
- No, I don't like chicken nuggets.
- With all the sauces.
- Wow.
- How beautiful.
We're proud to present
a check for $25,000
to the Miss America
Foundation.
Hey, did my stairs get shorter
or are these girls--
- We only had 38 of them here last year.
- Oh.
- All of them are here this year.
- Wow.
I love beautiful women.
I grew up during
the Miss America days
when Miss America was
the most famous woman in the world.
I used to actually get tears
in my eyes when I watched
"Here She Comes,
Miss America."
And I'm trying to do
what I can
to bring it back
to where it was.
Okay, ready, David? Here we go.
Jacqueline, here we go.
Big smiles.
I got to talk with Mrs. Siegel,
and she was telling me
a little bit about her background,
and it's kind of similar how
my background parallels to her
'cause we kind of
came from not very much,
but it's something
that I'm very proud of.
I'm very proud
of my background
growing up on a dairy farm
in a small town in Indiana.
And now I'm Miss America.
It just goes to show you
that anything is possible,
but not without hard work
and dedication
and passion
for what you do.
She wants to get married
and have babies.
That's what she wants.
And does
Miss America allow for that?
Does it create
opportunities for that?
Well, if she accepts
my proposal,
but she hasn't
accepted it yet.
He is a hoot.
There's a downside to everything.
Of course there is.
My husband told me
when I turn 40,
he's going to trade me in
for two 20-year-olds.
- Hey, hi!
- She's from Oviedo.
You're a tall one.
- Miss Colorado.
- I love Colorado.
I love Wisconsin.
Wyoming, great state.
Hey, Victoria, can I get a picture
of you and Miss America?
This is Victoria.
- Got it.
- Thank you, Victoria.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Oh, what's wrong
with being rich?
That, too.
Now, what would
you rather have,
a rich guy
or a good-looking guy?
Have you ever wondered
what it was like
to be like a fish?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Um, not really.
- Oh!
I think we just lost Drew.
Good morning, Westgate!
- Why are we here?
- To save lives!
To save lives.
And you thought you were just selling
time-sharing, didn't you?
We sell vacations.
Vacations are
healthy for you.
- Do you believe that?
- Yes.
I can show you
the articles and the studies.
Those who take the fewest
amount of vacations
are most likely to have
a heart attack.
You're just like a doctor,
a nurse, a fireman,
a policeman,
a lifeguard.
They all save lives
and you all do it, too.
But we're not
just saving lives,
we're also saving marriages.
Mom's on Facebook
catching up
with all the friends and relatives
and Dad's going through the TV.
Where are the kids?
Playing video games.
So there's a breakdown
of the family unit.
There's no communication
going on anymore.
Once a year, folks,
take your kids
on vacation!
Get to know them.
Let them get
to know you again.
Our number one person
in Orlando
owns several weeks
of time-share.
You know, you should own
at least one week yourselves.
And if you don't,
lie and say you do!
Don't let these people leave here
without buying something.
Something.
Whether it's big or small,
make sure they buy
something.
Today, make a sale, save a life,
let's have a great day!
This is David A. Siegel Day
in Las Vegas
because he built
the new icon
on the Las Vegas strip.
This is the most expensive,
the biggest, and the nicest
that's ever been built
on the planet.
I did not grow up
with a silver spoon
in my mouth.
I grew up very meager.
I lived in
a 1 ,200-square-foot,
two-bedroom,
one-bath house
in Indianapolis, Indiana.
My father wasn't
that involved with me
as I was growing up
because he was in business
and had to make a living,
you know, for the family.
My grandparents
were never wealthy,
and the reason is is that they lost
their money in Las Vegas.
You know, the casinos in Vegas
aren't built with the owners' money,
it's built with
all the losers' money.
My grandparents
were Mr. and Mrs. Vegas.
When they walked
into the casino,
they were like, "We got your
favorite suite all lined up for you.
We have those show tickets
that you wanted.
You wanted to see that new guy Elvis
Presley, we got your tickets for him.
And Frank Sinatra--
we got you in the front row."
So, basically,
here's a nobody.
But when he's in Vegas,
he's a somebody.
Please welcome to the stage,
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. David Siegel!
This building--
I'm going to dedicate it
to my mother and father.
My dad, he's looking
down on it.
He would be so proud.
Whoo!
I've set up all
of my sales departments
to copy what Vegas did
for my grandparents years ago.
When you walk in, you're like,
"Wow, this place is exciting."
100 % of the people
that we're talking to are--
it's not a nice word,
but we call them "mooches."
They're coming in
for a sales presentation
on their vacation
for a free gift.
So we train our salespeople
on how to take
someone greedy like that
and get them to buy today.
We do 100 % of our sales
on the first day.
We don't really take
many vacations
'cause it's really,
really expensive,
but if we had something
that would make it cheaper...
They will not buy today
if they don't get
a "great" deal,
if they don't believe
they're getting a great deal.
The total down payment
on this is $2,090.
- It's a whole lot better than 25,000.
- Yeah.
We sell them as low as $8,900
for three nights
in a studio
every other year,
all the way up to $149,900,
which is a four-bedroom
New Year's week every year forever,
their entire lives.
They pass it on
to their kids.
Their kids pass it
on to their kids.
Time-sharing--
typically you sell
every unit 52 times
because you sell it by the week.
May I say,
"Welcome to Westgate"?
I can't believe we did it.
You're changing your life.
We were in line
to do a billion dollars
in sales for the year.
Everything was great.
We were on top
of the world.
All we were thinking about
was adding more resorts
and employing
more people
and growing
the company larger,
and it came
to a screeching halt.
We got a big problem.
At one point, the market
fell over 700 points.
The day that left
Wall Street reeling.
Alan Greenspan called it
"a once-in-a-century
financial crisis."
September of 2008,
when the financial system
ground to a halt
with the bankruptcy
of Lehman
and all the banks
about to go under--
Wall Street is tumbling.
Main Street is stumbling.
Reporter
waiting to see how low
the Dow will go.
Banks lent hundreds
of billions of dollars
to home buyers
who can't pay them back.
Wall Street
took the risky debt,
dressed it up
as fancy securities,
and sold them around the world
as safe investments.
My business depends heavily
on easy access
to cheap money.
We sell our product
for 10 % down
and we take back
a 90 % mortgage.
What we used to do was take
those mortgages to the banks
and they would give us
an advance.
Well, unless we can turn
that mortgage into cash--
I can't very well
pay my employees
with mortgages
each week.
But the banks
are frozen
as far as my business
is concerned,
and it's a struggle
trying to find money
to finance our sales.
I don't think
I would rank myself
as a billionaire today.
I would say it's touch and go
right now.
So this used to be
the employee store?
- Yeah, this was the employee store.
- Oh, no more store.
No more store.
The reason they shut down
the telemarketing is because
there's no financing
for the sales--
'Cause the banks don't
want to lend the money.
Yeah, people
don't generally pay cash.
- It's like buying a car.
- Mm-hmm.
This whole side
was day shift.
And then the night shift--
that would be filled up.
So it was very lively
in here.
It was two days prior
to Thanksgiving.
Very sad.
So, you know,
spirits were high in here,
and then half the people
were called up to the front,
and those were
the people that were
going to be let go.
And then there was like
20 to 25 of us that were left.
I mean, I had never been
in a situation or an environment
where that many people
have lost theirjobs at one time.
You know, I mean,
the crying--

It was almost like
a funeral procession.
No, it's rough out there.
When I looked in that room
and to see all those empty cubicles,
to think of how full of life
that was at one time
and all those people
that had families,
and, like overnight,
all those jobs were gone.
When you have 7,000 people less,
you have a lot
of empty space.
They all had someplace
to go to work.
So those same people
that used to motivate me
are now out of work
and struggling, and I feel bad.
I feel bad for
every one of them.
I've affected a lot of lives
by what's going on.
Everything's for sale.
Our planes-- we have
an auction company
listing everything.
We're not selling
everything, but we're--
everything's available
for a price.
So, hopefully,
we can figure it out.
Got $100 million
just burning a hole
in your wallet right now?
Then you can buy
the palace
that time-share mogul
David Siegel
already wants to sell,
even though
it's not even complete.
The largest
single family home
under one roof
in America.
It's bigger than
the White House
and it could be
an entire land
at Walt Disney World's
Magic Kingdom.
It's a replica based on
the Royal Palace
of Louis XIV
of the 17th century.
My dream house
that I was building,
it's about 50 % complete.
I finally had to list it
and put it on the market
to satisfy my banks.
It's the jewel
of the United States.
There's never been
anything like this.
This is a true visionary,
modern-day palace.
And we all know
that you can't go
to France and purchase
Versailles,
because it's used
as a museum.
So it's your own
Versailles

Well, we're listing the house
finished for $100 million,
unfinished for $75 million.
We've got over
$50 million into it,
plus the land
and all that,
and the bankers
want us to unload it
for under $15 million.
I hope they left
a door open for us.
I can jump through
a window, Mom.
Don't worry.
So, who likes
the beautiful window?
- I love that.
- Yeah, that was over
a quarter of a million dollars.
Mommy, is that
a lake?
That's the lake,
yes.
Look at all those spiders.
Wow!
So, Marissa, just think
of the bright side--
you might not have
to clean this house.
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. How are you?
- Very good.
- Wow, this is just incredible.
I'll tell you,
it gives me goose bumps
every time I walk
through here.
- It's kind of an emotional day.
- Oh, of course it is.
This is our
dream home, but you can't cry
over things that
you cannot change.
Mom, do you think that
somebody's going
to buy it?
I don't know.
I don't know
if they'll buy it or not.
Not that many people
can afford
that kind of house.
In that $75 million range,
there's not too many people.
Even the ones
that have money,
Orlando would have to be
the place they want to be.
Tiger lives here still,
Shaq, and there's a lot
of real estate people,
orange juice families, and--
here it's like
feast and famine.
I mean, some of these people
have so much money,
they don't know
what to do with it.
They're spending it
like crazy,
and then the other ones can just
barely afford to keep what they got.
Since I was young,
I've been dreaming how I wish
I could go to America.
Every Filipinos, it's our dream
to have our own house.
Those Filipinos
that was here,
they have their families
in the Philippines,
and they have big houses.
I bought a piece of land,
so if God permit
I can go home,
maybe I will
build a house
for that piece of land
that I bought.
I need some money
to go home.
If you go without money,
it's not easy.
So I need to save
some money.
- Come on, let's go.
- No.
- But, Virginia...
- What?
I have, like-- I still have, like,
five more tardies left.
- It doesn't matter.
- No, they're going...
It's already 11 years.
The children
really attached to me.
I really love them
like my own,
since I do not have
my family here.
It's just that
the last time
I see my kids,
my youngest one,
he's only seven years old,
and now he's 26.
The Siegel kids,
they always say,
"Nanny, I love you,"
one thing that I never heard
from my children.
So I'm happy for that.
I miss them.
It's okay.
I still have kids,
the Siegel kids.
Hey, you need to go faster
if you wanna burn calories.
- You want French fries?
- No, I'll wait.
Hey, what's going on
with this building?
It looks kind of vacant.
- It's all
in foreclosure.
It's a shame.
This is a nice area.
They built
a nice thing here.
It's a pretty building.
I heard there's, like,
65 foreclosures
just an hour worth
where I live.
It's kind of sad,
you know?
Yep.
It's changed a lot
in the last three years.
A lot of people don't like
to be seen in limos anymore.
They think it sends the wrong signal
when times are tough.
Are you ready for
your cheeseburger in paradise?
I met Jackie and David
at a Little League baseball game.
Our boys play
Little League together.
She was volunteering
behind the concession stand.
A lot of people are afraid
to talk to them,
you know, 'cause they're
very powerful people,
but they're just like
everybody else.
They're down-to-earth.
Hey, Drew, do you know
which field it's on?
Strike!
You'd have
to show me that.
I don't follow you.
But they're not funding me
enough for Vegas.
I will-- look, I'm at my son's
baseball game,
and when it's over,
I'll call you back.
There you go.
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.
- Come on, Drew, one more strike!
- Come on, Drew!
Is that cute or what?
I want to see our house
finished so bad.
You got this one. Come on.
What do you think of that dome?
It's like from the Vatican.
With the sun
shining through,
it'll look like
jewels up there.
You know, I paid cash for the house
and then put
a mortgage on it
and put the money
in the company,
just like with the house
that I'm in now.
Why have an asset that doesn't
have a mortgage on it
when you're using money
to make money?
I bought you
a lottery ticket the other day.
- That's a waste of money.
- Not if you win.
Ugh.
Come on, Drew.
How was it
flying commercial?
The first time I
took the boys on a commercial plane,
they said, "Mommy,
what are all these people
doing on our plane?"
Okay, now we got to get a car
or something, right?
Yeah.
From Florida?
What brings you here?
I'm coming here to visit
some friends and family
that I haven't seen
in, like, over 10 years,
some of them maybe 15.
You're from here?
Binghamton, actually,
but it was cheaper to fly here
and I'm on a budget now.
What's my driver's name?
- I'm sorry?
- What's my driver's name?
Oh, it doesn't come
with a driver?
- It's included?
- There's no driver. No.
Sorry.
Oh, here's Beth.
I've got my kids.
- They can't wait to go swimming.
- Oh, good.
Oh, I missed you.
- Thank you again.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
It's good seeing you.
Jackie and my granddaughter Beth
became very good friends.
I think everything that
happened to her is unusual.
I don't know anybody that
married such a wealthy man.
Jackie worked
at a diner
and did very, very well
in school.
But engineering back then
was kind of unusual
for a girl to do,
but I figured,
well, she was smart,
so that's what
she wanted to do.
The first marriage
was a big mistake.
Not-- of course, at the beginning
they didn't think so,
but I think
as time went on,
she had many
serious problems.
I was in a marriage to a man
that became
more and more abusive.
He started to hit me
and stuff like that,
and then he gave me
a scar across my face.
He says, "Now you can't
make your own money."
And I went to the hospital
and he went to jail that night.
And the next morning,
I just grabbed
as many of my modeling
pictures as I could--
I mean, that was
my whole life--
and some clothes
and that was it.
Now my turn.
Okay, my turn.
Now it's my turn.
Come on, kids.
Come on.
Come see where
Mommy grew up.
- Daniel.
- Come on.
I want to show you
where I grew up.
Oh, my God, look at how big
those trees got.
There she is.
I knew they were
building a house,
but that's all
I knew about it,
and it was unbelievable.
I mean,
who in heaven's name
has a $75 million house
they're going to sell?
And it isn't even done.
My husband had all these
Xerox copies made
of this news clipping
and I gave it
to everybody.
We went to a party
Saturday night,
and all my neighbors
that were at this party,
they now have a Xerox copy
of all this info
'cause I thought they'd
be interested in it, and they are.
Well, the American dream
is raising way up above
what you started with
and achieving something
way beyond
what anybody would dream
that you would achieve,
and that is exactly
what she has done.
Typical middle-class America
just wasn't going
to make her happy.
She wanted to do something
really exciting and really big.
Hi, kids!
Come on in!
I miss Jackie a lot.
Everywhere she was, I was.
And everywhere I was, she was.
Everyone would ask,
"Where's your other half?"
And that's how it was
all through high school.
It was supposed to be
that way after,
but then we made
different choices in our life.
She decided to go
to college
and I decided to marry
my high school sweetheart.
Tina, no, I am impressed.
This is a beautiful home.
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.
No, it's like a dream come true.
I would be lying
if I didn't say
I envy her life
to some extent.
I mean, there's a lot
of things in the world
that I'd like to see,
that I'd like to do.
I've never owned
a new car in my life.
If I didn't have cash
to buy a car,
I didn't have a car.
I never had a car payment.
I don't own a credit card.
So how do you guys think
you could do in a house this size?
- I like it.
- You like it?
I would love to have more money,
but I don't know that
I would want that much,
because my dreams
don't even go that big.
It looks little, but...
What about
the "for sale" sign
on the front
of the building?
Have you had a lot
of inquiries about that?
From the team
members, you mean?
- Yes.
- No.
After they got
past the auction--
- Yeah.
- That was a little bit scary.
The "for sale" sign is...
So when we put up
the "foreclosure" sign,
that's going to probably--
We had all of our
noncore assets
put up for an auction,
and we only sold, like,
one or two things.
You know, a hotel
which was valued
at 20 million
a couple years ago,
we sold for 8 1/2 million.
And so the auction
was a flop.
David Siegel, he is
spending all of his time
looking for money still.
Every day, all day long,
weekends included,
he is looking for money
to keep the Vegas
project going.
He's been to
Donald Trump's office
a couple times
trying to get help.
He's gone to Dubai
and Switzerland.
We're looking for
about $400 million.
So any of you that want
to write a check,
we'll pay you back
in a few years.
Basically-- basically, we spent
660 million to build it.
And right now, we owe
about 240 million.
So we have over 400 million
into it, you know.
We don't want to walk away
from that money, obviously.
He will tell you that the lenders
are pushers.
They got us addicted
to cheap money,
and once
we were addicted,
they took away
our money,
and now we're addicts.
We have to have
that money in order
to maintain the company
that we built.
...two-bedroom deluxe.
Yes, ma'am,
I am aware of that, but...
My father
is all about quantity.
He wants to take any deal.
I don't care if they give us $50,
take the deal.
Our customer
is the Walmart customer,
the Johnny Lunchbucket--
you know, your $40,000,
$50,000 people.
When this first started,
we were taking anybody
that was breathing.
If they had the down payment,
we would write them.
Our lenders basically said,
"You're selling subprime
to people that really can't
afford your product."
I was actually calling
in reference to your--
looks like you were set up
at the Westgate Town Center,
and your account's on the--
obviously it's on the default list.
I don't know if you were
having a hardship
or what happened, but...
...to see what we could do
and be able to help you out
with this dilemma
that you're going through.
One morning, everybody--
we walk in and they gave us
the bad news.
They had to let people go.
Altogether,
with the nannies,
there were 19 people.
And now it's just--
with the nannies and myself,
it's just four people,
and it's very difficult.
The nannies
are working more now.
They're working
around the clock.
Okay, here's the school.
We've cut back
everywhere we could.
Hi. Hi, children.
The kids were
in private school.
They're now
in public school.
Debbie, get in the back.
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.
- I don't know.
- I told them
that they might have to go
to college now.
They might have to actually
make their own money,
and that's kind of like--
I mean, they're realizing
that now,
that there might not be
money there for them,
you know?
So I said, "Start thinking about what
you want to be when you grow up."
Have you fed
the lizard here?
No, 'cause nobody
takes me to the pet store.
He hasn't eaten at all?
Oh, I feel so bad
that he hasn't eaten.
Well, I feel so bad nobody
takes me to the pet store.
Look, he's starving.
Look, he doesn't even have water.
Okay, but that's because
they never take me to the pet store.
Like, I always ask
Marissa and Richard
and they're like,
"No, I'm too busy."
I'm going to go get
a piece of turkey.
I can't believe you guys
don't feed the lizards.
- He's not moving.
- He's not moving?
I don't know
if he's dead.
- Debbie.
- Did you kill him?
You gotta give him water, too.
Oh, you guys killed him.
- What?
- You killed him.
I know. I apologize for being
such a horrible person.
Oh, Debbie.
He's not my pet.
David, look.
He's dead.
I didn't even know
we had a lizard.
Nobody would take me
to the pet store ever.
Well, he didn't
even have water.
It's not like that would
have made a difference.
Maybe he died
of dehydration.
Oh, I apologize that
I'm a horrible person.
I didn't say you're
a horrible person.
Well, you're making me
feel like one.
Yesterday he jumped right in.
My father's first wife is my mother.
They were married
in 1961
and they divorced
in 1968.
Now, my father was paying
my mother child support.
But even when he had millions,
we were poor.
I mean, I even
remember getting
swamp cabbage for us
to eat for dinner.
However, we were
the best-dressed kids at school,
because every year my father
would give us money
to go clothes shopping.
So we always had
great clothes,
but we had no money.
Finally, my father called us
one day and he said,
"Would you like
to come live with me?"
That was in 1980.
And I said, "Yes."
I didn't even think twice. "Yes!"
That first year in Orlando
was one of the best years
of my life.
They had a housekeeper
and they had a cook
and they got a chauffeur.
They bought a limousine.
That summer, before I went
into my junior year,
my stepmother said,
"I've already raised my kids.
I'm not going to worry
about your father's kids,
so you all need
to move out."
I never held a grudge
against my father
because even though
I only lived with him for a year,
he still paid for me
to go to boarding school,
he still paid for my college
and gave me a car.
My father and I aren't close
on a personal level
because it's always been
a business relationship.
When we talk,
it's all about business.
We're father and son,
employer, employee,
but we're not close.
Work is my life 24/7,
and I don't know
any other way to do it.
I'm a victim of my own success
or failures.
The company and myself
was the same thing.
So whenever the company was
signing on the dotted line,
they wanted my personal guarantee,
my signature.
Fine. Everything I had
was in the company
'cause I'd never taken
anything out of the company.
Wendy, you're the only one working
out of, like, 25 people.
Okay, I guess
I'm the chef now.
Okay, now what, Wendy?
Now, what's our next step?
- Corn?
- Almost done-- it's done?
No, he likes it, like, crispy.
Hey, how was
the baseball game?
I never
would have had so many children
if I couldn't have a nanny.
When I grew up, I didn't know
there was a such thing as a nanny.
So I figured I'd probably
have one kid,
and then maybe two.
But then when I found out
I could have nannies,
I just kept having
the kids.
I mean, they're just
bundles ofjoy.
Mama! Mama!
- Come on.
- Come on, girls.
Wendy, let's do it
like a proper dinner.
Can we just sit together
like a nice family?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Fine.
Right-- over there.
Oh, they're crying.
Just tell them
it's a princess party.
Drew, come here.
We're trying to get
Daddy's dinner ready.
We're gonna do a surprise
for Daddy's birthday.
We need everyone.
It's Daddy's birthday.
Okay, now could you
go get some plates
and, like,
put them around?
Hey, you found one?
Found another one?
Oh, is he home?
Oh, the TV's on.
- You just noticed?
- Yeah.
Hurry up, Dad.
Hey, honey.
How long till you're ready?
- Ready for what?
- To come out.
I'm not coming out.
I've got work to do.
What do you mean
come out?
Turn the bathroom
light out.
Please stay tuned for
a message from our tyrannical dictator!
Daddy's going to be
in a better mood
in a couple of minutes.
- Time-out.
- But you touched it.
I hope Daddy's coming.
Let me go wash
my dirty, filthy hands--
ooh, so I can sit on
that dirty, filthy seat.
Yuck!
Why is this night different
than any other night?
'Cause we eat
at the table.
Nobody is crazy enough
to build a building that size
and that expensive
unless they have
a guaranteed market.
They just think they're doing us a favor
by letting us be there.
They don't seem
to understand.
♪ Happy birthday
to you... ♪
By not taking any money off the table,
I'm at the mercy
of the bankers.
They say, "Jump,"
and I say, "How high?"
No, no.
No, no.
I think he's humbled.
My husband's humbled,
which I kind of...
like it, actually.
What would you wish for
in the last 25 years
of your life?
Besides me, of course.
If I have to live
to 150, that's what I'll do.
You know, if that's
what it's gonna take
to get back on top again.
Those aren't edible candles.
Right now I just
need to sell it.
And, you know, there's not
too many buyers
for 90,000-square-foot houses
at that price.
Oh, my God.
Aw. I just want one picture.
Can you take a picture
with my cell phone?
This was going to be in our spa
in our big house.
David's barber chair.
It's a beautiful chair, isn't it?
I picked out so much stuff
over the years,
it's, like, been 10 years
in progress.
The majority of it
is probably French
to go with the theme
of Versailles.
These things over here
is all from the genie bottle
from the Aladdin Hotel,
right here.
What do you call it--
the eggs from Russia?
Fabergé eggs.
But look,
I got the giant ones.
If we do sell the house,
then we probably would auction it off,
but we're going to wait
and see what happens.
You know,
I'm fine with it.
I married David
for richer or poorer.
And if we-- I want to use
some of the antiques now,
so I'm kind of picking
some smaller pieces
that could fit
into our current home.
I know there's, like,
a superior source
or something that's guiding us
in the right way.
David, Daniel,
could you help me
get some of your old toys
that you don't want anymore
so I can donate it?
How about stuff like this?
I mean, are you guys
using this backpack?
No.
That's a backpack?
What time
is it now?
Well, if I could
afford a watch,
I would tell you.
Wow, but you can afford
that jacket and your iPhone.
Daniel:
I hope it's not doggie caca.
- Ew! Is it?
- Yeah.
That's why I hate
having so many dogs.
I've been up and down
my entire life.
I mean, I've been
married before
and I didn't have to worry
about anything.
I was making tons
of money modeling,
and then I was poor again.
I've been a cocktail waitress.
I mean, I even--
in the nursing home,
I used to clean dead people
and prepare them
for the morgue.
For $3.35 an hour.
This building
used to be an old--
like a Home Depot-type of store.
My husband bought it
years ago,
so I thought this would be
a perfect opportunity.
I could raise money that I could
give back to the community.
I bought some of the inventory
from hotels and stuff,
like the old microwaves
and things like that.
And we get donations.
All this and this over here
is my personal stuff
from the house.
It's the stuff
that I've donated.
With the bankers
just not funding
the company anymore,
we were forced
to lay off 6,000 people.
The bankers
made us do it, so--
they're probably going
to get mad at me for saying that,
but that's what I heard
and that's what I understand.
Most of the people here
are Westgate employees.
I just felt it was a way
that I could really do something
to help people
in a desperate situation
that don't deserve
to be there.
$30 brand-new.
We got them from the same vendor
that Macy's gets them from.
$79.99 at Macy's.
Here's my dressing rooms.
Should I put curtains up or not?
Orjust leave them like that?
Yeah, curtains?
I have evolved
from being someone
who just went out
to charity lunches
all the time
and went shopping to wear something
to the charity lunches
to actually doing
something more in my life
to make a difference.
Hey, Tina.
Hi. How are you?
Good. I haven't talked
to you in a little bit.
I know.
It's been a while.
But, hey, that money
I sent you,
was it able to save
your house?
No, no, it was not.
It didn't save
your house?
No, I-- I talked
to the mortgage company
and, you know,
I was all excited,

that you told me
I needed to pay you."
They run it through
their system or whatever
and he says, "Nope, sorry,
they won't-- they won't take that."
Oh, my God.
And I only owed them
$1 ,700 to begin with.
Unbelievable.
So, you actually lost
the house?
Well, it's in foreclosure.
They're not going to let me
stop the foreclosure.
Jackie's a friend.
They help me
with a lot of things.
You know, occasionally
I have a wedding
that somebody wants
a Rolls-Royce,
and I'll borrow that
so the bride can go
to and from the church
in a Rolls-Royce.
My wife's working
double shifts
and I'm doing as much
driving as I can.
We didn't even put
our tree up yet.
I got into
the limousine business
when I saw that real estate
wasn't doing that well.
And that's the only thing
that kept us afloat.
I had a good job
in New York.
I worked for a commercial
real estate company.
We moved down here
for a better life
for the kids,
and you try to keep going
and make more money
and buy more houses.
Altogether,
we had about 19 houses.
My net worth?
Probably about 3 1/2 million.
Now zero.
Everything changes.
Within a month after
the bankruptcy court was finalized,
the lawyer told me we had
to be out of the house.
And then we moved in here.
My friend's rental.
It happens pretty fast,
but, you know,
you survive.
Hi, Tom.
Did you get a donut?
It's hard going back
to renting.
- No?
- Yeah, I got one.
You can see there's
nothing on the walls,
so it doesn't really feel
like it's your house.
It humbles you a lot.
Our family and health
and the kids
are the most important thing,
and friends.
You know, you can get by
without owning a house.
You can't get by without
friends and family.
You know, that's the most
important things.
This is my palace.
This used to be
the twins' playhouse,
but they don't use it,
so I use it.
Yeah, and it's good
to have this.
Like when it's too noisy
in there,
just run here, quiet.
I asked Jackie
if I can use it,
and then she said,
"Are you serious?"
Yes, I am.
This is the bed.
I'm using this,
but then I folded it,
because when you get in,
it's all over here.
You cannot-- you cannot
get in-- through.
I love this place.
And I'm so glad
Jackie gave it to me.
I promised him before I left
that I'm gonna have money,
then we can do that--
we can build our own house.
Before that happened,
he passed away.
I'm supporting
not just my children--
my brothers, my sisters.
All the money
that I have is--
I'm sending it to them.
So maybe that's
still good for him.
David Siegel said, "Do not
touch anything in that room.
I don't want a chair, a table,
a copier, a computer--
I don't want anything taken out
'cause we will be reopening."
And here we are
seven months later.
Everything has stayed
the same.
Well, this was my office.
I wish I could turn on the lights,
but they shut them off
to save money, I guess.
The lenders kept
trying to get us
to stop sales on the building,
which we wouldn't do.
And finally,
they were so mad
that he kept doing it
when they said not to
that they laid the law down
and we had to stop sales
of this building.
This is where we sold at least
$100 million a year.
And we could do
up to $200 million a year.
And now it's just empty.
The reason that
they wanted us to stop sales
is that they wanted us
not to pay them
so that they could go
and foreclose on the building,
which they have already done.
I almost feel like
the bankers
are like vultures,
like, circling around,
waiting for the animal to die
instead of helping out
the situation.
No one knows that this building
is being foreclosed upon.
If our owners found out,
we would have a mass exodus
in our hands.
They would be stopping payments.
All of our people
in our company are paid
by those monthly payments.
So we live and die
by those monthly payments.
I really don't understand
the financial community,
especially when they get
all that money from the government.
I thought that that rescue money
two years ago
in September of 2008
was supposed to go--
be passed on
to the common people
or, you know, us.
She knows we need to cut back,
but it's difficult for her.
She's still compulsive.
Where she slows down
one activity,
she accelerates another one.
My husband all the time
tells me not to spend money.
He says if I keep spending,
then he's going to shut
my credit cards off
orjust not pay them.
And he says he might not have
the money to pay them anyway,
so it might not be
either/or choices.
Wait, wait, wait.
I got Daniel.
Daniel needs a ramp,
not that one.
He doesn't need this.
No, I need the--
all the perfume and stuff
for the stocking stuffers.
The boys like this
for the stockings.
For Bear.
You know how Bear
likes to walk around
with something
in his mouth.
You're taking
everything out.
- It's too much.
- I know.
My wife collects everything.
She can't have one bird,
she's got to have a dozen.
Can't have one dog,
she's got to have a dozen.
Can't have one child,
she's got to have seven.
So...
what can I tell you?
Whew.
Oh, my Lord.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Excuse me, get down.
Oh, shit.
- It's okay.
- Yeah, that's for Drew.
Yes.
That's too small.
Oh, gosh.
I can't believe we don't
have a bartender.
Mr. Siegel, you need
a bartender tonight?
Then who's coming over
to serve the food?
- Is there any bartender?
- No.
- How do you do?
- Good, thank you.
- Seneel?
- Teneel.
Teneel, okay.
Get everything
organized here.
Honey, we've got people
coming and you're not even ready.
They're arriving.
- Well, give me five minutes, then.
- Hurry up.
I don't want David
to buy me any Christmas presents.
I don't need it.
All I want is,
you know, just for us
to be happy together,
get along,
and I want to see
our family and our friends
with smiles
on their faces.
- Oh, my God!
- How are you?
Nothing makes me happy
these days.
I'll be happy when I find
a solution to this.
I can't separate business
from personal.
And here is the hostess
with the two mostest.
- Here's Grandma.
- A great present for Jett.
- Here's Grandma!
- Grandma!
Oh, he's huge!
Jett!
Give Grandma
hugs and kisses.
If I could have
anything that I want for Christmas,
I would say $300 million
to take care
of what we have in Vegas,
and I will be just fine after that.
Marissa, you need to put
the Rudolph costume on.
Here, I'll come
help you.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- We got to hurry.
- I need china.
Everyone's arriving.
I don't know why
they didn't set up a bar.
No, no, no, no.
All right, should I send
my mom in here and help?
Because I got to go get
some Christmas presents.
I have to just--
I don't need help.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
All right, 'cause I got
too much to do.
- I don't have enough help.
- This is a pain in the ass.
I really miss
having a manager
that does
all this stuff for me.
All right.
Let me just--
Okay, let me just open it.
♪ Rudolph the red-nosed
reindeer ♪
♪ Had a very shiny nose ♪
♪ And if you ever saw it ♪
♪ You could even say it glows. ♪
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
- Hi.
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, Rudolph is here!
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
- You got the key to my Rolls?
- No.
- Did you drive it?
- Yeah, I brought it in
and personally
handed it to Jackie.
I don't know--
I don't--
then they came back in
and they said the lights were on.
Yeah, and I went back out.
I turned them out.
I never saw the key again.
- Did you use it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we did a quick wedding.
- Did I get paid?
- Absolutely.
- Who'd you give the money to?
- Jackie.
You didn't give--
I never saw the money.
- It's where the key is.
- I never saw the money.
Well, no, it always
drifts off now
at this time of year and stuff,
but it'll pick up and stuff.
- Must've been tricky, yeah.
- We're going to sell David's house.
- Everything will be fabulous.
- Tricky couple of years.
Now the loan comes due.
I'll pay you the interest
like I'm doing now.
And they said, "No."
So now I send
a third party to go see
how much they'll sell
that loan for.
They wrote it down-- 11.
They sold the loan
to the third party.
They didn't know
I was involved.
$3.2 million.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I'm getting it back.
What a bunch of idiots.
So I'm going from
owing 18 million...
...for 3.2 million.
- I mean, that's--
- That's why banks are in trouble.
Who the hell's making those--
I mean, I'm glad they did,
but who's making
those decisions?
- Love you.
- I love you, too.
Merry Christmas.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Honey, let's go.
Everybody out.
- It's, you know--
- All right.
It's almost--
it's getting late.
I love the BB.
I love you.
Merry Christmas.
Okay, that's enough.
Our life is definitely
more challenging today
than when we first
got married.
I try to put blinders on
and do my thing,
but it's there.
Okay, Merry Christmas,
and we'll see you
in the morning.
The stress
has actually made us closer, stronger.
And I think,
you know what they say--
when you're down
is when you find out
who your true friends are.
Where's all the kids
clamoring for their toys?
Where should I put these?
Next to Daddy.
Wait, I lost BB's puppies.
I need to find it because
the python will eat them,
eat the puppies.
Oh, my God.
- Are her puppies lost?
- Uh, yeah.
Puppies!
- Jonquil.
- Huh?
Since it's your snake
going around the house,
can you help me
find the puppies?
All right,
I'll look for them.
Do you get strength
from your marriage?
No.
Not really.
I-- it's kind of like
having another child.
Oh, I found it.
- Look.
- Both?
Oh, my God, they're like trapped
in the corner here.
I think they're scared.
I don't know where
to pile my presents.
Here, I'll help.
I'm putting mine over here.
Maybe you can put yours
right in the center.
- I showed Daddy.
- I got the crystal growing thing.
When I lived in New York
and I would see
rich people on TV,
I'd be like, "Wow, you know,
their lifestyle must be nice.
Like, if I lived
that lifestyle,
I would just wake up every day
with a smile on my face."
But now that I do,
it's like I wake up now,
and it's just--
I'm used to it.
And then it's like
you want more and more.
I got another Yahtzee.
I got another baby doll.
Good morning, Victoria.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
I got... Monopoly?
What am I going to do
with Monopoly?
Well, actually, I gave you these gifts
like five years ago,
but the kids were too young
for you to play with,
so I'm regifting.
- 'Cause you never opened it.
- Risk? What's Risk?
That's a great game.
That's when you
take over the world.
We're not the typical family,
that's for sure.
And, I mean,
I don't want you
to get the impression
that we're penniless,
but we're going through
a very difficult time.
Our lenders-- I mean,
they have cut my paycheck.
My CFO said,
"Well, that's not enough
for him to make
his mortgage payments on."
And so one of them
lenders said,
"Well, then, let him move
into an apartment."
Look what I got.
It's a present to myself.
Oh, I just can't wait
to eat my caviar.
How much is this?
Like $2,000?
I don't even know.
Aw, this tastes so good.
Whoever got you
that is going to get fired,
I'll tell you that.
If the company fails,
they may have to go to work
and not be able
to go to college
or get a college loan.
No, I haven't done--
put anything aside.
This is for my mother,
who isn't here today.
When your grandmother
was on her honeymoon,
she was on a train
going to Chicago,
and she asked my father
if he would buy her
the Hershey bar.
And he said,
"I don't have a nickel."
And so ever since,
every birthday,
I got her a Hershey bar.
She said, "If she's not
here to eat it,
I should eat it for her."
So I'm gonna eat it for her.
Thank you, Mom.
On my wedding day,
my father gave a speech,
and he looked at my wife
and he said,
"You will never have anything
to worry about in your life."
We worry every day.
Everyone in this company
has had not one pay cut--
two pay cuts,
three pay cuts.
We've all taken big hits.
I went to him last week
about money.
"You have to give me
some money.
I need money."
And he said, "I would
give it to you if I had it.
I can't give you anything."
So right now, I'm applying
for a home equity loan
and I just upped
all the limits
on all my credit cards.
Vegas is what's causing
our big problem.
And the bank's answer
to a solution is,
"Just hand us the keys
and give up
the 390 million
that you put in it."
And my answer is,
"Over my dead body."
I mean, he told me,
"I'm not giving it up.
If I have to bankrupt it,
I'll bankrupt it."
That's what David
said to me, too.
And then Michael
said today,
"Your dad's gonna
go down with the ship."
The ship's not going down.
He bankrupts that, they're gonna stop
funding the rest of the company
- and the company goes.
- No, they won't.
- They have too much to lose.
- That's correct.
This building
is much more important
than building the largest house
in America.
He has built the largest
time-share company
in the world,
and this is
the pinnacle of it.
It'd be a real shame,
though, to actually lose it.
If they use
every method they can
to try to get
the building back,
then at the 11th hour
I bankrupt it and buy time.
Time is...
what I need.
If he throws this building
into bankruptcy,
then he risks
the rest of the company
because our lenders
are financing
the rest of the company.
They have made it
very clear to my father
that if he turns over
the keys to the building,
that his company
would become a cash cow.
They would continue
to finance it.
He wouldn't have to worry
about anything
and he would go back
to life as normal.
He can go back
to building his house,
flying in his plane,
buying other resorts.
He'll have more money
than he knows what to do with
if he turns over this building.
Everyone is against him
trying to keep this building.
I've had arguments
with my own brother
who screamed
and yelled at me,
"What are you doing
to this family?
What are you doing
to this company?
How can you support him?"
All of his people--
his attorney,
his closest friends,
his executives--
all turning
against him.
He's the one that made
a lot of people a lot of money.
If he says he's going to continue
to try to keep this project,
then I'm going to continue
to support him.
And right now, him and I
are the only ones standing alone.
It's amazing.
I think when you first
started filming this,
we were on top
of the world,
building the largest home
in America.
Everything was wonderful,
no worries in the world.
If I remember, you said
why am I building that large home?
And I think I said,
"Because I can."
A lot of things have changed
in the last two years.
So this is kind of like
a reverse
of a rags-to-riches story.
This is almost like
a riches-to-rags story.
Okay, no more texting.
Hello?
Oh, Jackie.
I'm good.
I'm at the doctor's.
Tell them you'll
call them back.
Let me give you my--
well, okay, I'll call you.
Okay.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Raise the brows again
and then relax them.
- Okay, so we're just gonna go--
- Ooh.
A little injection.
Good, there we go.
It's kind of embarrassing
for people to see me
looking like this.
I was just going
to go and hide
in the bedroom
for a few days.
I'm having a hot flash
right now.
My face is burning.
Debbie,
you got a winner.
It's a buck.
Well, a dollar
is better than nothing.
Oh, I'm teaching my kids
how to gamble.
- That's terrible at such a young age.
- It's not gambling.
- This is gambling, Debbie.
- It's scratching off tickets.
- Huh?
- It's scratching off tickets.
It's gambling that
you're going to win.
Usually, you lose.
So, what do you think?
I don't know.
- Do you--
- Come on.
Maybe I should go with the zebra
instead of cheetah.
- Good.
- What do you think, honey?
I-- I love it.
BB!
You know, "If it ain't broken,
don't fix it" is my motto.
- But it was broken.
- It wasn't broken.
- I don't want to kiss you.
- You told me--
I don't want to kiss
some old hag.
You told me
when I turned 40,
you'd trade me in
for two 20-years-old.
And because I had
the Fraxel--
I'm waiting for you to be 60
so I can get three 20s.
I got some good prospects
for getting some money.
It would probably be
my greatest achievement--
besides having all these
beautiful children--
would be finding the money.
I'm on a quest.
I want to spend
all that money...
that I'm going
to make in Vegas.
I'm going to buy
my yacht and my plane.
But you can't--
never get back
the two years
that I've lost looking.
I feel like--
almost like a guy
who is in jail
for a couple years.
You know, you never
get that back.
The big house-- you know,
I really don't want to sell it,
so I don't care
if I haven't had any bites.
I want to really finish it.
If I don't sell it, I'll keep it,
finish it.
Right, BB?
We're going to go live
in there someday, aren't we?
Hmm?
I'll live there and Jackie
can stay here, okay?
Just you and I
in that big house.
How about that, BB, huh?
Just you and me.
Every light in the house is on.
- I don't know.
- I've noticed that my dad's been
a lot more stressed out lately.
I never really
spend time with him.
Maybe you ought to go
look in my office
and see all the crap
that's on the floor in there.
Versailles...
is in default
with the bank.
What does that mean?
It means that
they started foreclosure.
But we'll work it out
before we lose it.
We'll figure out
a way to keep it.
So, do you want to have
dinner in the kitchen
or you want to have
dinner in here, honey?
Why are you in
such a bad mood?
I mean, all of a sudden,
I talked about it this--
I talked about it
this morning and--
Is it 'cause the front door
was open when you came home?
No, no.
You know what?
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna not pay
the electric bill this month.
When they shut off the lights,
then you'll all
appreciate electricity.
- Um--
- You all take everything for granted.
I didn't know
the front door was open.
Honey, maybe you need
to get a better,
like, hinge on the front door.
Maybe you should become
aware of your surroundings.
Well, we have, like,
a hundred doors in this house.
You didn't know all the lights
were on either.
They weren't all on.
All right, I'm--
I'm helping Victoria, um--
I'm teaching her how to make,
like, the shepherd's pie.
Do you mind
if I do that with her?
- Can I at least have a kiss?
- No.
You're mad at me
just from the front door?
All right.
Here, I'm going
to help you make
that shepherd's pie,
Victoria.
I-- why are you
going in there?
Why don't you learn
to turn off the lights?
Um, I was upstairs
in my room the whole time.
How would you like
to live without electricity?
I was in my room
the whole time.
There's so many people
in this house--
Okay, because that's
right when I went down
to make the shepherd pie,
the dinner that I'm making
for you and the family,
and you're being rude
to everyone.
Do you ever feel
like sometimes
you just want to spend
the whole day in bed?
And then when you work
and everything, you can't?
I think that's probably
how he's feeling right now.
You know, he just kind of
wants to escape.
And I don't know
what happened yesterday.
Victoria, it's not about
sticking up to him.
When people are mad
like Daddy just was--
- You know when you're frustrated...
- Oh, my gosh.
...it's the people that are closest
to you that you take it out on.
I tell my mom that a lot,
that she needs
to stick up to him.
She thinks that that would
just cause a bigger problem,
but I think that could,
like, resolve the problem,
'cause I think sometimes
my dad just needs
to be told that--
I don't know--
he's not the only one
who matters in the house.
How you feel
when he's mad?
How do you deal with that
when he's mad?
How do you deal?
How do you cope up?
I know it's nothing
that I did.
So, I mean,
I can deal with it.
- I mean, if I'm at fault--
- He's not mad at you.
He's just like-- he's like,
"Why is this--" you know?
He just wants to say something.
It wasn't even me,
so I know--
I wasn't the one
that left the door open.
I wasn't the one that
left the light on.
- Oh.
- You know?
I think my dad married my mom
as a trophy wife maybe
to, like, show her off,
'cause she's really pretty.
He doesn't act like
he loves her
the way he treats her
and stuff.
No, just tell him
how much you love him.
He needs to know that.
He's-- he had a bad day.
Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.
I love you,
Daddy.
He just wants
to say he loves you.
- He loves you.
- Thank you.
If you love me, you'll turn off
the lights when you see them on.
Well, we tried, honey.
Senator DeMint,
thank you so much forjoining us
from South Carolina.
And we'll certainly
be watching
his candidate forum
tomorrow.
Michael Gerson,
former speechwriter for
President George W. Bush...
- Are we getting near the end?
- Yes, we are.
We need to live
within our means.
Don't spend money
that we don't have.
Don't spend money
that we think
we're going
to eventually have.
Spend what we do have.
You know, get back
to reality.
I never expected
to live here.
I never expected Versailles.
I never expected a private jet.
I hope we can stay here.
I'm looking around now, it's like,
I'd better start taking pictures, huh?
For my memories and-- no, I don't
think we're going to lose our house.
But who knows?
Like, you probably know
more than I do.
Right? You spent, like,
an hour and a half,
two hours with my husband
this morning.
Like, we don't talk about
financial problems.
I guess I'll have to watch
the movie, right,
to find out what's going on
in my life.
Well, if I could
turn the clock back,
there would be a lot of things I would
have done differently.
Instead of having 28 resorts,
I would have had 15 resorts.
I kind of wish he never
took the mortgage out.
I mean, we owned all the land
and we just built the house.
I guess he was going to use
that money for Las Vegas.
It's a vicious cycle.
No one is without guilt,
and I'm the same way.
You know, they were
giving me cheap money
and I was using it to build
big buildings and buy more resorts.
And then when they stopped
giving me the money,
I'm suddenly, "Whoa,
how do I pay for all this?"
Okay, this could
go on forever.
Can we wind it up, please?
I didn't know the house
was in foreclosure.
I didn't know this whole process
was going on.
I didn't know we stopped
paying the mortgage.
This is all news to me.
I-- I didn't know.
I kind of wish
that I was more involved
because I'm not a stupid person.
But when you don't have
the information,
it makes you look stupid.
And without the information,
I mean, what can I do,
you know?
I guess I'm in this fantasy world,
you know?
Until reality hits.
But I have faith.
I'm here through
thick and thin
till the day we die.
And that's the only way
that I would ever leave him,
is if I died, you know.
If we had to buy just
a normal house,
like $300,000 house,
four-bedroom house or--
I would--
I would be fine with that
and make it work.
Just get a bunch
of bunk beds, you know?
I do enjoy this view here.
I mean, this is so peaceful.
I almost think I would love
just to spend
the rest of my life here.
I think this is wonderful,
having my private island.
