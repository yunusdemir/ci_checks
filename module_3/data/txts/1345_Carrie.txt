Help.
Help me!
Help me, Lord.
I'm dying.
What is this?
Cancer?
Mother Mary, full of grace, protect me
and guide me in my hour of death.
It's a test.
Cut it down.
Cut it down.
Shh.
Sue Snell
and Tommy Ross, come on.
Let's go, ladies!
In the water! Caps on, please!
Chris and Sue, let's go!
I want you to keep it
in the air three times. All right?
We are graduating, Ms. Desjardin.
Yeah, Sue!
Get that.
Don't be afraid of the ball, ladies.
All right, here we go.
All right, Carrie White.
Let's get Carrie into the game.
You can't stand
on the sidelines all the time. Come on.
Whoo!
Carrie's serve.
Yeah, Carrie White!
Do it, Carrie! Yeah, yeah.
Throw it. Do it. Serve it.
Oh. Ow.
What the hell?
It's so funny, Chris.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
You eat shit.
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.
No, he didn't. You're making it up.
He came up to me and I said,
"Well, you have to extend your hand..."
Now you're lying.
Help! Help! Help me!
Help me.
- Get off me, you freak!
- Please.
Oh, my God. Look what you did to my shirt.
Please!
Stop! Stop! Settle down.
I think I'm bleeding to death. Please.
Oh, my God. It's period blood.
I'm bleeding. I think I'm dying.
What? Oh, my God.
Please help me!
It's just your period.
Just plug it up.
- Help me!
- Oh, God!
Oh! She got you.
Help me!
God, just plug it up!
Help!
Plug it up!
I'm sorry. No!
No!
Plug it up!
Girls, come on! Move!
Ladies.
- Oh, my God. Okay. All right.
- Help me.
Okay, honey, stand up.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Help me, help me.
Oh, Carrie, come on.
Stand up.
Come on, can you stand up?
It hurts! It hurts!
It hurts! Something's not right.
Something's not right.
Okay, okay. What are you talking about?
Ms. Desjardin,
I don't think she knows it's her period.
No!
All right, Sue.
Get out of here! You're not helping.
- No! No!
- Calm down!
Everyone get out! Now! Out!
Okay, deep breaths. Come here.
Come on. It's okay. You're okay, sweetie.
It's totally normal.
Shh.
Do you know what it means?
Okay, sweetie.
Are you, uh, feeling better?
Can I get you some aspirin?
Some juice or something?
Juice? Really, Henry?
Maybe you just
want us to leave you alone.
Carrie, honey,
I am so sorry that I slapped you.
I should have handled it better.
It's totally normal
for young girls to get their periods.
It usually actually happens
a little bit earlier.
Is this your first time?
Honey, do you understand
what's happening to your body?
Do you know what it means?
What?
I don't know.
I felt something moving down there.
- Oh, honey.
- Whoa!
Maybe you could, uh,
talk to a counselor about that
or a nurse.
Um, what I need to know
is who started throwing...
...things.
It was Chris Hargensen
and all of her friends.
- Cassie...
- "Carrie."
Carrie, did Chris Hargensen start this?
Honey, you don't have to protect them.
What they did was unforgiveable.
Okay, uh...
It doesn't seem that Carrie
is going to point the finger,
so Ms. Desjardin,
I need you to get to the bottom of this.
Let the punishment fit the crime.
Okay.
Carrie, you're excused
from P.E. class for the rest of the week.
Just take study hall, okay? At the library.
Yeah. We're going
to have to call your mom.
What?
We're going to have to
call your mother, Carrie.
I know she's had
problems with us in the past,
ever since the state stopped her from
homeschooling you anymore,
but we've got to bring her into this, okay?
Mmm-mmm. No.
Sweetie, we have no choice.
- We have to tell your mom what happened.
- No.
Carrie.
Hey. Hey, you.
Tina, give it to me. Give it here.
This is brilliant. Look at this video.
<i>Plug it up!</i>
She got her period. On my hand.
That is so disgusting.
It was on my hand and Sue's shirt.
It was so disgusting.
Mmm.
I'm sorry you had
to come to school today, Mom.
Let's go inside, little girl.
You need to come inside with me.
Mama, why didn't you tell me?
I was so scared, Mama.
I thought I was going to die.
Mama, they laughed at me
and they threw things at me.
We'll talk about this inside, Carrie.
No.
I want to talk about it right here.
I don't want to go inside with you.
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie!
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie.
Oh, Lord, help my child.
She's lost.
Mama, stop it.
Mama!
I don't want to upset you.
So, you're a woman now.
And God made Eve from the rib of Adam.
- And what, Carrie? Say it.
- No, Mama.
- Say it.
- Talk to me.
- Please just talk to me.
- And Eve was weak.
I just want you to talk to me.
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?
And God visited Eve with a curse.
And the curse was a curse of blood.
I'm not going to say that.
That's not even in the Bible.
It doesn't say that anywhere.
Oh, Lord. Help this little girl
see the sin of her days and ways.
Show her if she had remained innocent,
the curse of blood would
not have come upon her as it did on Eve.
I'm not Eve, Mama. I didn't sin.
You showered with those other girls.
You had lust-filled thoughts.
Everyone has to shower, Mama.
Everyone. That's just the rules.
You must be different,
because He can see you.
I don't want to be different, Mama.
I want to be like them.
He can smell the sin on you.
And He will punish you.
I will not let that
come down upon you. I will not.
Lord have mercy.
No. "The Lord is good.
His unfailing love endures forever,
and his faithfulness continues
through all generations."
Psalms 100, verse 5.
I'm going to keep you
away from that school.
- You can't.
- We'll pray. We'll pray together.
To save our women-weak,
wicked, sinning souls.
You didn't tell me and they laughed.
I didn't sin, you sinned.
I did not.
I did not sin.
Go to your closet.
No, Mama.
Go to your closet and pray.
You pray.
No.
No!
No!
Get off me! Mama! Stop it!
- Go to your closet and
pray for forgiveness. - No!
- You pray.
- Mama! Help!
- No, Mommy!
- Come on.
Please! Help!
You pray, little girl.
Pray for forgiveness.
Mommy, let me go!
Let me out!
Mom!
God, you suck!
Help me. Help me.
What?
- I'm sorry.
- What?
Hey. What's wrong?
I really messed up today, Tommy.
What, that thing with Carrie?
You know about that?
Yeah, everyone knows about it,
but you're not responsible
for what Chris does.
Yeah, but it was me, too.
You threw tampons at Carrie White?
I kicked a kid in the ribs once.
Yeah, while he was knocked out.
Because this kid,
he used to beat the living shit out of me
every day in sixth grade.
Danny Patrick.
Did you apologize to Carrie?
Did you apologize
to Danny Patrick?
No, but we're not in sixth grade anymore.
Don't.
He was a dick to me.
What did Carrie White ever do to you?
Whoo!
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why he lost his license.
Then why are you still driving?
I don't need a license
if they can't catch me.
Jackie's email, Jackie's email!
Chris, no. No!
Wow. Why don't you two
kiss or something while you're at it?
Oh, baby.
Don't be stupid.
Wait.
Do you think we're going to get detention
because of that?
- Because that would suck.
- No.
They should be thanking us
for helping her through her first period.
I got her a tampon. So what?
You were only trying to help her, right?
We should post it.
No, I'm in it.
No one's going to see you, Teenie.
What? What are you doing?
Carrie White.
Favorite movie?
<i>Bloodsport.</i>
Favorite drink?
Bloody Mary.
<i>Brightly beams</i>
<i>Our Father's mercy</i>
<i>From His lighthouse evermore</i>
<i>But to us He gives the keeping</i>
<i>Of the lights along the shore</i>
<i>Let the lower lights be burning</i>
Did you finish your prayers, little girl?
Yes, Mama.
That's my good girl.
I love you.
I love you, too, Mama.
All right, stand up.
Line up, please.
You have a big week
coming up. A big month, actually.
Probably the biggest month of your lives.
Prom and then graduation.
Are you excited?
You probably all have your dresses.
You have your dates by now.
What about you, Chris?
Who's the lucky guy?
Billy Nolan. You don't know him.
He doesn't go to this school.
Are you going to get him a boutonniere?
Or are you just going to pin
a bloody tampon to his lapel?
I so don't need to hear this.
You're not going anywhere.
What about you, Sue?
Are you and Tommy busy campaigning
to be Prom King and Queen?
I would have voted for you.
Not now.
You all did a shitty thing yesterday.
A really shitty thing.
And one of you
had the audacity to post a video.
Somebody made a video of it?
This is bullshit.
That's it. Thanks to Miss Hargensen,
you're all running suicides.
I'm not doing it.
That's up to you.
That's up to all of you, but anyone
who stops running is suspended.
And if you're suspended,
you're not going to prom.
While you're running,
I'd like for you to think long and hard
about what it would be like
to be Carrie White.
I'll be okay, Mama.
I'm going to leave work early today
and pick you up after school.
She can't do this to me.
Just let it go, Chris. We're almost done.
Then every day this week?
All because of Carrie White?
Like hell I will.
Keep moving, Hargensen.
Keep running or you're not going to prom.
Fuck you!
This is child abuse.
What did you say to me?
I'm not going to run another goddamn inch
because Carrie White got her period
and was too stupid to know what it was.
- What?
- You're suspended.
You're out of prom
and you're out of my class. Now.
- No.
- No?
You can't decide that.
She can't do this to us.
Goodbye, Chris. The rest
of you, keep at it.
Someone could die of dehydration.
Tina, you have a heart condition, right?
If we all stick together,
they're not going to suspend all of us.
They're not going to keep us all from prom.
There would be no prom.
Nik, Lizzy?
Let's go, ladies!
Heather?
This is bullshit!
We didn't do anything wrong.
All right, let's go.
Right, Sue? You're with me on this, right?
Come on.
Sue.
Come on.
Keep going, ladies.
This isn't over.
This isn't over by a long shot.
That's Carrie White.
Um, you know... Sorry.
I was just going to say,
you can make it full-screen. Watch.
All right, who's next?
Uh, Carrie. Favorite poem.
Did you bring one?
Yeah.
Why don't you come to
the front of the class
and share it with us all?
"This unfrequented place to find some ease"
"Ease to the body some, none to the mind"
"Times past,
and what once I was and what am now"
"O wherefore was my birth
from Heaven foretold"
"Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight"
"Of both my Parents all in flames..."
"...ascended."
Okay, uh, that was, uh...
...disturbing.
That is the most
you've said in class all year.
Is there anything else you'd like to share
or are you done scaring us for the day?
Asshole.
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.
Did you say something?
I said, "Awesome."
I just thought
what Carrie read was awesome.
Didn't you, Mr. Ulmann?
All right, who's next? Uh...
Nicki.
I mean, Lizzy.
Is anyone working?
Excuse me.
Is anybody working?
Oh, Margaret.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I don't know where Hugo and Gloria...
Can I help you, Mrs. Snell?
Yes, I'm picking up.
Margaret, I want to say how sorry I am
about what happened at the school.
There's no excuse for what Sue did,
but she's a good girl.
Are any of those girls good?
Oh, that is beautiful work, Margaret.
Thank you.
I love what you've done with the neckline.
And the stitches. You can barely see them.
So few people can sew like this anymore.
I could never do anything like this myself.
Sue's going to look beautiful.
I am so excited for her.
I remember my prom.
Anyway, she's going to love it.
These are Godless times, Mrs. Snell.
<i>This gym teacher
was running Chrissie</i>
into the ground and used profanity.
I believe the term "shitty" was used.
She can't do that.
It's abuse of power.
You're right, Daddy. That's what she said.
"Shitty." She's really abusive.
Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded
for what happened in class today.
But you know we've had a lot of problems
with your daughter in the past.
And now, with what she did
to her classmate, Carrie White.
The girl was having her...
What your daughter and her posse...
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to half-truths.
I know my daughter.
She said she didn't do it.
I want her prom privileges restored.
You can't prove she did anything, can you?
I believe that there is a
video of the incident.
And I think
your daughter is the one who took it.
I think a video like that would probably
be pretty damning to anyone in it
and to the person who made it.
Don't you, Mr. Hargensen?
I don't know. I'm just a gym teacher,
but it seems like a video like that
would probably affect college admissions,
possibly a lawsuit, tons of bad publicity.
I wonder what <i>The Today Show</i>
would do with a video like that.
I think we should just look at her phone
and if it's not there,
I owe you a huge apology
and she should be allowed to go to prom.
Chris.
Chris.
Daddy,
I'm not going to give them my phone.
I have personal things on here.
Isn't that invasion of
privacy or something?
Chrissie, if you want to go to prom,
just give them the damn phone
and we can be done with this.
I have to get back to work.
Dad.
God damn it,
just give them your phone, Chris.
No.
So, I'm officially out of the prom.
I bet that cocksucker Morton
loses his job, though.
My dad is suing him.
Jesus, Sue, why didn't you stand up for me?
We could have had them by the balls.
We deserved it
for what we did to Carrie White.
I thought I deserved it.
Desjardin was right.
We did a shitty thing for no reason.
Bullshit!
That Carrie goes around saying
that everyone but her and her mother
are going to hell
and you stuck up for her? Come on!
You can be such a pig sometimes, Chris.
What did Carrie White ever do to you?
She's been begging for it
since the sixth grade, Sue.
I got to go.
I seem to remember you were in there
throwing shit with the rest of us.
What was it that she was calling her?
- "Freak"?
- I stopped.
Oh, you stopped?
- Yeah.
- Why did you keep running?
Hmm?
- Why did you keep running, Sue?
- Stop it, Chris!
You kept running, Sue, little Suze,
because you've been dreaming
about senior year
and the perfect boyfriend
and the perfect prom
your whole goddamned life.
You already booked the hotel,
already practiced the sounds
you're going to make
when you and Tommy make love.
That's why you had this
bullshit change of heart.
You don't give a shit about Carrie White.
And everybody knows it.
Okay. I'll see you around, Sue.
Carrie?
Carrie?
I'm not going to let
anyone hurt you, little girl.
You're safe here with me.
Got it.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Good.
- Good?
- Yeah.
- What's up?
- I want you to take Carrie White to prom.
Good one, babe. Come on.
Are you serious?
I'm just trying to fix what I did.
Yeah.
I get that, but this is...
Sue, it's nuts.
Okay, so it's nuts.
But after what we did to her,
I have to do something.
I have to do something that counts.
Uh...
What even makes you think
that she would say yes to me?
She'd say yes.
We've barely even spoken.
I saw how she looked at you in class
when you rescued her.
What girl doesn't want to go to prom?
What girl doesn't want one magical night?
Maybe I can give that up for her.
No. Babe, I want you
to have that magic night.
I don't want to go to prom
with Carrie White.
I want to go to prom with you.
I can't go.
Hey, Carrie.
I was looking for you at the library
because that's where they said you were.
But, uh, you weren't there,
so I figured maybe you were here.
<i>"Telekinesis: Unlocking the Mind. "</i>
No, no.
Is that about, uh, hypnosis?
Because me and my friends, we tried that.
We actually hypnotized my boy's dog.
Anyway, um...
How are you doing?
I'm okay.
Cool.
So you know how, um, prom is next week?
You know?
Um, I was wondering,
if you don't have a date already,
maybe you want to go with me.
What?
The prom. Next week.
Carrie.
Hey.
- Carrie.
- Stop!
Please, just stop trying to trick me.
No, I'm not trying to trick you.
I'm not tricking you.
Aren't you with Sue Snell?
Yeah, I'm with Sue Snell,
but she doesn't want to go.
I'm sorry.
Did one of the girls try something again?
No.
I got invited to prom.
Really?
That's great news.
With who?
It's Tommy Ross.
Wow. Tommy Ross?
He is pretty dreamy, huh?
Yeah.
I know who he goes around with.
They're just going to trick me again.
Right?
Maybe he really meant it.
No.
Yes, of course he did.
Why?
Why would he want to go with me?
Come here.
Do you know what I see?
I see a beautiful young woman.
Maybe wear a little make-up.
Pinch your cheeks a little bit,
put some color in there.
Curl your hair.
Stand up straight.
There you go.
<i>Come on, Sue.</i>
You and Chris are best friends.
If you two...
If you three are planning on playing a joke
on a lonely, defenseless girl...
This has nothing to do with Chris.
Or you, Miss Desjardin. And for me...
Listen, with due respect,
Miss Desjardin, this is between Sue and me.
It's kind of like a private thing.
And what is the big deal anyway?
It's just for one night, right?
Famous athletes like Tim Tebow,
he takes kids to prom all the time
and everyone loves him for it.
Really?
You're hardly a famous athlete.
This is a really big deal for her.
Listen. It doesn't matter.
She said no.
- So you'll try again.
- Don't.
- Okay.
- It's not okay.
Tommy,
when you show up to prom
with Carrie White on your arm,
don't you think you're going to look
the tiniest bit ridiculous?
We don't care how we look. Do we?
No.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
Aren't you going to ask me in?
What do you want? You can't be here.
Right to the point, huh?
Cool. About the prom.
You kind of left me hanging.
I already told you.
I know, but I was hoping
that you'd change your mind.
Girls change their mind all the time.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.
You need to leave.
I'm not leaving until you say yes.
Why is this so important to you?
Because I think
that we would have a good time.
And because I think
that what you read in class was cool.
I looked up that book
in the library myself.
That's the guy who brought
the temple down. Samson, right?
Yes.
Yes, okay, I'll go.
I have to be back by 10:30.
Sure, okay. Um...
I'll pick you up here at 7:00?
Okay.
Crazy, right?
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.
Where have you been?
I was worried sick. Come on. Come inside.
- I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.
- Just get inside.
Your supper's cold.
I'm going to have to heat it up.
I didn't know...
You're immodest.
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know.
No, Mama. I took a bus to Main Street
and I bought cloth for a dress.
You are not to go anywhere
but to school and back. You know that.
Mama, before you say anything else,
I've been asked to prom.
Mama, I've been asked to prom.
Oh, God, why?
It's next Saturday and
he's a very nice boy.
And he'll come and meet you before
and he promised to have me home by 10:30.
- No, no, no.
- I already accepted.
I know this scares you.
It scares me, too.
The other kids,
they think I'm weird.
But I don't want to be.
I have to try to be a whole person.
Before it's too late.
He'll hurt you.
No, Mama.
No, Mama, there are bad people,
but not Tommy.
He's good.
You'll like him. He's a very nice boy.
Boys, boys. After the blood,
comes the boys sniffing,
slobbering like dogs.
Stop it, Mama.
He's going to paw at you until he finds
where that blood smell comes from.
He's going to take you, Carrie,
in his car out to the wilderness,
out where it's cold
and the roadhouses are and the whiskey.
Stop being so crazy.
You tell that boy you're not going.
No.
We'll move from here.
We're never going to stop moving.
You're going to go to your closet
and you're going to pray.
You're going to get in there
and you're going to pray for forgiveness.
No, never again, Mama!
Mama, stand up.
Mama, stand up!
Mama, I'm going.
- Witch.
- I'm not a witch, Mama.
There are no witches.
The devil's got her now.
Like he did before.
It's not the devil, Mama.
There are other people out there like me
who can do what I can do.
You poor child.
Don't you know he's working through you?
Mama, it's inherited.
It was passed down from Grandma
and it skipped you.
You know that. Maybe it came from Daddy.
He gave me a cancer.
I thought you were cancer.
- That's awful. Don't say that.
- She's lost to me.
Pray all you want, Mama, but I'm going.
And nothing's going to stop me.
And I don't want to talk about it anymore.
What are we doing?
What does this have to do
with Carrie White?
Baby, you said
you wanted us to do something about her.
It's a piggy!
Here, piggy, piggy.
Here, piggy, piggy.
It smells like shit in here.
Chris, pick one. Pick one
that looks like her.
Pig's blood for a pig.
That one.
Go on.
One quick swing, all right?
I got this.
Don't worry, little piggy,
Uncle Jack is going
to bash your head right in.
You're not going to feel one...
Shut up! Do it already. Jesus.
I can't.
God, you guys are such goddamn pussies.
Shut up!
I'm sorry, Billy.
Come on, you got this.
All right, it's just one quick slice and...
Oh, my God.
Good job, baby.
Sue. Hey, are you okay?
There we go.
Billy. Hurry up.
Oh, my God.
When the time comes,
I'll let you pull the rope, okay?
Oh, I plan on it.
Did you guys see Sue today?
She looked awful.
I know Chris isn't coming.
She's suspended.
Do you think she'll crash?
You never know with Chris, right?
So, I think I'm going to
have the after-party.
No.
- What do you think?
- Down?
No.
Yeah.
Whoo!
Will you pin it on me, Mama?
Red.
I might have known it would be red.
It's pink.
I can see your dirty pillows.
Everyone will.
Breasts, Mama.
Breasts. You have them
and every woman has them.
Take off that dress, Carrie.
No.
Take it off and we'll burn it together
and pray for forgiveness.
Mama, it's modest.
Call that boy and tell
him you're not going.
You just tell him you're sick.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Or you could just be happy for me.
Mama, stop hurting yourself.
You know it's not going to make me stay.
He's not coming. It's a trick.
Same as always.
He's going to come.
They're going to laugh at you.
They're all going to laugh at you.
Mama, stop it.
I'm nervous enough as it is.
Thank you, sir.
You see, Mama?
You see, it's all going to be okay.
Oh, repent. It's not too late.
Mama, don't ruin this for me.
I'll be home early.
I'm going to have to
tell that boy the truth
that your father took me
and you were born of sin.
- You'll say nothing, Mama.
- And from that sin...
From that sin was born another.
The worst sin.
"A man or a woman who is a witch
among you is to be put to death."
"You are to stone them."
I'm warning you, Mama.
The devil's hand.
Please don't do this.
There will be a judgment, Carrie.
As Jezebel fell from the tower, you too...
Mama, you're not going to say
another word until I'm gone.
Mommy, I'm sorry.
I love you.
I'll be home early.
Hi.
Hi.
Do I look okay?
You look beautiful.
Tommy, can we wait a minute?
Yeah, sure,
we can wait as long as you want.
Are you scared?
They're not that bad.
Besides, I need you in there.
Dancing by myself all night,
I'd look awful silly.
Here, let me fix this.
I think this is supposed
to go on your wrist.
There.
Are you ready?
God, you look handsome, Ross.
Dawson!
Don't worry. If they kill each
other, I'll dance with you.
Carrie, this is my best buddy,
George Dawson.
And this is his girlfriend, Erika.
She goes to Dover.
Hi.
Come on, I'll show you the table.
I love your dress. Where did you get it?
I made it.
No kidding. Really?
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.
Do you want to dance?
Or, if you want,
we could wait for a slower song.
Yeah.
I'll be back.
Miss Desjardin.
You look beautiful.
I'll let you two ladies talk.
Uh, do you want some punch?
I heard Greg and Harry spiked it.
Really?
No, I'm just kidding.
You're doing okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Listen.
Do you really have to be home so early?
I promised.
Yeah, I know. I understand.
But, um, a bunch of people,
we're going to the Cavalier after.
- That's okay.
- What is?
I know you want to hang out
with your friends, and that's...
No.
It's a slow song.
No.
Yeah. Come on.
No, Tommy. I've never danced before.
- It's okay.
- No, I can't. I can't do it.
You can't go to prom
and not have at least one dance.
I can't.
Carrie White,
will you have this dance with me?
Come on.
Come on.
It's so easy.
Take this hand in my hand. Like this, see?
You're going to put this hand
on my shoulder.
And I put my hand on your hip.
Then we sway.
See, it's easy.
You've got nothing to worry about.
And you're good, you're a good learner.
And then, if you want to get fancy with it,
we can do the <i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>
- Yeah.
- No.
Yeah. Ready? Look.
To the first one.
This is fun, right?
Tommy, why am I here?
Because I invited you.
But why?
Carrie, we're here.
We're at prom.
I'm having such a great time with you.
You are?
Yeah.
And I hope
that you're having a good time with me.
Yeah.
So, what do you say
we dance a little longer,
and then we see which poor fool
they crown King and Queen,
and then we go to the Cavalier?
And I'll have you home by 10:30.
How does that sound to you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Maybe 11:00.
Whatever you want.
11:00.
<i>All right, everyone,
take your seats. Take your seats.</i>
<i>It's now time to vote for your King</i>
<i>and Queen of the prom. All right.</i>
<i>Ballots are on the table.
Everyone gets their own, please.</i>
<i>Guys, take your seats.</i>
Here.
<i>Make an "X" beside
the candidate of your choice.</i>
<i>Let's have the best prom ever.</i>
<i>Whoo!</i>
<i>All right.</i>
Tommy, we're on here.
Don't you want to be on there?
Do you?
Why not?
If we win, the only thing that happens is
we have to go up there on those thrones,
wave a scepter around
while they play the school song,
and then, uh, do a little dance
so everyone can see how idiotic we look.
They are beautiful.
You're beautiful.
So, who do we vote for?
I guess they're more
your crowd than mine.
I don't really have a crowd.
Well, I think we vote for ourselves, right?
No. No, don't vote for us.
To the devil with false modesty.
To the devil.
- Hurt yourself?
- No.
To my boy, George Dawson,
to the Fearsome Four,
Mike, Matt, Brian, and Brad.
I'm going to miss you guys.
- All set?
- Oh, yeah.
Good luck, kids. You've got my vote.
More ballots for you.
Hey, girl.
Here you go.
As soon as that bucket goes, we run.
We don't stick around for the laughs
or the screams or anything.
All right?
You got it?
Are you listening? Hey.
- What?
- When they get up there,
what's happening?
You're pulling the rope and when the...
- Shut up so I can hear.
- Hey. Listen to me. Listen.
If you get caught
and you say anything about what we did,
I will fucking kill you.
This isn't what
you bitches did in the shower.
This is criminal assault.
This is fucking jail time if we're caught.
I get it.
Hey. Whatever happens tonight,
you're Queen, okay?
And the results are in.
And it was very, very close.
A drum roll, please.
By one vote, our winners are...
Tommy Ross and Carrie White!
Come on.
Way to go, Carrie.
Heather, where's Chris?
What are you talking about? She's not here.
Hey, what's wrong?
Come on, go. You can do this.
We are fucking doing this.
It's too late to go back now.
Ewen High...
I give you your newly crowned
King and Queen of the prom,
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.
- Pull it!
- Shut up, Billy!
- Chris.
- Sue?
Sue.
What are you doing?
Come on. Come on, let's go.
No! Miss Desjardin, it's not me.
It's Chris.
Pull it, Billy, pull it!
Don't ruin this for Carrie.
- It's not me!
- Come on. Out.
- Let her have this.
- No, wait!
What the hell?
<i>Plug it up!</i>
<i>Please help me!</i>
<i>Plug it up!</i>
Carrie, wait. Carrie.
<i>Help me.</i>
<i>No!</i>
<i>- Freak! Freak!
- Come on.</i>
Carrie, come on.
Tommy.
Tommy.
Tommy, no.
No.
Fuck.
You have an inch.
Yeah. Come on.
Go, go. Come on.
- Come on.
- Are you seeing this?
- Wait.
- Come on.
There's been an explosion.
Don't panic!
Bleachers!
We have to get to the door.
Nicki!
- Lizzy!
- Nicki!
- Come on! We got to go!
- Okay.
Tina, come on!
We're all going to die!
Come on!
What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Do you think this is a fucking game?
Shut up.
What are we going to do?
We're going to leave town
and we're never going to come back.
Okay? It's okay. It's going to be okay.
Okay.
Oh, my God! Watch out!
Shit town!
Go, move!
Oh, my God.
It's Carrie.
Run her down.
Kill her.
Kill her, Billy. Kill her, Billy! Kill her!
Shut up! I got this.
Come on!
Billy?
Billy?
Billy?
No.
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.
Mama?
Mama?
Mama?
Mama!
No.
No.
No.
I'm so sorry.
Mama?
Mama?
Oh, Mama.
Mama, you were right.
They laughed at me, Mommy.
They all laughed at me.
I knew they'd hurt my little girl.
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.
We slept in the same bed,
lived together sinlessly.
Then one night,
I saw him look at me in that way.
And we got down on our knees
to pray for strength.
And that's when he took me.
No, Mama. I don't want to hear it.
- And I liked it.
- Mama, no.
I should have given you to God
when you were born, but...
I was weak.
And I loved you so much.
And I said, "God,
let me keep my little girl."
"Let me keep her."
Let's pray.
Yes, Mama.
Yes, we'll pray.
I'll be the preacher.
You'll be my congregation.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name."
"Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done
on earth
as it is in heaven."
Mama!
Mama, please.
No, Mama. Mama, please.
This isn't your fault, Carrie. It's mine.
- Mommy, this isn't right.
- You know the devil never dies.
He keeps coming back.
You've got to keep killin' him.
- No, Mama.
- Over and over again.
Mama, please. Mama!
No!
No, Mama.
Mama, stop it!
- Carrie.
- I'm sorry.
Carrie!
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay. No one's going to hurt you.
No one's going to hurt you.
Carrie?
Let me help you, Carrie.
Why couldn't you leave me alone?
I'm sorry.
Look what you turned me into.
Don't hurt me, Carrie.
Why not?
I've been hurt my whole life.
I killed my mom.
I want her back.
I'm scared.
We've got to get out of here!
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on!
- It's a girl.
- What?
You don't know?
Oh, my God.
Get out!
Get out!
It's okay.
<i>Miss Snell,
we're trying to determine the exact role</i>
<i>Carrie White played in the tragedy
on prom night.</i>
You would agree that you were under
an enormous amount of stress.
Isn't it possible
that what you saw was a natural act?
My boyfriend,
most of my friends, died that night,
but I know what I saw.
<i>You want an explanation?</i>
<i>Carrie had some sort of power,</i>
<i>but she was just like me,</i>
<i>like any of you.</i>
<i>She had hopes and she had fears.</i>
<i>And we pushed her.</i>
<i>And you can only push someone so far</i>
<i>before they break.</i>
<i>I can hardly make you mine</i>
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>
<i>At the end of a long day
and when I wake</i>
<i>If you could just give me a sign</i>
<i>We could leave it all behind</i>
<i>Stop taking the long way before we play</i>
<i>I don't think I can make it
and I know you're the one</i>
<i>Staring into the tears like a loaded gun</i>
<i>Well, I can hardly make you mine</i>
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>
<i>But you never wanted, but you had to take</i>
<i>So I can never give you up</i>
<i>I guess it's 'cause it's just a crush</i>
<i>Before the end of a long
day and then I wake</i>
<i>But I know you're not the one or the only</i>
<i>But we both know what
it's like to be lonely</i>
<i>Well, these fantasies, they left us lonely</i>
<i>Boy, just bring all your love back to me</i>
<i>I guess for now this is how it'll be</i>
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>
<i>Staring into the tears like a loaded gun</i>
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>
<i>Staring into the tears like a loaded gun</i>
