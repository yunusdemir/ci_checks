Why do I always get the shit
end of these assignments?
I'd like to ask
that question.
What the hell
were you expectin', Bobby? Waco?
Very funny.
Well, they say it's not the heat
but the humidity that fucks you up.
Wouldn't be so bad if I could
find my lighter. You guys have it?
Your lighter, Bobby? Nah, I ain't seen
your lighter. You seen his lighter?
- Nah. No.
- Did you lose somethin' again?
This is Browning.
Listen, Johnson, if you idiots
don't keep this channel clear,
I'm personally gonna come out there
and light you both on fire.
What's he doing?
Well, looks like
he's still waitin'.
Yes?
Oyeme. It's gonna be
4:00 a.m. Closing time.
You bring what you got.
We'll bring what we've got.
No. No, I bring nothing
until I see what you got.
You show me first.
Shit!
Goddamn it!
- What the fuck was that?
- Let's just slow down.
We're in a stolen car.
What? Could you
say that again?
You see, I'm having a hard time
hearin' ya 'cause the alarm
blew out my fuckin' eardrums!
I don't want to risk
going to jail for nothing.
Well, jail is exactly
what I'm tryin' to avoid.
You know, Milo, at this point,
I'm so disenchanted with you,
so why don't you shut the fuck up
and let me make the decisions?
All right, all right.
You want to hang yourself, go ahead.
I got some more rope
back here if you need it.
This is Cowlings.
Suspect is on the move.
Copy that. A.T.F., keep me advised.
Going to his car.
- Holy shit. I think he saw me.
- What the fuck?
Where's he goin'?
What the fuck? Where'd he go?
- What's goin' on?
- He's not gettin' in his car.
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What the fuck? Where did he go?
- Aw, shit. Oh, fuck, man.
- Okay, okay, okay.
He's leavin', but it looks
like he changed cars.
- He's in a different car.
He's in a Lincoln.
- It's a Lincoln.
- Nah, nah, it's a... it's a Buick.
- Goddamn it. Check that. It's a Buick.
What the fuck is it?
A Buick or a Lincoln?
I don't know.
Some big, old gas guzzler.
We'll see it when we get down there.
We're on our way down, all right?
I got him.
He's comin' right at me.
We're on our way, Bobby.
You still got him,
Johnson? He's going straight?
If it ain't my lucky day.
Bobby, come in. You there?
I didn't know there'd be guards.
You're the alarm guy.
I leave that shit up to you.
- Christ. What was that?
- The ground. We hit the ground.
No, no. Not that.
Somethin' else.
Hey, Bobby, which way did he go?
Bobby, you over there?
Come in, Johnson.
Eh, I guess he found
his smokes.
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. There he goes.
There he goes!
There he goes. Move!
This is Special Agent Cowlings.
We need backup.
I got an agent down
on the corner of LeMonde and Main.
Send a medic ASAP. I am in
vehicle pursuit of suspect. Over.
All right.
This is Browning. We're on the way.
You're on LeMonde?
Oh, now, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, what?
- You ready for this?
- You mean hearin' things
he's gotta say, then no.
No. I ain't ready
to hear shit from him.
Jesus. I didn't know you could say
that many words in a row.
Ooh. Does that smart mouth
bite too? Betcha it don't.
- All right.
- Betcha it don't.
Oh, there's
someone comin' up on us.
He's movin'.
- I think it's a cop.
- I don't see no flashin' lights.
Shit.
We just made a left on Corelli.
He's not slowin' down.
Rear ram?
- Down here. Let's go down here.
- What's down there?
Fuck if I know.
A place to hide.
Uh, uh, w-we're
closed, sonny.
He tripped and fell
and bumped his head.
He needs to use your bathroom,
if it's okay.
Your friend needs
an ambulance.
Hey! Hey! Put your hands
where I can see them. Now!
Hey! Hey, you!
Get up. Get up!
Put down that cue.
Okay. Lock it.
Get up on the table.
Hey, shit face, sit down.
Sit down.
Now, you listen up.
Here's the news.
Nobody moves, nobody says anything,
nobody's gonna get hurt.
We're only gonna be here
for a couple of minutes.
You just relax.
Drink your beer.
Drink it.
Enjoy your evening.
That's easy for you to say. You don't
have a gun pointed at your head.
Hey. I said
everybody be quiet.
Especially you.
- Where's your bathroom?
- Over there, where it's always been.
Come here. Take him
in the bathroom.
Try to clean him up.
Now, when they get out
of the bathroom,
we're gonna leave you booze-hounds
to your drunken lives.
For now,
you just sit tight.
- What do I owe you for this?
- It's free. Just take it.
The last drink's
always on the house.
No, look, I want to pay
for it. How much?
- Two bucks.
- Two bucks? For a lousy beer?
You gonna pay for it or not?
Big-time gangster like you ought
to be able to cough up a deuce.
Did I do something to you
in another fuckin' life?
Keep the change.
You are
a big spender. I like that in a man.
Now, I just don't know what
it's gonna take to make you shut up.
If you don't bite,
then don't bark, doggy dog.
- Hey!
- Shut up!
Look, we don't want no trouble.
You don't want
no trouble, huh?
Then everybody
keep fuckin' quiet.
Hurry up.
Mr. Cool, huh?
Mr. Quiet?
Well, let me tell you
something, Mr. Quiet.
You being quiet tells me
that you're smart,
and smart people
sometimes fuck things up...
by trying to be clever.
Now, I hope...
that you're not smart
and clever...
'cause then
we got a problem.
Now you're gonna rob me?
The day just keeps gettin' sweeter.
Rob you? Kinda.
What, you don't have a car?
- I don't drive.
- You don't drive?
- Then how do you get
to work every day?
- I take the streetcar.
Sir.
I've got a car.
It's a-a green Chevy station wagon.
It's parked right outside.
Outside?
Station wagon, huh?
Chicks must flock to you
in a car like that.
Hey, you can take my car.
B.M.W. Smooth and fast.
Parked just
up the block.
Think I'll take
the beemer. Sorry, kid.
Whoa.
Just put the phone
up on the bar.
Hello.
No, this ain't Dino.
Yeah, sure.
- Who's Dino?
- That'd be me. It's my place.
No, he's,
he's busy right now.
Okay, Dino, your wife,
or your girlfriend,
or whatever the fuck
you want to call her,
wants to know if you
still need a ride home.
Don't you fuck
with me.
Oh, can't blame a guy
for tryin'.
Yeah, I just talked to Dino
and he said he doesn't need a ride home.
He'll be leaving
any minute.
Oh, me?
I'm just a friend.
Uh-huh. Oh, it was nice
talking to you too.
Bye.
She seems like
a really nice lady.
Does she know you're a no-good,
lyin' sack of shit?
Sure does.
Back up.
Shit.
Yeah.
Put him down. Help me.
Get me a stool.
Keep an eye on them.
Damn. Shit.
Check that door.
What's back here?
Huh?
What's through here?
Fuck!
Where's the back way?
- Ain't no back way.
-  Ain't no windows either.
- No windows? What?
-  You're in a basement.
Place was sealed during
prohibition. No other exit.
- Ain't that illegal?
- It is if you don't fix the police.
Well, your fuckin' friends
are outside.
Unplug that line.
We gotta barricade
this door.
- Mark.
- Yes, sir?
- Where's the report on this man?
- It's being faxed over, sir.
I want a sound team
in the warehouse above the bar,
sharpshooters
on the buildings west and south,
and blueprints for all
the buildings in the area.
- Get these goddamn cars
towed out of here.
- Right.
- You got 'em?
- It's just ringing.
What do you mean, it's just ringing?
Where's my megaphone?
In the trunk.
You want it now?
No, tomorrow. Yes.
Now, goddamn it!
Get down from there.
Don't you want
to talk to them?
Not yet. I mean, fuck!
What's goin' on?
Huh? We've only been
in here for five minutes.
Seems like a month
of Sundays to me.
What now?
Give me that!
Wait a minute!
You want to know what?
I'll tell you what.
Get outta here...
Miss Janet Boudreau,
1329 Parkland Drive.
Female.
Born February 6, 1956...
My ass!
Five foot seven,
120 pounds.
Yeah.
Organ donor.
Let me tell you something,
miss donor bitch.
You don't know me, right?
But now I know you, right?
Like where you live.
Now, you keep
your mouth shut...
or you're gonna be "donin'"
a lot sooner than you thought.
As a matter of fact,
come out from behind that bar...
and sit in that stool
where I can see you.
Come here.
1329 Parkland Avenue.
Just forget her, okay?
I want you
to keep an eye on these people.
Hey, look. I'm trusting you
with this, okay?
Browning here.
No, sir, we haven't been able
to make contact with him yet.
Yes, we're sure
he's there.
There's a blood trail that led from
the accident all the way to this bar.
Yes, the two men are dead,
as well as Agent Johnson.
Looks like he just ran
them down with his car.
No. No way he could
have survived.
No, I won't make a move
until you get here.
Should have got married
when you had the chance,
had kids,
settled down,
got a job.
Who you kiddin'?
Come here.
Can I go to the bathroom?
Not now.
Okay, give me the gun.
Here. Give it to me.
Okay. I'm gonna send those pigs
out there a little message.
Want me to get you
some paper?
- What?
- You're gonna write to them, right?
No. I'm not gonna
write to them.
I'm gonna fire off
a round,
showin' them
that I'm serious,
that I don't give a fuck
about nothin'...
and that we don't mind
playing hardball.
That ain't hardball. Hardball'd be
killing one of the things in here.
Whoa, whoa.
Hang on a second.
We ain't gonna
kill nobody.
- It's a trick.
- Well, it's pussy league.
No, no, no. It's a ploy,
and that's the plan. Okay?
- Suppose they storm in?
- They're not gonna storm in.
Look, these guys,
they got procedures.
Okay? They're not independent
of thought and action, like us.
They, they got a book, and they gotta
follow it right down to the last letter.
Come on. We're the...
We're the ones who refuse to conform
to the dictates of the group,
and we got them
right where we want them.
An extensive investigation began
about three weeks ago when
a message was intercepted...
saying that the suspect would be
traveling to New Orleans in two weeks...
with $65,000 suspected
for the use of buying guns.
The Montreal police has been contacted,
but nothing has come through,
although the one guy that I did talk to
in the Montreal office...
said that this guy
was never known to be violent.
All I see is feet, boss.
That's all you gotta see.
- You watchin'?
- Yeah.
I can't believe there's
no back exit in this layout.
Shit!
Aaaaah!
Dino!
- Put down your fuckin' gun!
- Don't be stupid.
Nobody walks into my fuckin' bar
and pulls this shit.
Put it down, or I'll redecorate my bar
with your friend's brains.
- No, no, no. Come on.
- Put it down!
- No!
- No!
You ain't such
a fuckin' tough guy now!
We don't know for sure anyone died.
I've been told to sit and wait.
- Who told you?
- Michaels.
And do you know what
he really wanted to know?
He wanted to know if the media
had arrived. Can you believe that?
Uh, ex... Excuse me?
Y-Y-Your friend, uh,
he's, he's awake.
Milo.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What's goin' on?
- You okay?
He's okay.
Where are we?
Milo!
You want a smoke?
Just some basement bar.
Take one out.
Take one out.
Put it in my mouth.
Put it in my mouth.
You're something else.
- Anything broken?
- I don't know, man.
Everything.
God!
Damn!
Menthol.
I hate menthol.
I know.
The ape shows restraint.
- I'd go toe-to-toe, but since
you're so much smaller...
- Hey! Enough already.
What are you doin' provoking him?
We got other problems.
I'm already
bleeding here.
- You want to bleed some more?
- All right!
Maybe after
your nose is better.
Would you just keep
an eye on these people?
Or better yet,
frisk them.
Oh, no. You are not
gonna touch me.
- Hey, leave her alone.
She doesn't have anything.
- She sure does, boss.
No, she doesn't.
Check the boy.
Don't cut yourself
with it.
Oh, don't you worry about that.
I know how to use it.
I'm good
with my hands.
Hey, come here.
Come here.
Give me the knife.
Don't waste your time
fuckin' with this guy.
He's nothin'.
If you blow on him, he'll fall down.
Come on.
Give me the knife.
Don't fuck with that guy.
Here. You keep it.
Where was I?
Sit over there.
Over there.
Have you talked
to the cops yet?
Fuck, no.
I unplugged the phone.
Look. We gotta...
We gotta stall 'em or somethin' so
they don't come bustin' in here...
before we can figure out
what we're gonna do and how
we're gonna get outta here.
We need to...
We need to bluff 'em or something.
I ain't talkin' to 'em.
Can't let him talk to 'em.
Why don't you let one of us
talk to them for you?
Who the fuck are you?
Guy. M-My name is Guy.
- Sir, may I ask a question?
- No.
Sir, are we sure that
that's him in there?
I mean, we don't really
know for sure now, do we?
- I got him back on the line.
- You got him?
Give me that.
Say again? No, no, no, no.
Wait. Slow down.
Just say it again.
I am a hostage,
and am in great danger.
If you ever want to see me
or any of the others alive,
you must comply
with our demands.
First, remove all
police personnel...
from the street
in front of the bar.
If this is not done
in one hour,
one of these people
will die.
That is all.
Guess what.
She ain't kiddin', you know.
Prison ought to suit you
just fine.
Goddamn, that's sick!
Making a hostage
send that message.
What about the demand?
He knows we ain't gonna leave.
He's buying time.
Hey, you, altar boy.
You want to make us some coffee?
- Do I look like your bitch?
- Come on, man. Just make it.
I never made coffee before.
My mom always makes it.
Your mom? What, does she come over
and make it for you every day?
No, not every day. Every fuckin'
other day. You got a problem with that?
Me? No. Fuck it, man.
I'll make it.
No. We got to talk.
- Alone.
-  What about Mr. Quiet?
We can see him
from here.
- ... Again, but, uh...
- What?
May I go to the bathroom?
When was the last time you let
these people go to the bathroom?
What am I,
the bathroom attendant?
Hey, you think we could listen
to some Johnny Paycheck?
- No!
- Woman is suffering.
Let her go to the bathroom.
Look, no more music,
no more questions,
and no more
fuckin' interruptions.
All right, hurry up and get
your ass in the bathroom.
You ready now?
More than ready.
You said there's
no back exits, right?
Yeah. We checked it out, man.
There's nothin'.
Well, Lowell, there's got to be
another way out of here,
if this was a speakeasy.
Drinkin' was illegal then,
you know,
so the cops would raid
these kind of places.
Everybody's got to get
out of here fast,
and the cops are coming in
through the front...
so they got to go
out the back.
- What, through a wall?
- Look around at this place.
This guy treated this bar
like his baby.
He does his best
to preserve it the way it was.
- He doesn't change a thing.
- I still don't see no exit.
You don't hear
what I'm saying.
They're hidden.
So what do we do,
some fuckin' voodoo dance?
Rub a fuckin' lamp,
and the shit just opens?
Maybe. They don't exactly blueprint
this kind of stuff.
Could be anywhere.
Just got
to check it out.
We can't exactly
ask the bartender.
She might know. Hey.
- You feel better?
- Better?
Yeah, you know, just...
Never mind.
Look, you work here,
right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Did, uh, Dino ever say anything
to you about a hidden exit?
No. I never
heard of one.
- And you say you work here?
- Yeah, I work here; for ten years.
But just 'cause
I work here don't mean...
Hey! Lip is what
I don't need.
I asked you
a simple question.
I happen to know
that this used to be a speakeasy,
so you, y-you think hard.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.
Now...
you're sure that you don't remember
him saying anything about, uh,
another way out
of here?
You think I'm hiding
something from you? I mean, I'm...
"Hiding"? We never said anything
about hiding nothin'.
- That's what you're thinkin'.
- Hey, shut up and answer me!
Hey.
I know what you're looking for.
Dino showed me
one night.
Just leave her alone.
How far does this thing go?
I don't know.
I didn't fuckin' dig it. Ow!
Just go sit down.
You don't have to do that now.
Wouldn't have
to do anything...
if you all hadn't
come in here tonight.
We're gonna be gone soon.
Don't worry.
I think the one
with the gun is crazy.
Crazy and a gun
tends to make me worry.
He's not gonna
do nothin'.
What about you?
You got a gun too.
So?
But you're not
gonna use it,
are you?
I don't want to talk
anymore, all right?
That... That other one...
You seem like you got
a good heart in there somewhere.
The other one's boxed in.
Uh, he's scared.
Men do stupid things
when they get scared.
Look, why don't... Why don't you just
keep your opinions to yourself.
Okay?
Sure. Sure.
It's just...
you're smarter
than he is.
You don't want to be
a part of this, do you?
Look, please just, don't you think
you could get him...
to let us go,
before he gets us all killed?
I mean, he's...
he's in over his head.
He's, he's, he's acting
like a...
Oh, he's acting like
an idiot.
Hey, shut up.
I don't care how smart
you think I am.
You're talking
about my brother.
Just go...
Just go sit down,
all right?
I meant no disrespect.
Oh, fuck.
- Jail ain't an option, you know.
- Yeah, I know.
You better be
fuckin' serious about that.
- What do you think? You think I'm...
- No, no, no, no.
I don't think Milo's
got it in him.
Yeah? Well, don't you
worry about Milo.
Milo's thinkin' of a way
to get us out.
I'm thinkin'
all the time,
and I'm thinkin' I ain't goin'
back to jail no matter what.
So those people out there,
I say fuck 'em if we have to.
You with me on that?
'Cause I don't think he is.
Look, when push comes
to shove,
I'll fuckin' shove.
You know me.
Listen to me!
I will not let anything
happen to him.
Do you understand me? I'll do
whatever it takes to convince him,
but I will never
hurt him.
It's okay about the tunnel.
Don't worry about it.
- What time we got?
- Twelve before 6:00.
All right, kid,
scram.
We gotta talk.
It's okay. Go on.
Thanks for the napkins.
Now, look, their hour is almost up.
Uh, excuse me, but before
you guys start your meeting,
can... can I please go
to the, uh, the...
Huh? Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
Keep an eye on him,
will you?
Uh-huh.
How much time?
About five minutes.
I want that call made
not one second after the deadline.
- What's up with the back door?
- There isn't one.
- What?
- Here.
The blueprints show
the building was built in the '20s.
Believe it or not,
there are no other exits.
What, they didn't believe
in fuckin' fire codes in this city?
Figures. And the rest
of the surveillance?
Nothing.
Still deaf, dumb and blind.
Well, let's go make that call,
hear what he wants.
I can't tell, but it looks clear.
Good.
Oh, whoa! Shit!
They're pulling something.
What'd you expect,
they were just gonna leave?
This was a good-faith request.
What's gonna happen,
I'm gonna really start making demands.
Fuck!
- Think we should let them
get away with this?
- Show them who's boss here!
They think we're
clowning around!
I say we whack one of these people
for real, man. No more bullshittin'.
Jesus Christ. Don't listen to him.
He's a fuckin' sociopath.
- What good would that do?
You'd still have to get out.
- Shut up.
- Hey, you show the lady
a little respect.
- Uh-oh! Big man!
Look, everybody shut up.
You need a plan.
Talk, talk, talk.
That's all I'm hearing.
I mean, fuck,
you have to get out now.
No more waiting.
- He thinks so too.
-  What?
Were you talking
to this guy?
I didn't say jack shit to him,
but he's right.
And I guess they're all
geniuses, right?
And I guess that
makes me the idiot.
Well, fine, then why don't you all
figure this shit out...
because all I seem to be doing
is fucking everything up.
Calm down.
Just take it easy.
We got to listen.
Okay.
Plan. I'm listening.
Tell them you will
let go the hostages, one by one...
and instead of releasing us,
release yourselves.
Yeah.
We, uh,
pretend we're
the hostages.
Then, uh,
tie us up...
and, uh,
be gone
before they come in.
What do you think?
Hey, I'm a sociopath.
You know what I think.
We gotta make some demands.
Then, each time that they
give us something...
we give them a hostage.
Nobody gets hurt.
And then when they're waiting
for the final demand,
we get the hell out of here.
Yeah.
Where?
I don't know.
Mexico.
There's something missing.
- I say we take the kid.
- What?
He'd be like
an insurance policy.
You think these people
are gonna talk if we got the kid?
I don't think so.
- I want to go.
-  See?
- He wants to go.
- Yeah, if it'll make things easier.
No. Look, I'll go.
I like that.
No way. The kid goes,
and that's it.
If anybody is gonna go,
it ought to be me. L...
You've been nothing but a fuckin'
headache since we walked in here,
so sit down.
- Huh?
- What? No, I won't
say a thing about the kid.
I'll be too busy describing your face
to the police sketch artist.
Nothin' better go wrong,
'cause I just don't know
what I'd do if it did.
No, no, nobody want
no coffee.
Uh, bring me some water
over here, would you?
- Oh, my God. Here they come.
- Who? Goddamn it.
I'm surprised it took them so long.
Well, they're here,
so we better deal with it.
Oh, check that.
You deal with them.
What do you want me
to tell them?
Tell them shit.
Tell them nothing.
Say "No comment."
I don't care.
No, no. Uh, let me talk to them.
I know what to say.
What the fuck?
You're not ready yet?
Come on, come on.
Jesus Christ.
I'd like to get this shot
before the sun comes up.
Fuck it. Geez.
I'm working with Gilligan.
- Excuse me. Are you in charge here?
- Yes, ma'am.
Hi. I'm Jenny Ferguson,
Channel 7 Action News.
I was wondering if you
wouldn't mind...
answering a few questions
on camera for the morning report?
No, not at all.
Great.
Excuse me.
That would be great.
Okay.
You ready?
I'm sorry.
What was your name?
Browning.
G.D. Browning, A.T.F.
Browning. Okay.
Excellent.
Okay? We're ready?
Okay.
Hello. This is
Jenny Ferguson.
I'm standing out here on
Townsend Street, near the south docks.
It appears that an unknown
gunman, or gunmen,
has taken some people
hostage in a local bar.
Now, there has been reports
of gunshots.
Apparently it all began
after 4:00 this morning...
and has continued
until now.
Standing with me here now
is Agent Browning of the A.T.F.
Agent Browning, can you shed some light
on what's been happening here?
Well, it looks like
some goddamn stupid motherfucker...
has decided to take
some poor, innocent fucks hostage.
We've been out here
all fuckin' night...
trying to deal with
this goddamn situation,
but there hasn't been
a fuckin' break yet.
But we're sure as shit hopeful
that everyone will be safe...
and that we bring
this motherfucker,
or motherfuckers, as the case may be,
to fucking justice.
How's that?
What are you doing?
You got the seven. Right here.
- I can't make that.
- What do you mean?
- He's got the three.
- No, no. The three's stymied.
- No, it's not.
- Milo, please. It's blocked.
You can't see it from there.
It's completely blocked.
You got to go
with the seven.
It's your only shot.
Bank it right here.
No, no, no. You got to hit it
bottom right, here.
All right, line it up.
Take your time.
Get down. Like that.
Got it?
Uh-huh. Good shot.
Don't listen to him.
It was a good shot.
It was your only shot.
It would have gone in except this,
uh, this cue's a little...
No, yeah.
That was a tough one.
I'd say there are
tougher things in life, kid.
Yeah, I guess.
It's your shot.
I ain't got nothin'.
- Albo gator it.
- What?
Albo gator.
Albo... what?
You never heard
of an albino alligator?
No.
What the fuck is that?
Down here we got
gators, right?
But every once in a while,
one of them little things is born white.
An albino.
He's weak...
and useless,
Sacrifice.
The other gators will use him
to gain new territory.
They send him out in the open,
just waitin' to get him killed,
'cause when some
rival group of gators...
shows themselves in the open,
killing the albo gator,
they surround and kill
their rivals.
No more albo gator,
but no more
rival gators neither,
and new territory
is definitely gained.
Deliberate sacrifice...
for deliberate gain.
That's a weird fuckin' story,
you know that?
Just park that white ball
in front of his pocket...
so he don't have
a shot either.
Albo gator him.
Isn't it almost time?
What time we got?
6:15.
There.
It's albo gatored.
Hey, miss secretary.
Hurry up.
It's almost show time.
Hurry up.
Puttin' on
your makeup?
This ain't TV, you know.
It's radio. Come on.
Could I talk to you
for a moment?
- We got deadlines.
- I know. It'll just take a second.
Please?
All right. Hurry up.
Make it quick.
I'd like to apologize for the things
I said when you first come in here.
Oh. All right.
- It's about the kid.
- Yeah? What about the kid?
Well, just, let me
tell you about him, okay?
He comes in here a lot.
Plays a lot of pool.
I ain't never
seen him win.
There's this one guy, right?
A regular. Plays him all the time.
He's a hustler, okay? I mean, everybody
knows he's a hustler, except the kid.
The kid thinks, you know,
it's luck.
Guy's made a lot of money
off him.
Lady, this means
nothing to me.
Just wait a second, now.
I'm not finished yet.
- You know how Dino said
he paid off the cops?
- Yeah.
I don't know if that's true,
but we've had cops...
in and out of here
all the time.
You know? I mean,
they know Dino. They know me.
Now, if I go out there
with you,
and I tell them
you're my friend,
then you are my friend,
okay?
I mean, they'll believe me.
Hmm?
How's that sound?
I'm still listening.
If you take the kid
out there...
They don't know the kid.
I mean, they're gonna
question both of you, separately.
Kid's family
is gonna be there.
Hard enough to lie
to the police,
let alone
your own family.
I mean,
the kid will crack.
I know
what's at stake here.
I won't crack.
Well, you haven't
cracked yet.
Right.
Now, that's what I mean.
I mean, you can't take
a kid out there.
You need someone
who knows the score.
Someone who's more mature.
Well...
I'II, uh,
I'll think about it.
Okay.
Thanks, Bill. I'm standing out here
on Townsend Street...
- Turn up the volume.
- What?
- The volume, turn it up.
- I saw that clicker.
- I can't figure it out, boss.
- I'll get it.
All I can say is we're involved
in a hostage situation...
that would involve our commitment
to being here...
in joint investigation with
the New Orleans Police Department.
- Can you confirm the rumored deaths?
- I can't comment on that.
We've heard that two or three agents
have been injured or killed.
Like I said, no comment.
All I can say is...
we're involved in a hostage situation,
doing everything we can...
to make sure everyone
comes out safe and sound.
Thank you, Agent Rose,
for your time.
Details are sketchy right now,
but we have an unconfirmed report...
that at least two officers
have been killed.
- Reporting live from
Dino's Last Chance Bar,
- All right.
- This is Jenny Ferguson
for Channel 7 Action News.
- Okay, turn it down.
- Back to you in the studio.
- Kid, from now on you're
in charge of the TV set.
When the news comes on,
turn up the volume. Got it?
Can I get my coat?
I'm cold.
Yeah, all right, kid.
Three dead cops.
They're gonna call any minute.
Are you ready with the note?
Sure. Yeah.
- How about you, kid? You ready?
- I thought you said that...
I know, I did.
I'm takin' him. So just, shh.
- What about what we said about me...
- Enough! Enough!
- You read the notes, he comes with me.
- But I know them!
You understand?
No more. No more!
Hey, kid, you're doin' the right thing.
You know that, right?
- What's your name?
- Danny.
All right, Danny. Go over there
and sit with the rest of them.
No, that's great,
but even if it's probably right,
there's no way to confirm that.
I don't think we should run that,
going out on a limb like that.
You know what? Fuck it. Run it.
No, run it. Run it.
Guys, this is a great story.
If it's wrong, we'll retract it.
- Make sure she reads this word for word.
- All right, read this.
"Here are the demands.
There will be
no negotiation.
First, an empty bus,
with all the windows
painted black,
must be driven onto the sidewalk
in front of the bar.
Once in place,
the driver must exit...
and no one else
will be on it.
The bus must have
a full tank of gas.
A small jet must be
waitin' at the airport.
It has to have enough fuel
to travel 3,000 miles.
There must be no tricks.
If any of these amends...
demands...
are not met exactly
as they are presented,
a hostage will die.
For each demand that is met,
one hostage will be released."
Very good.
I want to talk to you guys.
We ain't gonna really
kill anybody, right?
Nah.
Why?
- Say it.
- Say what?
We ain't gonna do it.
Yeah. We won't.
You swear
on Mom's grave?
On Mom's grave.
- We ain't gonna
really kill these people.
- Yeah. Right.
- Now you.
- What?
I want to hear you say
those exact words.
- We won't.
- Swear it.
- I don't like swearing on my mother.
- Come on, just say it.
- Come on...
- Do it!
I swear on my mother
we ain't gonna whack no one.
'Less we have to.
Well, the plane is definitely a no-go.
Fuck the plane;
he ain't even gonna reach it.
You and the chief
agree on that one.
He doesn't want him
up in the air, either.
By the way, he has
some other ideas too.
He does, does he?
He's gonna sit there in Washington...
in his comfy chair and tell us
to comply with all the demands.
Well, fuck that.
I tell you this:
One more fuckin' gunshot goes off,
and we're going in.
Game over;
good guys win.
I'm gonna nail him
before he gets on the bus.
4:00 a.m. Closing time.
You bring what you've got,
we'll bring what we've got.
No, no. L-I bring nothing
'til I see. You show me first.
- Holy shit. He saw me.
- What? What?
Let it ring.
We said what
we're gonna say.
Hey, turn it up.
The siege has been going on for
over two hours and there seem
to be no breaks in the case.
All I do know is that demands
have been made by the gunmen,
but no report has been made
about what those might be.
We do have an exclusive but unconfirmed
report of the identity of the man...
who is holding these hostages.
His name is Guy Foucard,
a Canadian citizen.
- He's a wanted, known gunrunner
who apparently...
- What the fuck?
Get 'em up!
- What, that... that's me?
- Guy Foucard, huh?
I don't know what the...
- Suspected gun dealer?
- My name is not "Guy,"
my name is "Ghee."
I am not the man
they say they want.
- Your picture's on the fuckin' screen!
- Yes!
"Ghee," "Guy,"
who the fuck are you?
The photo is me!
The photo is me, but...
But, I mean, fuck, l...
- Maybe he's a cop trying to trick us.
- I am not a cop.
He's not a cop. He was in here
long before this went down.
- Right!
- It's somethin' else.
- What? No, nothing.
- I knew something was wrong.
I never liked your idea.
If he is a cop, I say
we waste him right fuckin' now!
- He's not a cop. He's got no gun.
- Right!
He's a liar, tryin' to set us up,
tryin' to frame us!
- All right, listen to me,
listen, listen.
- Okay.
- Tell us who you are
and what you're doin' here...
- Yes. Yes. Okay.
Shut up!
And why you're wanted by the Feds.
Or my friend here's gonna start
breakin' your fingers. You like that?
- Talk to them!
- Shut up!
- They were here!
- Shut up!
Okay, yes.
- You gonna tell us the truth...
- They know me.
Hey, shut up.
Tell us the truth.
And if your story doesn't jibe,
he's gonna keep breaking your
fuckin' fingers, you got me?
- Okay, but these people...
- Aw, fuck it.
Break one!
Milo, stay out of this. Go sit down.
- I want him to start talkin'.
- Okay, okay!
I'm telling you, I don't...
This... I am not...
I am Guy Foucard,
yes, but... I mean,
I am here for business.
I work for the government
of Quebec.
In the morning I go to Mexico City
for some meeting.
I have free time before the plane,
so I come to this bar.
And these, I know these,
they know me.
I come here, l...
Fuck, I mean...
An old movie was on TV, and,
too bad for me, I stay to watch it late.
Was this guy
in here watchin' TV?
He's not a regular, so I didn't pay
much attention, but maybe he...
What ya do that for?
- 'Cause he's a fuckin' animal.
- Fuck you, Milo!
The TV was on mute.
He couldn't have been watchin'.
- Wait! Wait!
- He's lyin'.
Whoa, whoa, you're right.
Don't do that 'til I tell you.
- What did you say that for?
- What? What?
- The fuckin' thing wasn't even on!
- L... I don't...
How it was, I was watching,
I don't know, I remember that...
Speak fuckin' English!
The fucking movie was over
when you guys come in here.
It was sport news,
I think it was...
- Sport news?
- I think so.
- Any sports shows on that late?
- There's one on channel 9.
Right.
I think that's the one.
- But he wasn't there that long.
He came in before...
- He's a fucking drunk!
Right.
- Fuck!
- That's enough, goddamn it!
Milo, stay the fuck out of this.
Some things you're good at;
this ain't one of 'em.
Okay! Okay!
L-l... The police...
The police are
looking for me!
Is that what you w...
I mean...
Throw me out there, then. I prefer that
to bein' with you fucking guys!
Listen to me!
Doesn't matter
what he says.
That's the guy
they say they want.
Who gives a shit?
It doesn't change the plan.
- Aaah!
- Let him go.
- Hey, let him go!
- Aaah! Wait, wait!
Why are you doing this?
Aaah! You must listen to me!
- Aaah!
- Let's go.
- Inside.
- Get in there.
Get the fuck
in there!
You have to listen to me! Please!
I can help you!
We gotta stick
with the original plan.
You gotta go
to the hospital.
They're not gonna let you
walk outta here, they're gonna
take you to the emergency room.
- For God knows how long.
- Long enough to get us busted.
I am innocent!
You have to listen to me!
Will you shut him up?
Milo, please.
We've been given
the fuckin' key, man, a gift!
A solution
to our problem.
No, man. What the hell
are you talking about?
- They got evidence.
- What evidence?
They-They got the car.
The car was stolen.
We say that... this guy stole a car,
he got in an accident,
he killed
the fuckin' bartender.
We could smash his face and make it look
like he was in an accident!
What about these people?
Don't you...
You think they're gonna just forget
what really happened in here?
- Don't you think that's a problem?
- What do you want me to do?
Just give up?
Well, fuck that.
I see another way
out of this.
The only way out is for us
to pretend that we're hostages.
I got a bad feelin'
about that plan.
We gotta do somethin' else
or we're gonna get nailed.
It's not gonna be long before
they put two and two together
and figure out what went wrong.
We gotta walk out
of this thing scot-free.
Forget the airport, forget jail,
forget fuckin' Mexico.
We gotta walk
outta here free men.
You see?
Milo, you should go to
the hospital without bein'...
afraid of gettin' nailed.
You should go
to the hospital...
a hero.
Yeah.
- A fuckin' hero.
- Johnny-fuckin'-Paycheck
wouldn't run to Mexico.
We ain't
Johnny Paycheck.
We got witnesses
who will talk.
Albo gator 'em.
What did you say?
Sacrifice
for our gain.
I didn't want
to say it...
but that's what
I was thinkin' too.
Best kind of outlaw...
is a free outlaw.
Where did you get that information,
and why did you show that picture?
- You know how dangerous that is?
- I'll call you back.
If you don't tell me where you
got that from, I'm gonna run
your ass from the scene.
- You can't do that.
- Wanna test me?
- Marv! Run this fuckin' news...
- Okay. All right.
I got it from Montreal,
from a source there.
I know his name,
his m.o., everything.
- You know we won't confirm this.
- You just did.
Gimme the gun.
Huh? Why?
Just gimme the gun.
Where you goin'?
- Where you goin'?
- You ain't gonna do it.
- Gimme a fuckin' break.
-  No!
Goddamn it!
You swore, man,
on our mother...
that you weren't
gonna kill anybody.
Things have changed.
They don't want us, they want him.
I'm not gonna
let this happen.
- Milo, give me the gun.
- No.
- Give me back the fuckin' gun.
- No, no.
- Give me the fuckin' gun!
- No!
- We got things to do.
Are you with us or not?
- Go fuck yourself!
- Hey!
- Aaah!
- Enough!
- We don't have time to deal
with this fuckin' shit!
You promised me
you'd see this through,
no matter what
your brother said.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yeah. Right now? Okay.
They're going in
in 15 minutes. Come on!
All right.
It's happening.
Where the fuck
is he off to?
Where you goin'?
I don't want any part
of this, so...
I'm turnin' myself in.
Don't make me
fuckin' do it.
I'm gonna get us
outta this.
Get the fuck out.
- Come on, let's go.
- Get the fuck out!
All right!
- Go!
- Jesus!
- You're a fuckin' liar, you know?
- Quiet!
- You're gonna kill us. Please don't!
- Please!
No!
- No!
- Quiet!
Boss?
- Boss?
- Huh? What?
Why'd you do this?
Why?
I wasn't gonna shoot you.
Why? Why?
Come on.
Come on,
I'm gonna get you outta this.
Come on. Did you actually think
I was gonna shoot you?
I was gonna get us out of this.
All you had to do was
shut your fuckin' eyes.
Come on.
You can't do this.
Oh, God.
Please,
please make him stop.
You can't do this.
Listen to your brother.
He was right.
You can't do this,
you can't be a part of all this...
- This murder!
- Shut up!
- Hail, Mary, full of grace...
- Stop fuckin' prayin'!
- The Lord is with thee...
- Stop it!
- Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed...
- Mom.
Is the fruit of thy...
What did you say?
He's my boy.
My boy.
Danny and me
won't say nothin'.
We won't say nothin',
you know, about what's
happened here tonight.
Jack said he would talk,
but we didn't.
A-And we won't.
We won't.
We won't say
anything.
- Right, Danny?
- Right.
Right.
Please.
Your brother...
Your brother said
this was wrong,
and he couldn't do it.
I swear.
I swear.
- You wanna live?
- Yes.
That's not
good enough.
N-No... Why isn't it enough?
Please.
You gotta mean it.
You two wanna live...
then you do it.
Do it.
Oh, my God.
There's been a gunshot
at Dino's Bar and Grill.
Okay, this is it.
Go in now.
And yes, there's been lots of gunfire.
Looks to me as if people
are coming out now.
- Cut back to the studio.
I'll be back to you, Phil.
- What happened inside?
Are you happy with
the way the A.T.F. Handled this?
How does it feel
to be a hero?
- What?
- I asked you how it feels to be a hero.
He's not a hero.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean by that?
I think what he means is...
that... none of us are.
Tell us what happened.
I'm so happy to see
that you're alive and well.
We're gonna get you
to the hospital.
An ending to this siege that began
between 2:00 and 4:00 this morning.
We still do not have
an official death toll,
but there are
three survivors.
She may say none
of them are heroes,
but a lot of us
feel differently.
With three survivors
out of seven hostages taken,
they were certainly all heroes to get
out of this situation alive and well.
No one but them knows
what that was like.
