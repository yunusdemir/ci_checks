People once believed
that when someone dies...
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.
But sometimes,
something so bad happens...
that a terrible sadness is carried
with it and the soul can't rest.
Then, sometimes...
just sometimes...
the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.
Hey, Sarge!
Yeah?
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?
Nobody.
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.
- All right, guys, let's do it.
- Devil's fuckin' Night.
- What's the count so far?
- 143 fires.
- They're slacking off from last year.
- Three hours to go.
- Maybe they're just slow starters.
- Coming through!
Yeah, I remember.
But you guys just can't come in here
and take her away like this.
There are procedures to stick by.
You guys should have
cleared this with me first.
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.
- We found her, Detective,
and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.
I didn't give the order
to move her.
Jesus, Albrecht. I can see why they
took away your gold shield.
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.
All right, clear out of here.
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.
Tell him to take care
of Sarah.
Look, I will. You just, uh,
lie back. Come on, come on.
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, look. Your sister...
she's gonna be okay.
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.
She's my friend.
Her and Eric.
- You lied to her about Eric.
- Look, I had to.
And you're lying
to me about Shelly.
She's gonna die, isn't she?
Hey, uh...
Now, come on.
Come on, it's okay.
She's gonna be fine.
A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.
I used to think
that was true about everything...
families, friends, feelings.
But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...
two people who are meant to be
together... nothing can keep them apart.
Later.
What are you,
like the night watchman?
You know, what
this place needs...
is a good natural catastrophe.
- Earthquake, tornado, you know.
- No, no, no, no.
Mickey, come on, man. You... You got
to put the mustard underneath first.
Maybe a flood
like in the Bible.
Hey, hey, hey, let me do it.
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?
Come on. Come on, man.
Don't cheap out on me. Lots of onions.
- All right, here you go.
- Hey, all right.
Now we're talkin'.
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.
- How do you steer that thing
on a wet street?
- Pure talent. Hi.
See, now, Sarah, she's a genuine
hot dogger. You hungry?
- You buyin'?
- I'm buyin'.
- No onions though, okay?
- No onions?
They make you fart big time.
You know, Lake Erie
actually caught on fire once...
from all the crap
floating around in it.
I wish I could have seen that.
Fire it up! Yeah!
- Fire it up! We busted their machines!
- Shit!
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T-Bird, cop car, cop car.
Bad people out
on the street tonight.
- Damn it!
- Oh, my God!
- What was that?
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.
Mickey, call it in for me!
Gabriel!
- Eric?
- Department of Housing!
Code violations?
Safety hazards?
Place looks fine to me.
Let's redecorate.
"Abashed, the devil stood...
and felt how awful goodness is.
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."
It's pornography.
Virtue?
Shelly?
- No! Eric!
- See ya!
No, no, no, no, me first.
Please.
- Shelly.
- Eric!
- Hey, that's good.
- That's good.
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?
Look at that.
Look at that.
Here's to Devil's Night,
my new favourite holiday.
To Devil's Night.
You just go over there
and tell your pals...
You sick fuck.
Are you out of
your motherfuckin' mind, man?
Look at that!
Pussies drink last, man.
- Fuck you, Tin Tin.
- Hey.
That shit ain't even loaded, man.
This one is.
Which of you Motor City
motherfuckers...
wants to bet me
this one isn't?
Hey, fire it up!
Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Here's your shooters.
Put your guns away, huh, guys?
- How ya doin'?
- Pussycat.
Boo.
- I love you.
- Say that again.
I love you.
Oh, boy.
Restaurant.
- Wow, you look great.
- Ta-da!
Yeah.
- Come here!
- No, no, no, stop!
<i>Just paint your face</i>

<i>Dreaming the crow-black dream</i>
<i>Dreaming the crow-black dream</i>
- Couple more rings. That's 24K.
- 24K, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- It's 18K. It's crap.
It's probably fake.
Leather purse. Leather.
Geez. Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?
A blood stain that's on here?
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.
Now, you,
take it or leave it.
Right there for ya.
Decisions, decisions, yes.
You cheap ass, chrome dome...
child molestin',
saprophyte motherfucker.
- Close the gate when you go out!
- Oh, I closes up for you...
real good, massa.
Fuck you.
Yeah, sit on it and twirl,
you dirty scum.
Lucky I don't stab
your fat ass.

What the fuck you all painted
up for, crackhead, huh?
Halloween ain't till <i>mañana.</i>
Come on.
I'll cut you!
Fuck you, murderer!
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!
- Man, what the fuck you want, man?
- I want you to tell me a story.
A man and a woman
in a loft a year ago.
- You're out of your motherfucking mind...
- Listen!
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them on Halloween.
Yeah, yeah, right, Halloween, yeah.
Some dude, some bitch, whatever, man.
Her name was Shelly.
You cut her.
You raped her.
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shanked
her pink ass and she loved it!
Murderer? Murderer? Let me tell you
about murder. It's fun!
It's easy.
You gonna learn all about it.
I'd like you to meet
two buddies of mine.
We never miss.
Try harder. Try again!
Victims. Aren't we all?
<i>Sometimes it rains</i>
<i>inside my head</i>
<i>When the words run dry</i>
<i>And the walls are breathing</i>
<i>Hands are...</i>
- Look at this mess!
What's the world comin' to?
- Yeah, it's a mess.
<i>No, they don't</i>
<i>have to take you</i>
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.
<i>No, they don't</i>
<i>have to take you away</i>
- Get out of my way, you worms!
- <i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>
Give me some of that
over there!
Why don't you ladies
come by later? Check me out.
Hey, guess what.
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.
- Boom.
- Can you imagine that? It's tragic.
Gather your soldiers. You're on
for tomorrow night. No sweat.
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.
You're thinking
about the past.
Dad gave me this.
Fifth birthday.
He said childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.
Is she asleep?
I think we broke her.
I love her eyes.
Pretty.
<i>No, they don't</i>
<i>have to take you away</i>
Hey, kid, get the hell
outta the road!
<i>I don't hate them</i>
<i>But I know them</i>
<i>I don't want them</i>
<i>hangin' 'round</i>
<i>I won't roll my bones</i>
Don't fuck with me.
I told you to stay out of here.
So I guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?
She's busy. Go play with
your dolls or something, okay?
I don't have any dolls.
- Get some food, huh?
- Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.
"Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police."
Thirty, I go 40 dollars.
And 20 from 60...
Who the fuck is this now?
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!
Go sleep it off
somewhere else, dusthead,
unless you want to get mutilated.
Always got to dick off.
Goddamn creatures of the night,
they never learn.
Hey! Hey!
"Suddenly I heard a tapping,
as if someone...
gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door."
What are you talking about?
You heard me rapping, right?
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fuckin' new door!
- I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.
- Yeah?
- Gold.
- You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit on me!
Shit on me.
Shit on me!
Mr Gideon.
You're not paying attention.
No! My hand!
I repeat,
a gold engagement ring, yes?
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.
- Who's this sack of shit?
- That's Tin Tin, one of
T-Bird's little helpers.
I think you can rule out
accidental death.
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?
This could be a turf hit, but it
doesn't look like your usual gang crap.
Oh, come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.
I'm supposed to thank you
for that, right?
Word to the wise:
Watch your fuckin' mouth.
What the hell
do you call that?
I call it blood, Detective. I suppose
you'll write it up as graffiti.
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?
- Don't you know this game?
What game are you talking about?
Okay, the rings.
I'll tell you about the rings!
They're in that-that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!
Take... Take the fucking rings out! You
can choke on them, you son of a bitch!
- Look, it goes up to the attic.
- Okay.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.
Shelly.
I love you.
- You have one chance to live.
- Look, man, take anything you want.
- Thank you.
- Take anything!
Now you're going to tell me
where to find the rest
of Tin Tin's little party pals.
The Pit. They all
hang out at the Pit.
All of T-Birds's little potato-heads
hang out there. And Funboy,
he lives there upstairs, all right?
- Funboy.
- Oh, baby, oh.
- Shit!
- A whole jolly club...
- Stop! Stop! Please!
- With jolly pirate nicknames!
- Stop! Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still.
Each one of these is a life...
a life you helped destroy.
Look, I'm begging you, all right?
Don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Your job will be to tell the rest of
them that death is coming for them...
tonight.
Tell them Eric Draven
sends his regards.
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.
You're nothing but street grease,
ya hear that... street grease,
you motherfucker!
- Is that gasoline I smell?
- No, man, no. No!
No! No!
It's on the house, kiddo,
you know that.
One root beer.
I can't do anything.
Your mom, technically,
she's off right now.
Yeah, way off.
Police! Don't move!
I said, "Don't move!"
I thought the police
always said, "Freeze."
I am the police and I say don't move,
Snow White. You move, you're dead.
And I say
I'm dead and I move.
Not one more step.
I'm serious.
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun? You high?
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?
Shelly Webster's dead,
my friend.
I want you to move over
to the kurb there. Go on,
real nice and easy. Come on. Move it!
Okay, we're gonna
wait here for backup.
- It's gettin' too friggin' weird for me.
- Oh, it gets better.
Do you know someone
named T-Bird?
He had a friend who shouldn't
have played with knives. Like the coat?
You're the guy
that murdered Tin Tin.
- Hey, check it out.
- He was already dead.
He died a year ago,
the moment he touched her.
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.
Get away from there!
Cops! Come on!
Get outta here!
Leave it, leave it! Run!
Oh, great, great.
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell and you
lose him right out in the open.
Well, at least he didn't do that walking
against the wind shit. I hate that.
- Little early for Devil's Night.
- What the hell is going on, man?
You are very restless.
Just wish I was a little
hungry again, that's all.
- Be careful of what you ask for.
- Yeah, you may get it, I know.
There are energies
aligning against you.
Seeing is believing,
isn't it?
Mmm, yummy.
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down
to the foundation.
Nobody cleared this
little event with me.
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.
Well, sure.
You must be awful disappointed.
I got trouble. One of
my crew got himself perished.
- Yeah, and who might that be?
- Tin Tin.
Somebody stuck his blades in all
his major organs in alphabetical order.
Gentlemen, by all means, I think we
ought to have an introspective moment
of silence for poor old Tin Tin.
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good. That's very reassuring.
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?
Call it my need to know.
Let go, you creep!
Nah.
You need to slow down,
you dickhead!
- He couldn't have stopped.
- He was a buttface.
I could have made it.
- What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?
- Sometimes.
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?
Don't thank me. Are we
fighting the good fight?
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.
Annie, look at that.
"We, the undersigned tenants
of 1929 Caulderon Court Apartments..."
- What is this, a petition?
- A big "kick me" sign...
for a very nice girl who found herself
a cause and the cause got her killed.
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighbourhood?
Miss Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.
You know, the last time
you went snooping around on a case is
when you got put back on the beat.
- Yeah, I know.
Torres keeps reminding me.
- Oh, I bet he does.
You're going to wind up
working a school crosswalk.
- I'm cool.
- You didn't get that file from me,
okay? And don't tell me you owe me one.
Ah, I owe you one!
Yeah, right.
Damn.
Tomorrow night, we can...
we can get high...
and watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.
<i>I am the park</i>
<i>I am glow</i>
<i>In the motherfuckin'dark</i>
<i>I am shocked</i>
<i>And I see</i>
<i>I don't want to believe</i>
<i>No more</i>
- There's a big fuckin' bird over there.
- <i>No more</i>
Huh?
- <i>No more</i>
- It's a squab.
Come here, bird.
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.
Bird. B-B-Birdie.
Here, birdie, birdie, birdie,
birdie, birdie, birdie.
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie,
birdie, birdie, birdie.
Birdie? Hey, birdie?
Here, Funboy.
What the fuck?
No, man! Don't do that! You nearly
gave me a fucking heart attack!
Look at him.
Don't sweat it.
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?
You need professional help.
Bingo!
He shoots. He scores.
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ?
Stop me if you heard this one.
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.
Ow.
He hands the innkeeper
three nails and he asks...
Don't you ever fuckin' die?
"Can you put me up
for the night?"
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Yes, it fuckin' hurts.
Oh, God.
Look what you've done
to my sheets.
I've got a gun
in my pocket.
You're happy to see me,
aren't you?
Stay away!
Stay away from me!
Look.
Mother is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.
If I wanted ice, I would have
asked for ice! Now fill it up!
Fill it up yourself,
macho man.
I really need this.
All right.
- You burn yourself playing with matches?
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.
- This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?
Get my friend here
a glass of blood.
- Hey, hey, hon!
- Hey, good night, Darla.
You stay put right there.
Get away, steamhead.
Shh.
<i>Well, as you can see,</i>
<i>I'm here on the corner of 27th Street</i>
<i>and East Washington Place...</i>
<i>the site of last year's biggest</i>
<i>Devil's Night conflagration.</i>
<i>It was exactly one year ago</i>
<i>that the building you see</i>
<i>across the street from me...</i>
<i>was totally demolished by fire.</i>
<i>The fire that was fought</i>
<i>by seven fire companies, but cost</i>
<i>the lives of two fire fighters.</i>
<i>In fact, if it weren't</i>
<i>for the constant surveillance</i>
<i>by the local police precincts...</i>
Freeze!
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.
Fuck.
- Good likeness.
- I saw your body, man.
You... You died. You got buried.
You still have your hat on.
I gotta sit down.
Holy shit.
Say...
are you some kind of... of ghost?
Boo!
I don't know what I am. I need you
to tell me what happened to us.
Well, you took a six-story
swan dive out of a window.
She, ah, was beaten and raped.
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.
I mean, come on.
Read the file.
Shelly Webster held on
for 30 hours in intensive care.
And her body finally
just gave it up.
I saw it, man.
I-I couldn't do jack for her.
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!
Hey.
- You okay?
- I saw her.
I saw her through your eyes.
You stayed with her the whole time.
Yeah, well, you got
to understand something, all right?
I was... I was hoping
she'd come out of it, you know.
Uh, give me something
I could work with.
Yeah. Look, I...
Why didn't you do
something about it?
You think any of those people
in that building... even the ones
who signed the petition...
would talk after
what happened to you?
I kept asking questions and...
finally got busted for sticking my nose
where it wasn't wanted.
This your wife?
Yeah, we, uh... Well, not any more.
We're getting a divorce.
It's funny.
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.
Believe me,
nothing is trivial.
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.
You gonna vanish
into thin air again?
I thought I'd use
your front door.
Look, man, um, I'm sorry
as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.
And then my business
gets blown up real good.
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.
He winked at ya?
Musicians.
What else did you see?
So far I haven't heard shit about what
you're going to do about all this crap!
I mean, what do I get? My livelihood,
it got flushed away and went swirling.
- You ain't lost everything.
- Yeah?
And maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!
Fair enough. Catch.
- Jesus.
- Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.
What are you tellin' me, this...
You tellin' me this thing is real?
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.
You know, you're directly out of
your fucking mind! You know that!
Yeah. Eyes see.
It's one of the most important things
I learned from my sister.
Sister? She's supposed
to be your sister?
My father's daughter.
That's right.
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?
Now, let's take it
from the top, friend.
And a lot of detail.
What do you say?
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.
He-He told me to tell T-Bird
that death was on its way.
Whatever the fuck that means.
And... Draven.
He said his name was Eric Draven.
Want to relax that thing now?
And this bird man,
he just happened to let you live, huh?
You sure you ain't making all of this up
just to save your own ass?
I ain't makin' all this up.
I ain't twisted
like you two fucks.
All right.
A boy and his bird.
Awful touching.
Yeah.
Oh, for fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.
- Thanks.
- Funboy said he saw a black bird too.
A big one.
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.
I'll have the janitor, uh,
come on up.
You again.
You lost or hungry?
Hi.
<i>It can't rain all the time...</i>
<i>Can't rain all the time...</i>
<i>Can't rain all the time... Can't rain</i>
<i>all the time... Can't rain all the time...</i>
I don't know how many times I gotta
tell you. We're in this together.
We ain't and one part falls
and it all falls.
- Do you know how long it took us
to put this together?
- Yeah, a long time.
That piece of rat shit made Tin Tin
into a fuckin' voodoo doll.
Tin Tin was a dick.
Tin Tin.
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up!
- No Funboy.
- Probably still bangin' away on Darla.
Smokes and road beers.
Be quick.
I'm on it.
What the fuck are you
supposed to be, man?
I'm your passenger.
Drive.
What's all this happy horseshit?
Hey, T-Bird! T-Bird!
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
Stupid asshair!
You hit my car!
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.
- This is business, right?
- Faster.
You got that cream stuff?
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.
What in the crap...
Oh, look.
You're makin' us popular.
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.
<i>This is vehicle 38.</i>
<i>We got us a big ol'red hot rod.</i>
Hey!
You got somethin' personal, amigo,
we can work it out, right? Huh?
Damn! Dead end!
Look out!
Oh, man, get out of the way!
Holy shit!
Goddam foreign cars!
Shit! Fuckin'...
Oh, I hate this.
This ain't good.
T-Bird, I got you, man!
I'm coming!
Shit!
Remember? Yeah, I remember everything.
But I don't know...
What? What? Huh? What?
What are you talkin' about?
No, no, no, no, no.
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her. We needed to
put some fear into that little lady.
She wasn't going along with
our tenant relocation programme.
Then her idiot boyfriend shows up
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear
into a total cluster fuck.
Who gives a shit?
It's ancient history.
What? What do you want?
What is it? What?
Speak to me. Speak!
Did you send us these complaints?
Come here.
"Abashed the devil stood."
Does it get you sweaty?
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.
You can't be you.
We put you through the window.
There ain't no comin' back.
This is the really real world.
There ain't no comin' back.
We killed you dead.
There ain't no comin' back.
T-Bird...
There ain't no comin' back!
There ain't no comin' back!
T-Bird.
"Abashed the devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is."
He felt how awful goodness is.
He felt...
T-Bird. T-Bird!

Wait. You loved eggs.
Yeah, when I was five.
So what do you want now,
black coffee and cigarettes?
So what did you take
to become Mother of the Year?
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.
- Who?
- Oh, it was nuts.
You're acting weird. Did you win
the lottery or something, Darla?
Oh, forget it. I never was
too good at this mommy shit.
Over easy.
I like 'em over easy, Mom.
Hey, Albrecht.
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.
- We're gonna have to I.D. His teeth.
- His name is T-Bird.
Arson was his specialty. Looks like
he zigged when he should have zagged.
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'-shit.
Come here.
You're holding out on me.
I got a goddam vigilante killer
knockin' off scumbags left and right,
and you're covering up for somebody.
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?
Hey, you're the detective.
Why don't you tell me?
Okay. Gideon's blows all to hell,
and you're having a chitchat
with some weirdo...
who winds up in T-Bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.
Then you steal one of
my case files from homicide...
and you're saying this is just
a fuckin' automobile accident?
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good. You know,
you gotta write that shit down.
All right, smart-ass. The captain's got
a little love note waiting for you.
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your suspension.
Suspension? For what?
Misconduct.
Yeah, give me the lab.
- One for sorrow, two for joy...
- Come here.
And three for a girl
and four for a boy.
- Dancing...
- Here I am.
Eric?
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.
Gabriel.
I thought you were dead.
You're not dead, are you?
I knew it was you.
Even with the make-up.
I remembered your song.
You said, "Can't rain all the time."
That is from your song, right?
Come on, Eric, I know you're here.
I miss you and Shelly.
Gets so lonely all by myself.
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.
Sarah, I do care.
That's him. That's him!
But he looked different.
He was all painted up white
like some kind of dead whore.
I seen him. T-Bird, he sent me in
for some road beers, right?
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.
And he flash-fried T-Bird
to his fuckin' car!
Oh, T-Bird!
Here's to you, buddy.
Maybe we oughta just videotape this,
play it back in slow motion.
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?
- Empty.
- Fire it... Grave? What grave?
- What about my fuckin' grave?
- Three out of four.
- Oh, man!
He's working his way
back to this speed freak right here.
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.
That boy was out of control. T-Bird,
he came in, he says, "Waste 'em both."
And now this ghost
gonna kill my ass next!
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.
- This ghost gonna kill m...
- Hey.
It ain't no ghost.
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.
We might need him.
Ghost gonna kill my ass.
He like his plain or with onions?
Fine. Don't talk to me.
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?
That's what I thought.
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?
You'll just think I'm nuts.
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.
You see him too?
I saw somebody.
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.
Eric didn't come back for me.
He can't be my friend any more
because I'm... I'm alive.
You want a friend to walk you home?
<i>I am the wicked</i>
<i>I am the wave of the future</i>
<i>Being crucified</i>
<i>You things, things</i>
<i>things of the flesh</i>
<i>Do it slow</i>
<i>Down avenues</i>
<i>"Cut me"</i>
<i>Lust my eyes</i>
<i>Licking lips encouraging</i>
<i>Mr Careworn</i>
<i>To gaze upon the screen</i>
<i>Bask on</i>
<i>After the flesh</i>
Boys.
It seems our friend T-Bird
won't be joining us this evening...
on account of a slight case of death.
You wanna sit down?
Well, well, well.
Devil's Night is upon us again.
I thought we'd throw a little party,
start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.
I like the pretty lights.
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm sayin'?
- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong.
Best reason to quit.
Only reason to quit.
A man has an idea.
The idea attracts others...
like-minded.
The idea expands.
The idea becomes an institution.
What was the idea?
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.
And I tell ya, when I used to think
about the idea itself...
it'd put a big old smile on my face.
You see, gentlemen,
greed is for amateurs.
Disorder, chaos, anarchy...
now, that's fun!
- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?
I started the first fires
in this goddam city.
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shitheel was imitating me.
Do you know what they got now?
Devil's Night greeting cards.
Isn't that precious?
Yeah.
The idea has become the institution,
boys. Time to move along.
You don't want us to do
"Light My Fire" time for the whole city?
No.
No, I want you to set a fire so goddam
big, the gods'll notice us again.
- That's what I'm sayin'.
- Right.
I want all of you boys to be able
to look me straight in the eye
one more time and say...
"Are we havin' fun or what?"
- Hey, you! What's your name? Skank!
- Huh? What?
- You don't feel that?
- I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.
"I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook."
Well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud of you.
How the hell'd that thing
get in here?
Gentlemen.
Let me go! Let me go! I gotta go!
So you're him, huh?
The avenger. The killer of killers.
Nice outfit.
Not sure about the face though.
I just want him.
Well, you can't have him.
- Well...
- Let me go.
I see you have made your decision.
- Now let's see you enforce it.
- Aw, this is already
boring the shit out of me.
Kill him!
Ooh, that had to hurt.
Well, that's that.
That guy was crazy.
He's gone.
Oh, no!
Get him!
Right here! H-Here, help me!
Help me! He's tryin' to kill me!
Jesus Christ!
Hey!
You're all going to die.
Get the fuck outta here!
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?
I'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there. Skank's dead.
That's right.
- What in the crap...
- Don't move! Hold it!
That's all she wrote.
Move and we shoot!
<i>You are surrounded by police units.</i>
<i>Do not attempt to escape.</i>
<i>- Stop running immediately.</i>
- Holy shit!
<i>... spread your arms and legs...</i>
<i>Stop immediately.</i>
<i>Lie down, spread your arms and legs...</i>
Come on! Move it!
My advice: Next time duck.
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away doughnuts.
Shit!
I knew you were going to do that.
Look at that out there. The whole
city oughta be in flames by now.
The sky oughta be red.
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.
I like him already.
The crow is his link...
between the land of the living
and the realm of the dead.
So kill the crow
and destroy the man.
I'm coming home, Shelly.
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery
in the middle of the night. Right?
- The safest place in the world to be.
- That's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.
It's really late, Sarah.
You didn't say goodbye.
You're just gonna have to
forgive me for that.
And you're never coming back.
I gave this to Shelly once.
I think she'd like you to have it.
This way you'll always remember her.
I'll never take it off.
I'd better go sneak back in the house.
Bye.
Shh. Shh.
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.
Come on. Come on.
What is that, some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say? Hmm?
Her eyes are so innocent.
Eric! Eric, help! Eric!
Quick impression for you.
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!
Give me the girl,
and I'll let you walk out of here.
Well, well. Why don't you just give me
a minute to think about that, huh?
Nah. Fuck it.
Aw, fuck.
Well, well, well, it does seem to me
that our little life...
has undergone a rather significant
change in the past few minutes.
Now wouldn't you agree?
Well, for a ghost
you bleed just fine.
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it.
Bye-bye, birdie.
Aw, shit.
Well, I just came by
to pay my respects, and here you are
gettin' all shot up again.
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?
Two more.
- I can handle it. Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan. You stay in
front, and when they run out of ammo,
I'll arrest 'em.
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.
Oh, shit.
You're bleedin' all over the place.
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.
I was. I'm not any more.
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you? Come on.
You take that.
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.
This is all the power you ever had.
Now it is mine.
Pity there is not more time...
for us.
Help me!
Eric, I'm scared!
Let me go!
Let her go!
You can have me.
I won't fight you.
- All right.
- No!
Eric!
- Sarah?
- Look out!
Eric!
You know, my daddy used to say,
"Every man's got a devil...
and you can't rest till you find him."
Whatever happened back there
with you and your girlfriend,
I cleared that building.
Hell, nothin' in this town
happens without my say-so.
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans there, friend.
But if it's any consolation to you...
you have put a smile on my face.
You got a lot of spirit, son.
I am gonna miss you.
I have something to give you.
I don't want it any more.
Thirty hours of pain.
All at once!
All for you.
Yeah.
Go help him.
Are you alive?
God, I need a cigarette.
- Everybody else dead?
- You helped me.
What you kept in here saved me.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
I've been meaning to
come to church anyway.
Oh, yuck.
I'm quitting as of now, if I live.
Stay with him until help comes.
He'll be okay, right?
Eric?
He does that a lot.
Shelly.
- At least it stopped raining, huh?
- It can't rain all the time.
No, I don't believe it.
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
- Look, you go on home. I'm okay.
- Okay.
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.
- You missed it.
- Get him out of here.
Thanks.
If the people we love
are stolen from us...
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.
Buildings burn, people die...
but real love is forever.
