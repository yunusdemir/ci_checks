It's Mojo Radio
back on the air.
Slamming Sammy here.
Football time in Texas.
Let's go to the phone. We got
Butch on the line with us.
Butch, what about it? We'll
have a great year, or what?
How you doing?
Good.
Tell me about this season.
We're gonna have a hell
of a season this year.
Winchell's gonna
take us all the way.
Deep slant trips stacked right?
Primary receiver's
inside flanker.
"Z" burst.
My linemen are
in 80 pass block.
How deep is your drop?
Five steps.
Five steps. Trips stacked left?
Inside 8-yard curl.
You gonna get a scholarship?
Yes, Mom.
"Z" receiver.
It's Mojo Radio,
Slamming Sammy,
and I've got Jerry on the line
from the Sonic down there.
Jerry, there's a lot of talk
that Coach Gaines, with that
$60,000 a year salary...
I know where
we're going with this.
He makes a little bit more than
the principal of the school...
Just last week,
I was reading this
book about Babe Ruth
and they asked him if
he deserved his salary
way back in 1910 or
1904, whatever it was
and he said, "Hey, you know..."
They said, "You make more
than the President."
He says, "Well, you know, can
the President hit a baseball?"
I'm telling you,
Coach Gary Gaines,
they could give
him $100,000/year
and if these
boys go undefeated,
it's worth every single dollar.
I tell you what, the principal of
Permian don't get 28,000 people...
I have two to three
seconds of protection
if my linemen are
in 80 pass block.
Wide receiver?
He runs, burst route.
If he sees cover two, he bends
outside 8 to 12 yards.
20 yards, and runs
straight to the sideline.
Are you ready for this, Mike?
Yo. Ivory.
- Ready to work?
- What's up, Boobie?
State. State.
State?
Where your
girlfriend at, Water Bug?
Well... We ain't got
a girlfriend yet?
Come on, let's go. Snap it up.
You wanna know why you ain't
got a girl yet, Water Bug?
Why?
You got the wrong shoes on,
man.
You got on white Adidas.
Everybody know
the shoe is Nikes.
Nothing holds a
nickel next to Nike.
Ask lvory. Ask Preacher Man.
What kind of shoes on
your feet don't matter.
Come on, Preacher. Bullshit.
Don't matter at all.
You know God
made black beautiful.
God made Boobie beautiful,
black and strong.
His mouth keeps getting
bigger and bigger.
And when Boobie
knocks some fools out.
Boobie gonna knock them out
with black Nikes on his feet.
I could knock you out
in a pair of flip-flops.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna knock
them out with Nikes on my feet
and I'm gonna smile when I do.
Let's go. Five minutes.
Get up. Let's go!
How y'all doing up there?
You all doing all right?
45, Boobie, that's
my nephew out there.
The boy can play some
football, I'm telling you.
I think he'll win
the Heisman Trophy someday.
The Heisman, really?
Yes, sir. You can bet on it.
I got it.
Who's you
guys' favorite player?
Boobie Miles.
- He can spin left.
- He can spin right.
Don't make no difference.
He can block, tackle, score
the touchdown, snap the ball
hold the snap and
kick the extra point.
Hell, the boy will fill
up the Gatorade cooler
walk the dog and
paint your back porch.
I'm telling you, that boy
can flat out play football.
And he can pass!
Should we believe the hype?
What hype?
The hype about Boobie Miles.
No, hype is something that's not for real.
I'm all real.
I'm Chris Comer.
I'm a running back.
So that means
you're Boobie's backup?
I'm actually Boobie's backup backup.
I'm third string right now.
You know which way
you're supposed to run?
Yeah, with strong right...
I ain't talking about the play.
I know what the play was, okay?
Odessa is a small town
and when you screw up,
everybody knows about it.
Your dad played at Permian.
What's it like to be
the son of a local legend?
Hold on to the damn ball,
Donny.
Next question.
There it goes!
How are your grades, Boobie?
I get straight A’s.
I'm an athlete.
In what subject?
There's only one subject.
It's football.
Ain't no other subject,
you know?
Hut!
You sure he's part of
your gene pool, Charlie?
Shit!
Red alert, everybody.
What about the expectations
of coaching a team like this
in a community like this?
Well, I guess
there's always a surprise
or two in every community.
Just concentrate on hanging on the ball.
Both hands.
Hey, Donny.
Come here. What's the problem?
Get off the field, Dad.
Why can't you hold
on to the football?
What's so God damn hard
about holding on to it?
I'm sorry.
All you gotta do is hold
the ball, and you can't.
Tell me why you can't do it.
That's all I wanna know.
I'll try better next time.
Come on.
Charlie!
Don't you walk away from me.
Don't you walk away from
me when I'm talking to you.
Tell me why you can't do it.
Enough.
Tell me. Answer a question.
Mr. Billingsley.
It's the first day of practice.
This is practice. Seriously.
Enough. Charlie!
Embarrassing me out here.
Jesus Christ.
It's all right, Don.
It's all right. Don't
worry about it. Here we go.
Slot right. 38...
Billingsley, you ain't gotta worry
about holding on to the ball.
Why's that? 'Cause you
ain't gonna get it.
Your job is to be
blocking for Boobie.
I don't care if your daddy
is over there crying.
You never shut up, do you?
Our team’s been playing with
each other for a long time
and we got the brotherhood
part of it down pretty much.
People here at Permian
are already predicting
a State Championship.
Is there any pressure
to that for you guys?
Any time they start predicting
the State Championships
there's always pressure,
believe me.
You guys don't
have a lot of size.
How can you make up for that?
We're gonna rely on our speed
discipline.
Come on, lvory.
You're in the game now.
Do football players get
special treatment here?
What do you have to do to be a
better football player this year?
Do you enjoy playing football?
You quit reading your press
clippings, all right?
Because you're smaller, and you're
gonna be smaller every week.
Yo, Boobie Miles!
It is hard to be humble.
Ain't gonna be no growth spurt
between now and the first game.
Where does all that
anger come from?
They're gonna underestimate
you every single week.
We teach you this
technique for a reason.
We do not do this to
make our heads rattle.
You're gonna use your mind.
You're gonna play with your heart.
Come on.
That's what you're gonna use
to win the State Championship.
Get up, lvory.
It's a good day, gentlemen.
It's a good day to think
about responsibility.
It's a good day to ask yourself
if on a personal level, you're
willing to accept that.
If you're willing to
accept the responsibility
that you have to
protect this team
and this school and this town.
And make no mistake
about it, gentlemen
we are in the business
of protecting this town.
We're in
the business of winning.
The expectations
couldn't be any higher.
We will win State.
Can you be perfect?
Mojo!
No, I'm all right.
Come on, Mike. Live a little.
He's not going out, either.
Yeah, he is. Mike,
you're going out tonight.
If I have anything to say about
it, you're gonna get laid, too.
Billingsley! Billingsley,
party at Taylor's house, now!
You better be there.
Gonna get wasted.
Party at Taylor's.
Isn't that guy, like, 35?
Mike, here's your mom's food.
How much?
Don’t worry about it.
It's on us.
How's she doing?
You never give me
free food, David.
I just gave you free food.
Yeah, I forgot about that.
Say hi to your mom.
Yes, sir.
Stay out of jail, Billingsley.
You're not going home, Mike.
I ain't going
out drunk fooling.
How about I bring your mom dinner
so you can come out with us?
Because we'll get laid,
get drunk
and we'll win State, but not tonight.
All right?
You been blessed, Mike,
because we got a runner.
He's gonna make
us all look good.
So I'm telling
you to lighten up.
All you gotta do is exist in
those two seconds between snap
and you giving Boobie the ball.
So lighten up, Mike.
How you doing? Hey, Brian.
How's old Gaines treating you?
Got you boys in line?
Got y'all perfect?
We getting there.
How's your mama?
Fine, sir.
You mind if we get a shot
real quick with the kid?
Shot? Yeah, little picture.
Yeah, sure.
All right. Just take a picture.
My baby girl and the next Texas
State Championship quarterback.
Where's the damn camera?
Winchell, remember every minute of this.
I'm telling you right now.
You're 17, but it goes fast.
Don't sleep,
don’t waste a second of it.
'Cause before you
know it, it's done.
Nothing but
babies and memories.
You hear me?
Babies and memories.
Smile, sweetheart. Give us a smile.
Say "Mojo."
Why don't you hold on
to her for a little while?
Baby-sit her for us
for a couple hours.
We're gonna go get a drink.
We'll be back in a little bit.
I'm kidding with you.
Come here, sweetie. Let's
go back over to Mama.
Thank you.
Bring it home.
Bring one of these home.
Get you one of these.
Christian, get you one of these.
Boys? Right here.
Wanna go to that party?
Just for a little bit?
What I saw was speed out there,
but where’s the beef, Coach?
I saw me some small boys.
They're small.
I think we're gonna be okay.
On defense?
Yes, ma'am.
I firmly believe that.
We got some backs.
We're about, what, 180?
Hi, Mike. I'm Melissa.
I know who you are.
You do?
Everybody knows who you are.
Everybody knows
who you are, Mike.
Is that right?
Arab oil embargo...
Oh, God. Don't talk about that.
Midland Lee likes to
bust it up the middle.
You're right about that.
You know what you should do?
You should play
Boobie Miles defense.
Work him both ways.
I don’t want to get him hurt.
We need him to
score touchdowns.
Bullshit. That big nigger
ain't gonna break.
You wanna beat Midland Lee, you
play him middle linebacker.
Break some heads out there.
Are you ready for
Midland Lee, Coach?
This is not about Boobie.
This is about the fact that we're
sitting here while they're up there.
I wanna be with a ball carrier.
Baby, Boobie is...
Don't you "Baby, Boobie" me. I wanna
see something. You gonna play?
Can I get a touchdown?
How about that?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I don't know.
Why doesn't he
have a girlfriend?
Is that a rule or something?
No, not really.
Well, then why don't
you have a girlfriend?
Just don't.
Are you gay?
What? Is he gay?
I'm not gay.
Can you prove it?
Coach, here's to the start of your
second season as our head coach.
We're here. We believe
in you and Sharon.
Thank you.
And to sitting here in December
as the state champions of Texas.
Let's bring them hell.
Go, Mojo!
Go get them.
Bring in some glory, Coach.
Why isn't anyone
allowed at your house?
People come over.
When?
Is your mother really crazy?
No.
Are you crazy?
Do I look crazy?
You look like someone who'll get
out of Odessa, Texas one day
and never look back.
Seriously works for me.
See you.
Get in here, boy.
Come on. Get this off.
Don't be getting so prudish.
Stop. We're on your couch.
Something for everybody.
Let's go to your room.
Let's go to your bedroom.
Dad, can you just go
back to bed, please?
Who's this? This Melissa?
Yes. Maria.
How you doing, Maria?
Damn, girl. You have grown up.
Dad, please. Can you
just go back to bed?
What happened to my lamp?
Hey, y'all. What's going on?
Hey, Flippy. Hi, Maria.
What happened to my lamp?
I dropped it.
Yeah, you dropped it.
That makes perfect sense.
He dropped it.
Can't hold on to the lamp,
can't hold on to the football.
I can hold on to the football, Dad.
Now get the hell out of here!
Little fumble.
Can't hold on to the football.
Since when can
you hold on to it?
I haven't seen it.
You hold on to it today?
Yesterday? You hold on
to the football yesterday?
You seen him hold on to the football?
How about tomorrow?
You gonna hold
on to it tomorrow?
How about now?
Hold on to the football.
God damn it, Dad.
- Dad.
- What are you doing?
- Maybe this will help.
- Dad!
What are you doing?
Hold on to the football!
Dad! God damn it,
Dad! Knock it off!
I don't think we've felt this
kind of expectation in years.
If Winchell shows up
like we know he can
even a short passing game to give
Miles a few feet of cushion...
You boys all right?
Yes, sir.
Gonna win State?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Undefeated?
Yes, sir. Get it done.
"The Southern California
lifestyle"
"is but one of
the bonus features"
"of playing for..."
What's that word?
"Distinguished."
Who's that one from, UCLA?
No, this is USC.
That's UCLA right there.
Hey, Mike.
You gonna come visit my
distinguished ass in California?
See if I can put the
damn smile on your face.
You know I'm fitting
to be rich, right?
I'm thinking about
hiring Eddie Murphy
to lay some of his shit on you
till you crack a damn smile.
No? Well, what about
Richard Pryor?
Bill Cosby?
I know you like Bill Cosby.
Mike Winchell
you got a natural ability
for throwing Boobie Miles the ball.
And every once in a while,
you throw a pretty good pass
so you're going to eat
your Jell-O Pudding Pops.
Yo, Mike Winchell
you gonna move out of
Odessa, Texas one day, baby
and you gonna come visit
Boobie Miles in California
and you gonna smile
or I'm gonna stick four pudding
pops up your white ass.
My God! I got
Mike Winchell smiling.
Look at this.
Did y'all see it?
That's probably the only smile y'all
gonna see from Mike all season.
Yeah.
I'm distinguished now.
- Hey, Boobie.
- What?
You didn't lift.
Come on, man.
This is God-given.
Only thing I gotta
do is just show up.
Now, people call this monument
out here, the Ratliff Stadium
the monument to
football of Odessa.
They say some of that money
should have gone to the school.
What's your feelings on
that, D.U.? You played ball.
Ain't that stadium
part of the school?
So I say that money
did go to the school.
What's everybody whining about?
This is football country, folks.
Come on, get your heads out.
Hi, Don. Hey, Karen.
It's you. Do you like it?
Think so. What is it?
Rice Krispies.
You like it, right?
Yeah, I love it.
Thanks. You're welcome.
Hey, Gary.
Hey, John. How you doing?
Good. You real busy?
I got a minute or two.
What you got up?
I got some characters out here.
Who you got with you?
Wilkins. Hey, Gary.
How you doing?
How's that pretty wife of yours?
She's good.
Ready for Friday night?
Sure hope so.
Seems pretty good.
I feel pretty good about it.
Really.
We just wanted to
come by and visit
maybe talk about defense a
little bit, if you got a second.
You got a second?
We got a dog named Mojo.
We got a cat named Panther.
You got season tickets?
You kidding? We don't miss anything.
We go to all the scrimmages.
Instead of the cover two zone...
Get the D-line in as many gaps
and stack gaps as possible.
Double dent, type of technique.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Boobie.
How you doing?
All right.
- Strong "B" slide force.
- Hell, we can look at...
Yeah. He'll still be a robber...
Get lvory out of the board.
And go. Go.
Go by the speed and make up
for the size differential.
What do you think, Coach?
Now, obviously
we're not Division I
but we’ve got a good program.
You play well enough, we'll find
you a spot at Kansas Wesleyan.
How far is the drive?
What drive?
To your school. How far is it
from Odessa to your school?
I don't know. 10 or 12 hours.
Are you offering?
Ma'am?
Right now. Are you offering?
If you are, we're in. Mom.
He'll sign his
intent right now.
Well, obviously we’re
interested, Miss Winchell.
Otherwise we wouldn't be here,
Mike.
But right now, that's
all we are, is...
interested.
Now, you go get at them,
you throw some touchdowns
you win some football games,
maybe a State Championship
we'll see if we can't find you
a home at Kansas Wesleyan.
Yes, sir.
Do you like playing football,
Mike?
Yes, sir.
Is it fun for you?
Lots of fun, sir.
He loves the game.
That's good. It's important.
It's legitimate
love of the game.
Supposed to be fun, you know?
Greatest game in the world.
I'm not that good at toasting,
but I'll give it a try.
Fact is, I don't know if I've
ever done a toast myself before.
Been involved in a few, but...
Here's to Boobie Miles, who...
Well, everything you get
this year, you deserve it
because you work hard,
and I'm real proud of you.
And L.V., to you.
I can't even tell you
how proud of you I am
the way you've raised this
kid and what you do for him.
Here's to a great season,
and God bless us.
God bless us.
God bless.
We been thinking about
this for four months now.
You seniors have been thinking
about it for 17 years.
Well, it's here now. It's time.
If any of you have
any doubt in your mind
I don’t want you to walk
through that door over there.
You shouldn't have
any doubt in your mind
about what you're
supposed to do tonight
and about how
you're supposed to do it.
So let's take care of it!
Way to go.
Boobie Miles.
Did you see that?
You can't turn it
back to Boobie Miles!
All Boobie, all the time here.
A Mojo first down.
Boobie around one more!
Yeah! That's my boy!
Boobie Miles from 45 yards out
scores a Mojo touchdown.
Billingsley takes it right.
Boobie. Here we go again.
Into the end zone.
Touchdown, Mojo.
Boobie Miles has it all,
all in one great package
the speed, the size,
the athleticism.
Let me tell you, folks, Boobie Miles
is worth the price of admission.
Yeah! Yeah, all right!
Miles breaking
loose one more time.
Yes, sir!
Broke the line.
Chavez!
Chavez is playing
like a man possessed.
God damn, I'm so proud of you!
Calm down, son.
Chavez will eat you...
Billingsley.
Go sit on the bench.
Go get on the bench.
Crazy.
I like enthusiasm,
but my goodness.
He's gonna throw
it. What an arm!
Did you see...
Boobie Miles, from 35 yards
out, scores a Mojo touchdown.
You're doing a great job.
Give me a smile.
Thank you, Coach.
Boobie Miles is about as
solid as you can ask for.
He ain't gonna smile.
Why not?
Why didn't he ever smile?
He's more internal.
Let me kick that extra point.
Not this time. You did enough.
Come on.
Chris Comer, you're going in.
Comer, you're in the game.
Come on.
Hey, son, come here.
Where you going?
You don’t want
me to go in, Coach?
You don’t want a helmet?
Where's your helmet? Go get it.
Yes, sir.
You see my helmet, man?
Find your helmet, son.
What you looking for, Water Bug?
Hey, let me get this real quick.
No way.
Come on.
My goodness gracious.
Boobie.
Water Bug, you can't come
out here with no helmet.
You seen my helmet right here?
I can still go in.
28 sweep.
You don't know where your helmet is!
What are you thinking?
Where did you put your helmet?
Right there.
Well, it ain't there!
Do you not know that you play
the game with a helmet on?
Sit your tail down right now!
He throws back to Miles.
Miles cuts to his right.
Bailey takes him down.
Was that a knee?
Could have been.
Hold on. Hang on.
Winchell was still in there.
Billingsley was still in there.
Unfortunately
the running back
has been taken down hard
and it looks like
a knee could possibly...
Just gonna touch
the kneecap here.
Does it hurt over
here on this side?
Get up, Boobie.
Let me take a look at this.
It's definitely his ACL.
I mean, it's a legitimate tear.
Do you think
he tore any cartilage?
Maybe. I could feel
the knee catching.
What do you think?
This kid, it's all about
how he responds mentally.
I don't know.
All right, everybody.
Listen up.
He's gonna be fine.
It's not serious.
There's no tear.
He'll be back in a week.
That's the good news.
Even better news, y'all played
a great football game tonight.
A real good football game.
I'm real proud of you.
And Mike...
Where's Mike Winchell?
Mike, I'm proud of you, son.
You showed discipline.
You showed leadership.
You played your butt off, son.
I'm proud of you.
All of you.
Proud of all of you.
And, Wilson,
now that's body tackle.
That's what I been
telling you about.
Did y'all see him tonight?
Anyway, I'm proud
of every one of you.
I'm proud of the coaches, all
of y'all each and every player.
I want you to go celebrate.
Feel good about ourselves
tonight, okay? Come on!
We only got a minute and
a half left in the game.
We're leading by a good lead.
He leaves the boy in there like that.
That makes no sense.
You gotta protect
your best asset.
What's the matter with this man?
He could've ruined the whole
season for us right there.
We were
up. We were winning big,
and the boy stays in the game.
Yeah. You don't need any more.
You don't need to
accomplish any more.
I think Coach
Gaines is a stupid idiot.
Well, he shouldn't
have put him in.
I mean, we had a big
lead and everything.
I don't understand
what that was all about.
We can't do anything
without Boobie.
We had the game won.
I'm feeling some damage
on the right side here.
Well, can I play on Friday?
I think you got a slight tear.
Can he play?
Yeah, can I play?
Can he play football?
Can I?
You need to get up
to Midland, get an MRl.
Can a MRl fix your knee?
Is he the one player
you can't do without?
Well, I never looked
at it that way.
A football team is not about
one player or two players.
A football team
is about the team.
This is a unit, and that's
the way we have to play.
It's gonna be a challenge.
You are making
some bad decisions!
You're playing like
the village idiot.
You want people to think
you're the village idiot?
As the Eagles
take down the Panthers, 49-6
and for Coach Gary Gaines
play's gotta be back
to the drawing board.
That's gonna be the word
around town all week.
Coach Gaines,
what are you gonna do?
The loss of Boobie Miles can not
result in the loss of this season.
Hell of a game.
Give me the keys.
Way to take care of business.
Give me the keys, Dad.
We...
We just need a few more days,
Coach, and we be back.
You go into Midland,
get that MRl?
I don't need
nothing in Midland.
Those rich hillbillies
ain't never seen nothing
as pretty as
Boobie Miles' knee.
Them MRl machines wouldn't
know what to do with it.
He gonna be just fine,
Coach Gaines.
We gonna go back to the clinic
but they already said
there ain't no tears.
No tears? Ain't no tear.
Is that what they said?
Yes, sir. We gonna go back
for some double confirmation
but when it come time to play
Midland Lee, we be good to go.
That's good then.
He designed his
offense around one player.
We're dead.
We're not dead.
We just need to start
throwing the football.
We're dead.
Dead. Pull it.
We gotta lighten up.
We're 17.
Do you feel 17?
I don't feel 17.
Pull it.
We will win State.
Chavo, you're like
a human piñata.
You get your ass all beat
on more than anybody I know
and you just sit there
and spit out candy.
That's 'cause he's out of here.
He's got the grades.
No matter what, if we win or lose,
he knows he's getting out.
He's like the one-foot-
out-the-door man.
You're gonna
be drinking martinis...
Give me the gun.
- Eating lamb chops.
- Getting manicures.
You're just jealous.
Removing your freaking shoes?
What's it like
being the quarterback?
I mean, this is a big responsibility
for a 17-year-old kid.
No! That is not acceptable!
It's sort of, I mean...
it's not too bad, I know.
You are playing like a fool.
Do you think you can handle it?
If you got a receiver
getting jammed inside
what will you do
with your brain?
Yeah, hope so.
What will your brain do?
You'll throw outside!
Throw it outside.
You'll throw outside!
Now you think you can do that?
Yes, sir.
Well, show me.
Hey.
I thought maybe
if you came home,
it would help out a little bit.
She's sick.
She's not doing so good.
It's just kind of hard. Football's
starting and this is a lot.
I thought if maybe you could come
home, it'd help out a little
because she's your mother, too.
Okay.
Can you get the job done, Mike?
We're pretty small.
I didn't ask you if
you think we're small.
I asked you if you think
we can get the job done.
I think so.
You're gonna have to do better than
"I think so." Is that clear?
It's clear.
Now I'm gonna
assume that by now
you've learned that
the world's not fair
and sometimes you get the short end.
That's all you get.
And if you don't do something
personally to fix it
then that's all
you're ever gonna get.
Yes, sir.
Mike.
Do you want to
play college ball?
Do you want to
get out of this town?
I think so.
Why aren't you doing
something about it?
My ma's not right.
One of these days, you're gonna
have to get out of this house.
You're gonna have to leave her.
Yes, sir.
You got to accept the fact that people
have to take care of themselves
and that includes you.
You understand that?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
The truth is
against some
pretty overwhelming odds
if you do decide
to accept that...
Look at me, Mike.
If you decide to accept that
you're gonna
seriously fly, son.
Same song, different verse.
Middle of the second quarter,
Cooper has a 14-0 lead.
Things are really
going south in a hurry.
But when you got an offense play
built around one
player, that's great
as long as the player's there.
When he gets hurt, in this
case like Boobie did,
what do you do?
I don't know, but Gaines better
come up with a plan quick
'cause
the unthinkable will happen.
The Panthers are gonna lose two
consecutive district games.
Wilson gets the handoff
and he's got room to run
on the left-hand side.
Across the line.
Clotheslined by Gary Grubb.
And he's down.
Give me a running back!
We got a running back?
Permian has lost
Boobie Miles, now Wilson...
Comer! Yeah, come on!
Leaving him with third-string
running back Chris Comer.
Comer around the right side
has some room to run,
and runs out of bounds.
What is that?
I didn't have a block.
You are so soft!
Are you scared?
I didn't have no block.
Football is a contact sport!
I think he's a sophomore.
Looking for a badminton scholarship
but that's not gonna cut it.
Blue 40!
The snap. Looking to
throw. Here comes the rush.
Winchell avoids the
rush, throws the ball.
Comer turns from
blocker to receiver
has the ball,
crosses the 20-yard line
crosses the 30.
Comer to the 40! Comer to the 50!
Where did this speed come from?
Go!
Who was that? It was Comer.
Our Comer?
It was Comer.
Comer has a Mojo touchdown!
Chris Comer with
his first varsity TD.
Not letting go of that ball.
Give me the ball.
85 yards, the second-longest
power play in Permian history.
Interception, Brian Chavez!
Abilene Cooper back
to punt. It's blocked!
Touchdown, Permian!
That's a Mojo touchdown.
Jesus!
Billingsley up the middle, picks
up a great block from Comer.
Forearm shiver,
in for the Mojo touchdown.
There's
your old school football.
Where did this guy come from?
Chris Comer has poured
on some fantastic runs
and one fantastic pass reception
leading Mojo
from a 14-nothing...
Hello?
I'm feeling great. How are you?
I feel much better than
I did before the hit.
This team has a swagger.
They're walking tall
and playing tough.
I love these kids.
I love the way
Winchell is playing.
They came together
after Boobie went out...
He's got him.
Touchdown in the corner!
You know, we just
have to dig deep...
Comer's amazing.
He's stepping in just nicely.
My concern is that he doesn't have
the experience in the long run.
If they can just stay strong,
not get overconfident
and take out Midland Lee,
I think we're going, man.
I think we're gonna go all the
way, but I'm a little worried.
Oh, no, sir.
It's just a small sprain.
It was just a precaution.
We're on a roll.
Don't get started on the
celebration dance just yet.
We got Midland coming up.
Midland Lee is the real deal.
You don't need to
be swaggering now.
You got to be
playing and practicing.
Permian zips
past North Shore Galena, 17-3.
Come on, we're five and one.
The team is winning now.
They're winning,
but who we playing?
I mean, come on, mediocre teams.
Two losses could shut the
door on the Permian Panthers.
Let's not start tooting our horns just
yet, you know what I mean?
You lose two division games
in this football climate
and you're done, Sammy.
Midland.
Boobie.
This the best damn
hospital in Texas.
The very best.
My son, Andrew,
played for Midland,
and ended up back East at Penn.
He's playing with Joe Paterno?
University of Pennsylvania.
Premed.
Just let it relax.
You have any pain?
Not at all.
Does this hurt? No.
None of that hurts? Nope.
Okay. Go ahead and sit up, and
just let your legs hang over.
Go ahead and get dressed
and let me look at the scan.
I'm sorry. You're James' dad?
No, I'm his uncle.
Come over, and let me
look at the scan with you.
This is the scan we just
did today of his knee.
This is looking right through
the middle of the knee.
What we’re looking at right
through here is the ACL
and what this shows is that
he's had a fairly significant,
fairly serious injury.
Let me show you. Right through
here is where the injury is
and it looks like you've had
a pretty serious injury
to that part of your knee
significant enough
that I have concerns
about what you
can do from here on.
So when can I suit up?
Let me just say, with how your
knee felt when I examined it
and what I see on the scan
with the things that you do well
the reason that you’re great
is you can run and
cut and hammer people
and you don't hesitate because
you've got a solid knee.
When you don't
have this ligament
you can't do that, so
it's out of the question.
No. That's not what
Dr. Spencer said.
He said three weeks. Three weeks
is up, and I'm ready to play.
I understand.
But again, when I...
Based on what I see when I
feel and examine your knee,
what I see here you really
can't play with this kind of...
What are you talking about, "I can't play"?
I'm gonna play.
I'm ready to play. My team needs me.
I'm ready to play.
Listen to me.
I am listening to you.
I want what’s best for you.
You and I are
on the same page...
We ain't on the same page.
How you gonna want what's best for me?
Hold on.
How you gonna want what's best for me?
You from Midland, right?
This is bull, man.
You just jealous
'cause you from Midland.
What I recommend...
Who paying you?
Come on, Boobie. That's okay.
You trying to take
my football career!
Boobie, let's get out of here.
Whatever you're saying
to me, listen to me.
Who's paying you?
Here back on Mojo Radio,
it's Slamming Sammy Stands.
I knew tonight's
game was gonna be
a big game,
but it just got bigger.
Earlier today,
Cooper beat Woodland.
If Permian wins tonight,
they're in the play-offs.
If they lose, though, they fall back
into a three-way tie for first place
and that means the
tie-breaker is a coin toss.
So what did the doctor say?
If you go out there before
your knee's ready...
Coach, my knee's fine.
You okay with this, L.V.?
Yeah, I'm good with it. 100%.
Go get dressed.
The most storied rivalry
in the state of Texas
is Permian hosting the Midland
Lee Rebels at Ratliff Stadium.
Tonight one of these teams
could take a step
toward the play-offs.
Permian has one district loss,
both Cooper and
Midland have two.
There's no doubt about that.
Awin tonight puts
Permian in the play-offs
no coin flip needed
plus it will send the Lee
Rebels home for the season.
Well, what do you know, folks.
Look at this.
Coming out of the locker room
number 45 has emerged
from the locker room.
Boobie doesn't look like
he's limping at all.
He looks good to me. He looks
like he's ready to go.
Now the question
is, decoy or player?
He ain't gonna play.
I don't think so either.
From what I know
about Coach Gary Gaines
nobody holds his
cards closer than Gary.
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Winchell pitches to Comer.
Flipped on his head!
Winchell, pressured by Olivera
swings a pass out
to Billingsley.
Picked off by Dominguez.
Dominguez will take it
in from 25 yards away.
And Lee breaks on top.
Hang on to the ball, son!
Don’t worry about it.
Shake it off.
Don’t worry about it, Coach.
Let me spin.
Y'all want to win,
put Boobie in.
Set. Hut!
Winchell will swing
it out to Billingsley.
Come on, Donny.
And the ball is
stripped by Dominguez.
Kevin Lane, and a blatant
facemask by Billingsley.
Dang!
What's up?
My goodness. Son, is there something wrong with you?
Are you mentally okay?
What are you putting your helmet on for?
Take your helmet off, son.
You're on the bench for a while.
You don't need that helmet.
Third down with less than two
minutes to play in the half.
Strandler over the left side, uncontested.
32 yards down to TD.
Permian came
in with a four-game win streak
but they haven't
been tested all year.
Coach Gaines has to find a way
to get his offense on track
or start feeling his season
slipping through his fingers.
Do you think
you're playing football?
You are showing me nothing!
Do you understand me?
Do you think you got it made?
Because if that's what you think
you're gonna find out what it
feels like to sit on your asses
and watch Midland Lee
take your season!
No offense tonight for Mojo, and
still no sign of Boobie Miles.
Y'all want to win? Put Boobie in.
I'm about to spin.
Come on, Coach. Let
me get this for you.
Under five minutes to play,
and Lee still leads 14-7.
Weak defense, weak
offense and no Boobie.
If you're Coach Gaines,
what do you do?
Right now, Mike Winchell
can't get this offense going
and the Midland coach has
seen Boobie on the sidelines.
If you don't put him in,
he knows you're bluffing.
I'd put him in.
All right, move out!
Come on!
Boobie, you're in. Let's go.
What you want?
Well, we apparently are all
gonna get what we wished for
because here comes Boobie Miles
and this is certainly
what the fans came to see.
That's number 45 back
in the Permian backfield.
Back slam, 37 stretch, on one.
Break!
Now it's gonna be
the senior, Number 45
lining up behind
quarterback Mike Winchell
that offensive line is raring
to go with room to run.
Three, 12. Hut!
Miles going left.
Hesitates just a bit.
Get off me!
Let's go with 60.
Let's go.
They're gonna cheat
up to the line again
see if they're gonna
run Boobie once more.
He will go to the right.
There is a hole.
He gets a block.
The Dominguez brothers take him down.
He spins and he's down.
Don't touch it.
Try to relax.
Let me take a look at it.
I'm gonna get up on my own.
I can get up on my own.
Folks,
the utter joy of watching
Miles trot back on to the field
has been replaced
by the sheer misery
of watching him
being carried off of it.
We, unfortunately, may have
seen the last of Boobie Miles
in the black and
white of Permian.
Let me see. He's done.
We're gonna go jet fire, Coach.
Well, you better go something!
One minute, 35 seconds
left to play in this one.
Panthers move immediately
to the hurry-up offense.
Boobie no longer a factor.
Comer, following the tackle,
will dig up near midfield.
The clock now inside of 1:20.
It'll be second down, Permian.
Lee clings to that seven-point
lead, and time becomes a factor.
60, Cheetah.
60, Cheetah! Hut!
Again, Winchell to
Payne, beating Preston.
Only 40 seconds left.
Mike Winchell trying to keep
Permian's play-off hopes alive
completes the pass!
He's got it!
Winchell was drilled,
but he seems to be okay.
Back it off!
Winchell has time, he's looking.
Again, Winchell to Payne.
The clock continues to run.
25 seconds left. Go!
Go to the left.
Let's go! Throw it up!
Hold it! Hut!
Mike Winchell trying to keep the
play-off hopes alive. Complete!
This is for the ball game.
The clock is still moving.
Come on, front line!
Mike Winchell will
throw from the shotgun
steps back and
he drops the ball!
Picks it up,
steps into the pocket,
looking for Allen Wyles.
He's open.
Here's the pass,
and it's too tall!
Midland Lee wins the ball game.
It's all right. No, man.
I'm sorry.
Thanks for nothing,
Coach. Go home, cowards.
I don't understand what's gonna
happen at this point. How do we...
Another loss, and that's thrown
us into a three-way tie.
They're going to
have a coin toss.
You're serious?
We're gonna get the
three coaches together.
They're gonna all toss a coin.
That's 5-A's football tie-breaker right now.
What can I say?
What the hell kind of way is
that to make a decision?
When you assemble the kind
of talent that we have here
and then you just
throw it away like that.
It started with him playing
Boobie when we had a big lead.
This is a once in
a lifetime thing
to be able to see these people.
I mean, we could have been
in the history books.
And now? Ain't no way.
I mean, that's it.
What about
Winchell's play tonight?
Well, what do you think?
And Billingsley
couldn't hold on...
They all suck!
I think it's 'cause
of the coaching.
You know what else it is, too?
They been doing too much
learning in the schools.
My daddy used to take a
bullwhip, and he'd cut it up
and he'd tie 13 knots in it.
Then he'd beat me in my gut
till I got a sick
feeling in my stomach.
Well.
That's how I feel
when I watch you play football.
Sick at my stomach.
I need some fresh air.
What the hell are you doing?
Get this sickness
out of my stomach.
Yeah.
God damn it, Dad.
You were sent down here
to learn how to play football
and you haven't.
You have not.
And I got to take that
as a personal failure.
Nobody in Mojo football
wants to win in a coin toss.
But that's the way it is.
That's the way
the tiebreaker is.
Well, they ought to change that.
They ought to change coaches.
Make a lot of
changes next year.
I was supposed to
make a man of you.
Shit.
Do you know what that is?
That's a State Championship.
I won a State Championship.
Just calm down, Dad.
Can you touch that?
Hell with it.
What the hell are you doing?
You drunk bastard.
You ever feel cursed, Coach?
Like, no matter what,
inside your heart
you feel that
you're gonna lose.
Like something's
hanging over you
following you like a witch,
or a demon that just...
Why you got to be so messed up?
You can’t win.
I feel like that all the time.
Even when things
are going good.
When we're winning, it's there.
And when we're losing,
it's there.
What is wrong with you?
It took me a long
time to realize
that there ain't much difference
between winning and losing
except for how the
outside world treats you.
But inside you, it's about
all the same. It really is.
Fact of the matter is,
I believe
that our only curses are the
ones that are self-imposed.
You know what I'm saying?
We, all of us,
dig our own holes.
God, Dad.
What is wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is truly unbelievable.
A three-way tie for first place.
So, in less than an hour,
this truck stop
which we're not allowed
to reveal the identity of
will serve as
host for a coin toss
that will send two of these
teams to the state play-offs
and one of them
home empty-handed.
Okay, Skip. We're on
in three, two, one.
Folks, we're here with the
three winning coaches.
We've all agreed on the rules.
Two out of three here,
odd man out.
If you got one tails,
they're out.
If you got one heads,
they're out.
It's a tough way after a
great season for the coaches
but this is
the way it's gonna be.
So when I give the word,
we're gonna toss our coins
and then the district's gonna
have its two representatives.
Now let's see the coins, guys.
Coach Doug McCutcheon from Abilene
Cooper's got... What is it?
1922 silver dollar.
'22 silver dollar. All right.
And Coach Gary Gaines from
Permian, you got a '69 nickel.
And from Midland Lee.
Coach Earl Miller's
got a basic U.S. quarter.
Okay. Coaches ready?
One.
Ain't no curses.
Two.
Three. Toss them.
Coins are down.
This one looks like it's heads.
Okay, that's heads
for Abilene Cooper.
That's mine.
It's heads.
Okay, Midland Lee is also heads.
Hey, we got a third
one over here, Skip.
Coach, that's you.
Come on, Gaines.
Don't touch that.
Just leave it alone.
That's heads.
Yup, that's heads, too.
Permian is also heads. Man!
Well, that figures.
The way your teams played each other
it'd take more than one toss.
Hang on a second.
You know, this
coin's pretty worn.
Does this look
like heads to you?
I can't tell the difference.
It might be tails.
There might be some controversy
here regarding Cooper's coin.
It's tails.
So the good news is
that life continues
for both Midland Lee
and Permian high schools.
At least for another
couple of weeks.
That's the good news.
The not-so-good news is
that it looks
like all roads are
eventually leading
to Dallas Carter.
And what a monster of
a team Dallas Carter is.
This Dallas Carter team appears
to be completely unstoppable.
The rumor is
they've got nine players
that have already signed
Division I letters of intent.
Damn, them boys big.
They are a very good
football team, people.
I'll get that car fixed today.
Yeah.
I don’t want this to sound
like an apology or anything
but I didn't mean
half the things I said...
I know.
You just...
You ain't getting it.
You don't understand.
This is the only thing
you're ever gonna have.
Forever.
It carries you forever.
It's an ugly fact of life.
Donny, hell.
It's the only fact of life.
You got one year
one stinking year to make
yourself some memories, son.
That's all.
It's gone after that.
And I'll be damned
if you're not gonna miss it.
No guts.
What's up, Water Bug?
What's up, Boobie?
Water Bug. Play-offs
belong to you, baby.
I'll make you proud.
What y'all looking at?
Play your ass off.
Win State. Be perfect.
All that shit.
This is a gift for you.
It's gonna be
worth a lot of money.
I bet it will.
You be perfect, Preacher Man.
What's up?
Now what we gonna do? I can't do
nothing else but play football.
Don’t worry about that.
I can't be doing nothing else.
You'll be all right, son.
I can't do nothing
else but play football.
Why? We practiced
and we practiced.
You told me we were
gonna go to the pros.
What the hell am I gonna
do without my knee?
You'll find somebody else.
Don’t worry about it, son.
No. I wanted to buy you a house.
They won’t let me play, though.
It's play-off time in Texas.
And who cares if Permian
snuck in on a coin toss?
There's
been a lot of expectations
for this Permian football team.
And you got to love
this play-off atmosphere.
They call this the thinning of the
herd the survival of the fittest.
Win, you go on. Lose,
you play basketball.
Quarterback Mike Winchell.
Drops back, pulls right,
throws long.
Caught! Touchdown!
The Panthers defeated
Dallas Jesuit to advance
to the next round 16.
Down south, the killing
machine that is Dallas Carter
rolls over Lufkin to 16-0.
They're going to the 20,
to the 10, to the 5!
It's Comer, folks, into the end
zone for a Mojo touchdown!
Chris Comer, with another
sensational performance.
Permian cruises past San
Angelo and into the quarter.
Permian looked great tonight
but Dallas Carter is playing
on a whole different level.
Interception, Brian Chavez.
- Great read of the play.
- Touchdown!
45 yards out.
Permian defeats Nimitz, 48-7.
Moving into the semi-finals
of the Texas 5-A play-offs.
Carter, monster play, advancing
them to the state finals.
Mike Winchell drops
back, throws a 50-yard bomb!
It's gonna be caught by Parker!
Hits the pylon in the corner
of the end zone. Touchdown.
That's it. Permian's gonna
battle Dallas Carter
for the Texas Class
5-A State Championship.
What would it take for you
to come up to Texas Stadium?
How about if
y'all come out here?
Where? Over at Ratliff Stadium?
Yeah.
I still think there'd be a problem
with our fans sitting with your fans.
I don't see any problems.
We can bring in extra police to
handle the crowd-control issues.
Mr. McClary, perhaps you're not aware
but we have an all-black community.
Frankly, between our communities,
there are some issues.
Wait a minute. What issues
are we talking about?
I'm not gonna get into it at this table.
It's just different.
How about if we went
with a neutral site?
Say, College Station, or San
Anton, somewhere like that.
Or you know what we could do
is the Astrodome.
Astrodome.
I got no problem with that.
Good.
Let's discuss officials.
I think the simplest thing to
do is get a zebra crew out of
some neutral place like San
Antonio, or something.
Now are these zebras
gonna be white or black?
Well, as far as I know,
zebras are white and black.
What are we talking about here?
How many black stripes
these zebras got?
A zebra's got about the same amount
of black as he does white ones.
How many black stripes
you think a zebra's got?
It makes sense to hire a crew as is.
That's how we always do it.
Don't make sense to me.
It makes sense to me.
Not me.
Not a whole lot does
make sense to you.
Yeah, there's a lot
that makes sense to me.
So you think having an
all-black officiating crew
is gonna help you win the game?
Watch your mouth.
Hey, Coach. How you doing?
Ben, how you doing?
All right, Coach. You?
Pretty good. Hi, Sharon.
How you doing?
We're just out getting
flowers for the ladies.
Secretaries week.
Is that right? I'll be dogged.
I don't have a secretary, so I
don't have to worry about it.
You win State, Coach,
we'll get you two secretaries.
Everything all right?
Yeah, everybody's gonna be just fine.
Everything's all right
as long as we get out there and
get what we need to get done
and, you know, win State.
Boy, I sure hope so.
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, I want it bad as y'all do.
Yes, sir.
You know, Dallas Carter,
that's a tough team.
Real tough team. Yeah?
We're a pretty tough team, too.
Yeah, that's true.
So, beat them.
Or what?
"Or what"?
Or...
You know, that would be a
real bad deal for you, Gary.
All right? Let’s just get
out there and get it done.
Get that State Championship.
Well, I sure
appreciate your support.
We believe in you.
I'm glad you do.
We're behind you, Coach.
See you, Sharon.
Well, that was subtle. Yeah.
Are we gonna move again?
It's possible. No, baby.
What do you think about Alaska?
What about Alaska?
Well...
I bet that they are
not nearly as serious
about their football in Alaska.
I think that's
a real nice idea.
We should go to Alaska, stay
there for a couple of years. 20.
It's just something
to think about, baby.
I think it'd be really nice.
Build us a nice little igloo.
Baby, these boys are big.
Yeah, they are. Sure are.
Did you sleep last night?
Yes, sir, I did.
We got a six hour ride,
so we can get you some more.
All right, Coach.
Coach.
You got room for one more?
Absolutely. Hop on.
Mojo has come to Houston.
This is the Astrodome, the
eighth wonder of the world
and today, it's going to be Odessa
Permian versus Dallas Carter.
This is a moment these kids have
been looking for their whole life.
They started
playing as 8-year-olds
in the Pop Warner fields
of Odessa, or in Dallas.
They've dreamed of
the State Championship
laying in bed late at night
dreaming of their chance
to bring home the title
for their town, for their team,
for their school.
Folks, lock the doors,
turn up the radios,
strap yourself in.
We've got East Texas
versus West Texas.
We've got Texas high school
football at its finest.
No doubt. This crowd is jacked.
This is going to
be an all-outwar.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome, Dallas Carter fans...
Permian,
the home team, in white.
Carter, the visiting
team, in red.
To the 1988...
- Let's shake hands.
- Have a good ball game.
Texas 5-A...
I'm gonna ring your bell
all day long, Mexican.
Football championship.
You, too, Goldilocks.
Let's go!
Let's play football!
All right, Dallas
kicking off to Permian.
We're underway in
the State Championship.
Jones' kickoff
carries eight yards.
Comer should down it there.
Wait. He's going
to bring it out.
Howser makes the tackle
on the 3-yard line
and Chavez is very slow to get up
as he was just blasted to the turf.
Be patient in there.
Keep your cool.
Yes, sir.
Be a leader, okay? Yes, sir.
The run's 277, dolphin.
Let's go!
- Saturday is finally here.
- The Texas Bowl is underway.
Winchell, first and 10 for
Permian, inside their 5-yard line.
Winchell,
under center will back up.
Here comes Stuber!
Dad gum it!
And just like that, Stuber's safety
has given Carter a 2-0 lead.
Which game are we in?
And Whitaker will find Grande
with a weak pass
as Chavez is leveled.
And Grande will take
this one to the house
from more than 50
yards away in play.
There's not a Panther
within 10 yards of him.
That's a Carter
Cowboy touchdown.
Carter will go for two.
They will not kick.
No surprise. This
team has not kicked
an extra point or
a field goal all year.
Whitaker now
will make a bootleg.
Going left will get
the two-point conversion.
Cowboys, 10. Permian, 0.
What's it like
out there, lvory?
They're big.
They're fast.
Fun ride, huh, big boy?
They're dirty.
Ball's gone!
He's holding me, Ref!
Plus, they fast.
Yeah, you said that already.
Hut!
You can not fumble against
a team this good.
Two runs to deep turn!
Keep your head in the game!
Help me out! 45-2 split!
It's going to be Whitaker to
Cane from 26 yards away.
He levels Chavez.
And another Carter
Cowboy touchdown.
All day long, baby.
That's it.
You have to wake up, understand?
Yes, sir.
You gonna let the offense do
everything, or help us out?
I'll help us.
You'll help us out? Okay.
Keep them out of the end zone.
If they score more than
we do, we lose the game.
All right? So wake up!
It's been all Carter
here in the first quarter.
Carter over 161 yards already,
and Panthers minus 21.
Winchell is driven
hard to the turf.
Comer, stopped at
the line again.
Great grandma's drawers!
I can't believe that.
Winchell's nailed again.
Right now, I don't know if we
need to worry about the scores.
Just whether or not we’ll be able
to take all these boys home.
Permian's
offensive line is being...
What in the world are you doing?
Did you see that?
Back up, Coach.
He almost killed him!
Clay, this game is quickly
spiraling out of control.
At some point, you gotta worry
about the safety of the kids.
The Panthers came into this
ball game really fired up.
Right now, they've got the
wind just knocked out of them.
Get your head in the game.
Are you in the game?
Yes, sir. You have to
wake up out there!
Yes, sir!
Five minutes left to play in a
half that's been all Carter.
They lead 18-0. Third and
1 on the Permian 40.
Come on, Preacher!
Whitaker with a pro set in shotgun.
Looking once again to throw.
Come on, D! Let's go!
McCleery's coming
on the zone blitz.
Robert Whitaker
will look to throw.
Looking right.
Ball is in the air.
And it's picked off
by lvory Christian.
And I'm pretty
sure the Preacher Man
is headed for
the promised land.
He may take this
one all the way.
Finally a spark of life in
the form of lvory Christian!
Whitaker has taken him
down inside the Mojo 5!
We've got plenty of
time to get this game.
Y'all need to wake up out there and
play football. You understand?
You need to find each other.
'Cause you need each other
right now, so find each other.
Let's go.
Let's get on the board.
Arrow 637.
Count it on one. Ready.
Jump on the ball!
Snap to Winchell,
drops back, rolls right.
He's gonna run it inside the 5!
Winchell hurls his way
towards the end zone.
Anthony has him
but Mike Winchell will stretch
himself into the end zone
for the Mojo touchdown!
Winchell drives
to the goal line.
Yes!
Holds the ball
out over the plane.
He didn't break the plane.
Coach, we've got him.
Ref, did you see that?
What? He got in.
There's no way he got in.
How you going to...
Winchell's without a helmet!
Kicked in his face!
There's not a flag
anywhere on the field!
How can you miss that, Ref?
Time has run out
in the first half.
Coach Gary Gaines and his Mojo
Cats trail Carter by 26-7.
What happened on that play?
That's right.
You understand that?
40 yards? Hell no!
You guys are not
doing any pass blocking.
You’re just stepping aside
and letting them walk in...
Pop! That's what I want!
All of you around that ball!
To go for two and get it every time?
That's ridiculous.
They haven't
kicked a field goal.
Relax.
We not trying to
coach y'all now.
Coach done gave you all
these adjustments, okay?
If you do everything
the coach told you to do...
Two-point conversions, I want those gone.
Here's what we’ll do.
We'll use our speed.
We'll run Texas power.
What's wrong with y'all?
Y'all are playing
like little girls!
You act like you never
played football before!
These guys are nothing!
You hear me?
They bleed like we do.
Yes, sir!
They sweat like we do.
Do you hear me?
They went through two-a-days.
We've had two-a-days
in 110 degree heat!
Yes, sir!
Hit everything that moves!
If the ref gets in
your way, you hit him!
Okay, then. Let's play.
They're cheating us, too!
They're against us, too.
This is our team. This is us!
Let's go right now!
Let's get it off
now and let's go!
Permian is going to
have to step up here
and establish some
offensive confidence.
Let's go.
It's real simple.
You got two more
quarters and that's it.
Now most of you have been
playing this game for 10 years.
You've two more quarters
and after that most
of you will never play
this game again
as long as you live.
You all have known me for a while
and for a long time you've been
hearing me talk
about being perfect.
I want you to
understand something.
To me, being perfect
is not about that
scoreboard out there.
It's not about winning.
It's about you
and your relationship
to yourself and your
family and your friends.
Being perfect
is about being able to look
your friends in the eye
and know that you
didn't let them down.
Because you told them
the truth.
And that truth is, that you
did everything that you could.
There wasn't one more thing
that you could've done.
Can you live in that moment
as best you can, with clear eyes
and love in your heart?
With joy in your heart.
If you can do that, gentlemen
then you're perfect.
I want you to take a moment
and I want you to look
each other in the eyes.
I want you to put each other
in your hearts forever.
Because forever's about to
happen in just a few minutes.
I want you to close your eyes
and I want you to think
about Boobie Miles
who is your brother.
And he would die to be out there
on that field with you tonight.
And I want you to put
that in your hearts.
Boys, my heart is full.
My heart's full.
Ivory.
"Our Father..."
"Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name."
"Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done."
"On earth as it is in heaven."
"Give us this day
our daily bread,"
"and forgive us our trespasses."
"As we forgive those
who trespass against us."
"Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil."
"For thine is the kingdom, the
power and the glory forever."
Amen!
That's it, baby!
Keep left!
Hut!
Way to go, lvory!
Lead and roll.
Spread right eagle.
Are you hungry?
Thank you.
They're killing
us with their size.
They're playing some
hard-hitting football.
Get off the ball!
Drive hard!
Shit!
You will not be here again.
Do you realize that?
You don't understand.
Boy, we gotta play.
Golly bum!
"Z" up 543.
Get to the first down marker.
I'll hit you as
soon as you get there.
On one, ready. Break!
React to the snap!
Show me something!
Did you see that?
That's the way to play ball.
You know that was a bad call!
Now if he backs up on the
next series, it'll be over.
He can't drop back fast enough.
Yeah, it's good.
After
the blowout of the first half
we've seen a showcase of defense
here in the third quarter.
The score closing with
Carter on top, 26-14.
10:25 remains in
the fourth quarter.
It's third and 10 for Carter
as Whitaker spins
and hits Drake for 6.
Tackled by Thomas. It's
going to be fourth down.
You know Carter's
going for it on fourth.
Unbelievable. James is not
even going to consider a punt.
So now Whitaker on fourth
down as Carter will go for it.
He's gonna look for Graf.
Graf's the main receiver
and this one
bounces off the turf.
Incomplete.
No way. Got that right here!
Did you see it?
I'm gonna talk to him.
I wanna talk to
whoever did see it!
This is big, man. Anybody
get a better look? Gary?
Did you turn?
I turned and looked,
but I was lost.
That ain't no catch.
I couldn't see it.
Are you sure he caught it?
It was a catch, Ref.
Lee, Mack, set them up.
We got first down.
What are you talking about?
That was a bad call!
This man has it. This
man had the catch.
There's no way. The
ball came off the turf.
That is bullshit!
Here's the pass.
Whitaker has found Graf.
Graf makes a one-handed
phenomenal catch
for another CarterTD.
Chavez in frustration
levels him in the end zone.
Personal foul on the defense.
That's gonna cost
Permian 15 on the kickoff.
Following the Carter two-point
conversion they now lead 34-14.
These Panthers are
getting beat physically.
They're getting beat mentally.
They're really down.
We've seen this before but Permian's
always been on the other end.
We're looking
for the next play.
Comer got across the 5.
Comer, to the 30, to the 35.
Comer could go
all the way, folks.
Comer, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5!
That's a Mojo touchdown!
Chris Comer has brought
Permian back one more time.
We're in this ball game now.
5:27 to play.
Carter still leads 34-21.
Come on, Chavo!
They will pitch it to Grande.
Ripped away by Chavez!
Let's go!
Come on!
Now strong right,
81 Trojan horse.
All right, here we go.
Let's shock these punks.
Strong right, 81 Trojan horse.
Me and you, baby. We got it.
Throw it deep. On one, ready.
Mike Winchell to Don
Billingsley will go right.
There's room to run,
but stop, wait.
Instead he's looking
for a receiver.
Winchell's open!
Winchell's open
in the end zone.
Winchell makes
a tremendous catch!
Winchell, with a touchdown reception
scores the Mojo touchdown!
One more.
But is it too little, too
late for Coach Gary Gaines?
Mojo defense is really
gonna have to step it up
if they have a prayer of winning
the State Championship.
Grande, across midfield.
Tripped up at the 40.
First down! Let's go, baby!
The clock now has to be a
concern for Coach Gary Gaines
and the Permian staff.
We need to stop.
First and 10 now for Carter
from the Permian 30.
Less than two minutes to play.
One more Carter first down,
folks, and that will be it.
Grande hit!
Yeah, baby!
They do know how to tackle.
All right!
It's my edge.
Second down and long.
Dropped for a loss.
Just keep rolling it, baby.
Come on!
The clock continues to roll.
This will set up third down.
Permian desperately needs
a stop to get the ball back.
Grande right up
the gut over Chavez!
Maybe just short of what he
needs for a first down.
First down here,
and the game's over.
It didn't make it.
It's short.
That's short, by inches!
James immediately
signals he's going for it.
- James is going to gamble.
- He can get these four inches
and win the State Championship,
right here, right now.
Here's what we’re gonna do.
We're gonna do a Texas stunt.
Ivory, you and Steen,
I want you to twist.
Steen, you go first. Yo, Coach.
Ivory, you come off his
butt into the "A" gap.
Lucas, crash the "A" gap, too.
Let's shut these
cocky sons-of-guns down.
Now let's go.
Let's shut them down.
Let's go. Let's shut
them down right now.
- Right here.
- Take them.
West Texas football, baby.
Whitaker comes to the line.
Okay, let's go.
Come on, D.
Looks across.
Calls the cadence.
Hut!
Hands to his running back.
Grande!
Damn it, boy!
I want you to show them who we are.
Yes, sir.
Okay? Show them who we are.
Execute!
As Winchell gathers his
teammates up into a huddle
he can see on the big clock
down in the end zone
one minute and
40 seconds to play.
One time-out left, and he has 75
yards of Astrodome turf to go.
Go!
Green, 12. Hut!
Winchell swings
it out to Comer.
Comer has it, picks up a block.
That away, Comer! On three!
Off to Billingsley.
Billingsley great
job of picking up
the first down. Stops the
clock by going out of bounds.
Okay, let's go. Let's get wild.
Come on, Michael!
You or Raymond!
Let's go!
Winchell takes time as he drops back.
He's looking to the right.
Payne is wide open
down the right sideline!
The pass is in the air!
The Tennessee-bound Trissell
comes across the field
to knock the ball loose.
Payne had it.
I'll tell you. Mike Winchell,
folks showing how tough he is...
Come on, baby, get up!
Hanging there under
unsurmounting pressure.
Winchell appears to be okay, folks.
He's one tough dude.
He's back on his feet. Let's go, baby!
We need you, Mike!
"L" right, 90.
Mike, you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right, man.
Under a minute to play,
52 seconds.
Winchell will scan, fake it to Comer.
It's a bootleg pass.
He's latched onto it. It's
Wyles, down to the Carter 25!
Look, I want you to feel it.
Show me some heart.
Permian's showing what
a tough out they are.
Come on, Donny. Go!
That's a first down!
Whose game, baby?
Whose game is it?
Come on, there we go.
Clay, he's hurt.
He grabs his shoulder.
Trapper helps
him off the field.
Feels like he dislocated
his shoulder.
See you, fella!
Shake it off.
Get back out there.
Strong left 90 "Z" five, ready?
Break!
Permian with 35 seconds
to play go to Comer!
And Comer over the red zone.
Did you see that?
I'll back up when
I'm through talking to you.
Comer is on Queer Street, walking
towards the Carter sideline.
Winchell on third down
again, will drop the pass.
Hard to the turf,
and Permian will
have to burn
their final time-out.
The third and final time-out.
They have to pass. They've
no choice but to pass.
All their backs are out.
We gotta go to the air.
You gotta throw the football.
They ain't got no running back.
Trapper, I need a running back.
All right. Just relax.
We'll pop this back in.
On the count of three.
One, two...
We're good to go.
You're going to
set a Bronco stunt
then drop into the full
pass, prevent coverage.
You got that? Got it.
So, Clay, if you're Gary
Gaines, what do you do?
Coach Gaines is done
out of running backs.
He's gotta go to the air.
A vertical smash
and a double out.
I agree.
Coach, we gotta get number
one across the goal line.
Squeeze it. I agree.
Hang on a second.
Billingsley, can you do it?
Yes, sir.
You sure?
Can you hang onto the ball?
Yes, sir.
Okay, then.
Now here's what
we're going to do.
We're going to do
"I" right wiggle,
34 switchblade.
Now, let's go, Mike.
Billingsley, they're gonna try
to strip the ball from you.
Cover it. Cover the points.
Roll with it. Don't resist it.
You got it, baby.
No more fumbles.
That's right.
Let's go, baby.
It's in your hands.
Don't think about that shoulder.
Just keep driving your feet.
"L" right wiggle,
34 switchblade.
For the State Championship.
I love all of you, baby.
I love all of you.
Let's go on one, ready?
Break!
55,000 people in the
Houston Astrodome, folks
and every seat is empty because
everyone is on their feet.
His offensive line digs in.
The Carter defense
digs in to face it.
Down! Switch.
312!
Run it right down his throat.
Hut!
He hands it off
to Don Billingsley!
Billingsley is
looking like Larry Csonka!
Come on!
Billingsley pushes, runs over
another Dallas Carter Cowboy.
Down to the 1-yard line.
What guts to call
a run in that situation!
Fooled everybody on the field.
Wait a minute. I'm seeing
a hold call by the official.
Dad gum it!
Ten yard penalty.
Still fourth down.
That's bullshit!
Strong right, 20 to Frasier!
Winchell must hurry. The clock will
start as soon as the ball is reset.
Come on, Frasier!
Let's go! Hurry up!
32, 330! Set! Hut!
It's Mike Winchell
down to the 5!
Is he in?
You got him short.
That's the ball game!
I'm gonna miss the heat.
I'm going to miss the lights.
Yeah. Me, too.
Stay low, boys.
Keep those feet moving.
Hey, Chavo. Be perfect.
You be perfect.
See you, Mike.
See you, Don.
See you, Chavo.
