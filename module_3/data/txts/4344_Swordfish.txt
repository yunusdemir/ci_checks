You know the problem with Hollywood?
They make shit. Unbelievable,
unremarkable shit.
I'm not some grungy wannabee filmmaker...
...searching for existentialism
through a haze of bong-smoke or something.
No, it's easy to pick apart bad acting,
short-sighted directing, or the purely moronic stringing
together of words many of the studios term as prose.
No, I'm talking the lack of realism.
Realism.
Not a pervasive element today
in modern American cinematic vision.
Take Dog Day Afternoon, for example.
Arguably Pacino's best work.
Short of Scarface and
Godfather Part I, of course.
A masterpiece of directing,
easily Lumet's best.
The cinematography, the acting,
the screenplay, all topnotch.
But...
...they didn't push the envelope.
What if, in Dog Day, Sonny wanted to
get away with it?
Really wanted get away with that.
Now this is the tricky part. What if
he started killing hostages right away?
No mercy, no quarter.
"Meet our demands or the pretty blond in the
bell bottoms gets it in the back of the head."
Bam, splat.
What, still no bus? Come on.
How many innocent victims would it take
for the city...
...to reverse its policy on hostage situations?
And this is 1976. There's no CNN.
There's no CNBC. There's no Internet.
Fast-forward to today.
Present time, same situation.
How quickly would the media
make a frenzy? In hours.
It would be the biggest story from
Boston to Budapest.
Ten hostages die.
Twenty, thirty.
Relentless. Bam, bim. One after another.
All on hi-def, computer-enanced.
You can almost taste the brain matter.
All for what? A bus, a plane?
A couple million dollars that's federally insured?
I don't think so, but...just a thought.
I mean, it's not...
...within the realm of
conventional cinema, but...
...what if?
There's a problem with that movie.
Really?
It wouldn't work.
How come?
Audiences love happy endings.
Pacino escapes with the money.
Boyfriend gets a sex change.
Live happily ever after.
No?
No.
Ahh! Homophobia.
Bad guy can't win. It's a morality tale.
One way or the other, he's gotta go down.
Well, life is stranger than fiction sometimes.
You know, guys, I gotta go.
Gotta jet.
Thanks for the coffee.
Stan. Time to go to work.
You coming?
Move. I won't say it again.
I have a clear shot.
Shooters, stand by.
Okay. Now what?
Don't worry, folks, fine. it's almost over.
- Is she done?
- She's done.
- Move her out.
- Hey, let's go.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
You'll be back before you know it.
Turn the fuck around.
Rescue team, let's go.
Who's on the roof?
All shooters, you are holding for command.
All prepare their shot. All prepare their shot.
Joy, What are you doing?
I'm handling this!
Look, don't fuck with this guy, man!
You'll get these people killed!
We got two teams on the roof.
We got a team over there.
Double this team up.
That's your best angle.
Don't talk. Just listen.
Each of the 22 hostages...
...has been wrapped with 20 pounds of C-4 explosives.
they've also been taped with 15 pounds
of stainless steel ball bearings.
Which makes them the world 's
largest claymore mines.
they got the green light.
Hey! Hey! Look, I got this guy on the phone! Joy?
Get the hell of the phone!
I'm done playing with this asshole!
Around their necks are radio-frequency
electronic dog collars.
Dog walks out of the yard, gets the
shit shocked out of him. Same here.
This bank is their yard, so don't fuck with me.
Johnson, you and your partner move up
between those vehicles.
- Stand down!
- Get back!
Stand down!
Get back!
Officer, stand down right now!
He's gonna shoot! He's gonna shoot!
Shit.
Get her!
Get her!
No! Release the hostage!
No! Release the hostage!
She's gone. Take cover!
No, no, no! Let her go!
Let her go!
Release the hostage!
Help me!
Let her go. Let her go! Let her go!
Jesus.
Shit! You guys, come on!
How long will you be here, Mr. Torvalds?
One week.
Business or pleasure?
Hopefully both.
What type of work do you do?
I'm a consultant.
Excuse me.
Could you be careful with that?
Please. That's expensive equipment.
How long will this take?
A few minutes.
Sit down, relax. I'll be right back.
A few minutes, huh?
Hey, where's he going?
It's going up. Stairs.
Sir, could you please...?
Easy, easy.
This better be important.
you pulled me out of session.
Wouldn't have asked you otherwise, senator.
We just received communication that
Axl Torvalds was intercepted
entering the continental U.S.
When was this?
Within the last two hours.
According to my source inside FBI,
he was nabbed coming through customs at LAX.
They know he's working for us?
It 's unlikely, sir.
It was a routine check.
Torvalds just freaked out. they just got lucky.
This ain't good.
What do the feds know?
Nothing as of yet.
He's refusing to speak English.
The Finnish consulate has contacted
the State Department.
So we haven't been compromised?
I'm not sure. I'm working on that right now, sir.
You better get sure real quick, son.
Because someone's cock's liable
to end up on the block on this one.
...and I promise you it won't be mine.
I understand, senator.
There you go.
Well  well  well
Who are you supposed to be?
I'm Ginger.
Ginger, huh?
Where's Gilligan?
For someone the NSA once listed as the
most dangerous hacker in America...
...you sure don't look like much.
Surprised?
I know everything there is
to know about you, Stan.
What are you selling again?
My employer wants to meet you.
Shit.
You're not too good at golf.
You're fucking up my chi.
Let me have that.
This is not a nice place
you got here, Stan.
Been here 5 minutes, and I already
feel sorry for myself.
You're wasting your time.
I even touch a computer,
I go straight back to Leavenwonth.
Do not pass Go, do not collect 200 dollars.
If I knew you were coming,
I might have cleaned up.
I'm not here to suck
your dick, Stanley.
He'll pay you just to meet you.
I gotta go to work.
Right.
Great work greasing pump jacks.
So...
...spoke to Holly lately?
Shit!
Melissa. Is Holly home?
Stanley.
Why are you calling here, huh?
I just want to talk with Holly.
It's Saturday. She's at soccer.
You know, it's illegal for you to talk to her.
Don't do this, Mel
Hey...it's not good for Holly.
How would you know
what is or isn't good for my daughter?
You spent the last two years in prison.
Mel
Stop calling me that, Stanley.
Look, I just...I just want to see my baby.
Well, she doesn't want to see you, Stanley.
And I swear to fucking God,
if you try to contact her...
...I'll have Larry's attorney throw
you into a hole so dark and deep...
...Leavenwonth will seem like
two weeks in Vegas...
...during which I will personally pay two ball-busting
skin-heads to make a playground out of your ass.
Wow, Mel, you can take the girl out of the trailer park,
but you can't take the trailer park out of the girl
I will not let myself
be manipulated by you, Stanley.
Larry's her father now.
Larry's the porn king of
Southern Calif...
Larry is a film financier.
The films he's involved in are a function of
profitability and none of your business.
Get help, Stanley.
Get into a program,
get a therapist, get a dog.
But whatever you do,
stay away from my child.
Your child? She's our child.
She will never be your child.
Forget Holly.
What are you still doing here?
Look, I'm beginning to
lose my sense of humor.
Okey. Then I'll cut to the chase.
If you want to have a chance in hell
of getting your daughter back, you better listen up.
Unless, of course, you want to stay here
in this loser existence...
...while your daughter grows up to be a
fluffer in her new daddy's videos.
Do me the courtesy of not confuse
your own childhood with my daughter's.
And look at your situation, Stanley.
For the past...what?...20 months, you've
been in and out of court 6 times?
Each time your case was thrown out.
Situation doesn't look good, sweetheart.
How much money would it cost to hire
the best family lawyer in the country?
A lot. Come here.
Come here.
Judas.
That should get you started.
Hundred grand.
What do you got to lose, Stan?
He just wants to meet you.
One time.
You don't like the situation...
...walk away.
And that's it?
That's it. And you keep the money.
What did he say?
All right, look, look, look, look.
Your client is wanted on 24 counts of
electronic crimes...
...in 7 different countries.
He has a Finnish passport.
Finland does not allegations are
not recognized as crimes.
Your laws don't apply.
Do you see a Finnish flag hanging
on the wall, IKEA boy?
What did he say?
He said IKEA is Swedish.
He understands English, huh?
Joe, Let me talk to him for a minutes.
He's all yours.
You're fucked up now, Hamlet.
See, the thing is, they have you put
the furniture together yourself.
My client has repeatedly reserved
his right not to answer any questions.
I just Curious.
Why would the NO.1 hacker in the world...
...risk life imprisonment by coming
into the continental U.S.?
Okay, what...what did he just say?
He said he never misses an episode of Survivor.
Did he really say that?
You're funny.
How much do you weigh?
How much do I weigh?
We'll call you if we need you.
Eat a dick.
Wipe that smile off your face.
Tell about a year ago,
I was head of the largest cyber-criminal...
...task force in the world.
But I burned out.
I snapped.
I shot a suspect in the hand.
Do you know how difficult it is to work
a Keyboard with one fucking hand?
You don't understand.
Whatever you want to
do to me, he'll do worse.
I'm already dead.
The only way I stand a chance is back in Europe.
I have friends there.
If you tell me what I want to know,
I make sure you'll be on the first thing smoking.
First class.
Courtesy of the U.S. Government.
Who is he?
I don't know his name.
You work for the guy. You don't know his name?
Tell me something.
I'll tell you what I know.
He exists in a world beyond your world.
What we only fantasize, he does.
He lives a life
where nothing is beyond him.
But you know what? It's all a feint.
For all his charm and charisma,
his wealth, his expensive toys...
...he is a driven, unflinching,
calculating machine.
He takes what he wants,
when he wants...
...and disappears.
So how do I find him?
You don't find him. He finds you.
Here's how it works.
His people pick me up.
Take me to him.
And he tells me what he wants me to do.
I do the job right there.
I get paid, and I leave.
That's a really nice story, but you
haven't told me shit, have you?
Excuse me, sir. You have a call.
Take a message.
It's assistant director Joy.
He said it's important.
I can only tell you
what I've done for him so far.
Well, that's a start.
Thank you. You've just
let my client go free.
You denied his right to counsel- -
Excuse me.
Yeah, and you eat the dick!
Yes, I got a call from A.D. Joy.
This is Roberts.
Hold for just one moment, sir.
Joy.
Yeah, Roberts. You needed me.
You didn't call me?
No, I didn't call you, Roberts. What do you want?
You should 've let me buy you a suit, Stanley.
I'm happy with what I'm wearing. Thank you.
Ignorance is bliss.
Miss me?
Stanley, Gabriel
Big Stan. Nice suit.
Thanks.
they say the clothes make the man.
You buy it?
Hope not. Drink?
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting.
How about we get to the point?
No. Actually,
you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand.
But that's not the point.
Helga. Meet Stanley.
- Hello, Stanley.
- Helga.
Look, I don't have
a lot of patience, Gabriel
Maybe you can help me with something.
Take a look at this.
What do you think?
You know I can't touch that.
Do you like tequila, Stanley?
This is bullshit.
Look ,you want something from me,
and I want something from you.
DOD d-base, 128-bit encryption.
What do you think? Impossible?
 Nothing's impossible.
Good. So it can be done?
Maybe slide in a Trojan horse hiding a worm?
Something like that. Is this an interview?
Sort of. Marco.
Give him some incentive.
Hey, what are you doing?
Relax, Stanley.
I have been told that
the best crackers in the world...
...can do this in 60 minutes.
Unfortunately, I need someone
who can to do it in 60 seconds.
You're kidding.
Afraid not. Go.
Get up, get up, get up!
Fifty-five.
Get on with it.
What the hell is this?
Time's a-wasting, big guy.
Oh, Jesus.
Forty-five seconds.
Oh, she's good, isn't she?
What's going on here?
Jesus Christ.
More time, more time!
Come on, Stan!
Twenty. Nineteen.
Fifteen.
Come on. Come on.
Ten. Nine.
Three.
Two.
One.
Too bad. You gotta die.
No no no, wait! Wait!
I was just...just fucking with you, Stan.
That's our guy.
Get away from me.
I really want to help you, Stan.
You want to halp me? Like you helped me in there?
- That was a test, Stan.
- A test.
And you passed.
I don't know why I let you talk me into this.
I can't believe how desperate I am.
I thought you're saving your daughter, Stanley.
Look, I'd do anything to get Holly back,
but if I end up in a box or back in jail,
then I really can't help her, can I? So...
...what I should do, is take my money
and go back to court!
Oh yeah? back to count? With your little $100,000?
Melissa will throw $500,000
back at you. Think! Stanley.
What I'm thinking about is that you're willing
put a gun to my head just to see if I can hack...
I can't pee in front of an audience.
Let me break it down to you, Stanley,
one last time.
You live in a trailer.
You're a felon.
You work a dead-end job.
And you desperately want to get your daughter back.
Gabriel is your only shot.
Take it.
Look, I'm concerned about our new friend.
Oh, now, don't be jealous.
I just don't see him dragging his sorry arse
over the finish line.
Stan! Thought we lost you.
Tell me what the deal is.
Well, the deal is that we're having
a little gathering at the house. And then...
If you come and I'll explain it to you there.
Gentlemen,
if it's not good news,
I don't want to hear.
Actually, we have a small ray of hope in
the vast darkness that is your life, sir.
When we grabbed Torvalds at the
airport, these two guys were there.
Check this out.
Recognize those two same guys,
a few hours later. And then...
...guess who shows up.
- Stan...
- Stanley Jobson.
Wired magazine's 1996 Man of the Year.
Pretty much a burnout now, but he was
the hacker zeitgeist of his day
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.
Why are you in L.A., Stan?
His ex-wife live in Malibu,
with her ten-year-old daughter
The new husband owns Backdoor Films,
a shady porn production house in Chatsworth.
You know that? The production value's good,
considering, you know, that they shoot on video.
Did you know he used his wife starred in a couple of the videos?
I know. I know. I know. She's like an actress.
That's great. Are you done?
Who's the girl?
Oh. Ahh...well, actually, sir, we don't know yet.
She's a serious piece of talent.
Man, she's way out of his league.
Find out who she is.
I want you to sit on the ex-wife's house.
You got it.
Stanley, you want to get wet?
I don't have a suit.
You don't need one.
Come on, Stan.
Later.
Some view. Let's get a drink.
Pool lights on.
So how did you do it?
- Do what?
- Break the code.
I used a logic bomb,
dropped it through the trap door.
No, you didn't.
You didn't have time.
What'll you have?
Scotch.
Come on. You can do better than that.
I used a password sniffer.
How did you do it?
I don't know exactly. I just...
see the code in my head.
I can't explain it.
Let me show you something.
Pretty impressive, huh?
So, what we need from you, Stanley, is a worm.
A hydra, actually.
A multi-headed worm to sniff out digital
footprints across an encrypted network.
What kind of cipher?
A Vernam encryption.
The Key code is destroyed upon implementation.
Not to mention being a true 128-bit encryption.
Well, actually, we're talking a 512-bit.
That's definitely not possible.
What if I give you 10 million dollars?
Now, pretty much cover all your problems. Yes?
Unless, of course, it's not possible.
But you think about it.
It won't bite you. I promise.
This is not just a multi-screen system.
It has a DS-3 connection...
...access 7 different networks
simultaneously.
It has a central encryption you
have to crack...
...to utilize the system. Keep to try it.
I don't know. It's gonna be
pretty hard without a gun to my head.
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.
I thought you were Gabriel's.
I'm not what you think I am.
Ginger.
You surprised that a girl with
an IQ over 70 can give you a hard-on?
So is it impossible?
Nothing's impossible.
Good. So we have a deal
Morning.
You mean afternoon?
Can I borrow your car for...something I need to do?
Sure.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Hey, Stan, if you're going
to see Holly...
...I suggest you re-evaluate
the way you look.
Just a thought.
Just a thought.
Come on, Mom, pick up.
Holly? Mom late again?
She'll be here in a minute.
Hi. Can I have the phone number for Yellow Cab?
Need a lift?
Daddy!
Oh, what are you doing here?
I missed you so much.
Oh, I missed you too, baby.
Here. I brought you something.
Oh, my gosh. It 's so cute.
Oh, Dad. If Mom finds out,
she's gonna have you thrown back in jail
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
You want a lift home?
Of course I do.
Come here.
All right.
You are heavy.
Nice car.
Hey, thanks.
Is that Mommy's car? Is she home?
That's my stepdad's car.
So listen to me.
I found a way for us to be together.
I don't want anything else to happen to you, Dad.
Everything's going to be fine.
Everything's going to be okay. Just trust me.
I love you, Daddy.
Oh. I love you. Come here. I love you so much. Oh, God.
You go home. Okay? Bye.
- I miss you.
- I miss you too. Go.
Oh, sweetheart.
Hey.
Come here.
It's okay. Go.
Go. Go.
Who the hell are you?
A friend of a friend.
Shit.
Oh, fuck. Fuck!
Hold it! Hold it! Stanley!
Go!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck!
Don't move!
Don't move.
Come here.
Look at this.
What were you running for, man?
You're arresting me?
What? For violating your parole
by leaving Texas without permission?
Or for evading a federal officer...
...and almost getting me killed in the process?!
No, I'm not arresting you.
Then why are we talking?
What are you doing in L.A.?
Vacationing.
Vacationing, right.
I didn't know the judge lifted the sanction
preventing you from seeing your daughter.
Fuck you.
- Fuck you? Oh?
- Fuck you.
You just want to cut through the
pleasantries and get lie down to it, huh?
Okay, fine.
I can help you with your daughter, Stanley.
You help me, I'll help you.
You'll have to forgive me.
The fact that...
...you know, you put me in jail for
18 months doesn't inspire a lot of trust.
You had a virus in an FBI program
and set it back two years.
they were reading every ISP subscribers'e-mail.
It was illegal.
I did what the judges wouldn't do!
You broke the law! Okey?
We both did what we had to do.
And your program is back in full swing.
This was a nice trip down memory lane,
but if you aren't arresting me...
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.
I ran into your friend Torvalds the other day.
He was vacationing too.
What are the odds of the two best
hackers in the world being in L.A. At the same time?
I'm just a sucker for Disneyland.
We done?
Good.
Tell Torvalds I said hello.
You can tell him yourself
if you're not careful He's dead.
Give me a card.
You think of anything you want to tell me, call me.
Sorry about your nose.
Stan. You're in way over your head.
I know.
You want me to keep my eyes on him?
Yeah, set it up.
I've had a pretty shitty day so far,
but looks like it just got worse.
Either shoot me, or tell me...
...why you're wearing that wire.
Can't do that.
Who are you, Ginger?
I can't tell you.
Who are you?
He'll kill me if he finds out.
That's not my problem, is it?
You're asking for a lot of faith, Ginger
without giving me any.
You brought me into this mess.
I deserve to know who's playing me.
Who are you?
I'm DEA, Stanley.
Holy shit.
We're after Gabriel
So just give him the worm take the money
and get out of here. That's all I can do.
This looks friendly.
You know me, I'm a friendly girl
Come on, Stanley. Let's get a cup of coffee.
Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?
No.
Then you'll appreciate the irony here.
Triple espresso.
- Two.
- Okay.
In the early '80s, the DEA set up a
network of dummy corporations...
...as a government front to launder drug money
and gather evidence.
But problem is these companies
started to make money, a lot of money.
In 1986, when Operation Swordfish was terminated,
there was much 400 million
dollars in the D.E.A.'s accounts.
- Money that just sort of disappeared.
- Thank you.
It didn't disappear. It sat there, earning interest.
That's 15 years ago. You know
Did you have any idea how much money that is today?
Nine and a half billion.
This is a sweet deal
We go in over the phone lines,
pop the firewal...
...drop in the hydra,
sit back and wait for the money.
Arn't you getting ahead of yourself?
Before we can access the secure cluster,
you need a bank on
the backbone of the network.
You now how long that'll take to find one?
Not a problem. Look behind you.
Cheers.
These fellows might wear Armani...
...but they definitely have
the swagger of ex-military.
- Joe
- Yeah. Maybe bodyguards, but they look more like mercs to me.
Sir, there's definitely something's going on here.
They got two DS-3 trucks going into there.
That's serious bandwidth.
Thermal scopes indicate a huge
heat-load in the main living area.
Could be mainframes.
The house was listed by Celebrity Estates.
It was leased two weeks ago
by a blind corporation.
No other info on them yet.
Wait a minute, Joe.
Blue shirt, pinstripe.
Oh, yeah, that's him.
That's our man right there.
Just in time to watch Stanley find our worm.
In college, I created the source code
for the worm I used it for years.
In the basement is the only PDP-10
still active and on the Internet.
Not many people know it.
It's an ITS machine, kept online for historical sake.
So I hid my worm there, where no one would ever think to look.
Voila?
Good man.
Good man.
Senator, we have a problem.
Senator.
Seems you have gotten yourself in a predicament.
Is that right? I don't follow.
Download your file.
Senator...
You know where I got these pictures?
From the deputy director of the FBI
He thought I might be interested.
With all due respect, Sir,
do you think there is any aspect of this
operation I am not fully aware of?
We are aborting the operation.
Take a vacation.
A vacation?
Have I ever failed you, sir?
That's not really the point, is it?
It's my point
You're losing sight of our objective, sir.
The risks are too great.
We'll seek alternative means of finance.
This operation is moving ahead.
Everything is under control
Son...
...let's just say you've got
a 200-pound Rottweiler.
Now, he loves you.
It's his job to protect you.
But if he ever bites you,
even once, you gotta put him down.
Can never tell who he might bite next.
You understand?
Yes, I do understand, senator.
I think we got a team on the
West Coast. Fort MacArthur.
Maybe they should
pay our friend a visit.
Come on.
Network IP range.
Confirmed.
Please confirm. Confirm. Please confirm. Confirm. Confirm.
We are cruising!
Oh, yeah.
Next. And next.
Too easy.
No, don't. No, no, no. Yes!
Three percent, please.
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.
No, no, no. Fuck you!
Shit, there's no fucking way.
I'm rusty. Rusty.
Okay. Time to disguise you...
...as an internal destruction.
Quick, quick. Thank you.
Return.
Three, two, one, go. Come on.
Close.
Oh, baby.
Now I've just got to
modify the code.
The bank's IDS logs every packer that go to any port...
...other than the 22 or 80 TCP.
Holy shit.
White, white.
Nope.
Come on, come on.
Here we go.
Twenty-six. Ninety-six. Nine...
Oh, shit!
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
We gotta talk.
- Let's take a drive.
- Why can't we talk here?
We shouldn't.
Ever heard of Harry Houdini?
He wasn't like today's magicians,
only interested in television ratings.
He was an artist.
He could make an
elephant disappear in a theater full of people.
Do you know how he did that?
Misdirection.
What are you talking about?
Misdirection.
What the eyes see and the ears hear,
the mind believes.
What's going on?
We've got a tail,Hold on.
Shit.
Jesus. Jesus!
Take the wheel
What?
Take the wheel
Holy shit!
Who are those guys?
Jesus!
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus!
Drive, Stan.
Move!
I can't drive this thing.
Learn!
Move it.
Come on!
Hard left! Hard left!
Keep going!
Go!
Get in the car.
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me
what I'm involved in.
Look, Stanley, I like you.
You're on my good side.
But don't confuse
kindness with weakness.
You have 12 hours to get the hydra.
So get in the car.
Stanley, are you okay?
What do you think? I just saw that maniac
murder people in the street.
I'm fucking great.
You can't leave. It's all going to work out.
You gotta trust me.
Trust you? Yeah.
Yesterday I found out you're DEA,
I got the feds crawling up my ass
And I don't know what the fuck is going on, that's the point.
Well if we don't find out who he works for,
we'll just hold thing all over again.
That's not my problem.
I don't care who he works for.
What about Holly?
Do you give a shit about her?
Finish the job.
We'll get your daughter back.
I promise.
Ah, the great American outdoors.
Yet I never understood
the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim.
A little too much like masturbation for me,
without the payoff.
This is a catch-and-release stream,
isn't it?
Yeah, I believe it is.
You gotta see the irony in that,
senator.
The chairman of the joint subcommittee on crime...
...fishing in a catch-and-release stream.
How could you do it to me, Jim?
After all we suffered.
I've changed my identity so many times,
I don't even know who I am anymore.
How could you turn on me
when we were so close to our goal?
The FBI was watching you.
You tried to kill me.
You've misplaced your loyalty, senator.
You've sold out America.
Patriotism does not have
a four-year shelf life.
But politicians do.
What are you going to do with that??
Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the White House lawn for treason.
Now, hold the phone. Thomas Jeff...
Stan. How are you?
- Fine.
- Finished?
Is this Stanley Jobson,
social security number 669547311?
I'm calling from Credit Suisse in Grand Cayman...
...to notify you there has just been a transfer of ten million U.S.
dollars into a new account of your name
As promised.
Thanks.
So I'm done, then.
Soon. Walk with me.
I'm about to do something against
my better judgement.
I'm going to tell you who I am.
Don't bother. I know who you are.
Do you?
I think you think I'm a bank robber.
The truth is,
but I'm just like you.
Like me?
No. Because you're a murderer.
That I am, and worse. Much worse.
But I do have ethics.
Rules I adhere to.
I don't understand why the fuck
you're telling me this.
Well, if you listen, then you'll know.
You asked who those men were.
I wanna tell you.
J. Edgar Hoover started a secret
organization in the '50s,
called Black Cel
to protect the freedoms of
this country at all costs.
I don't care about any of this.
All I care about is my daughter.
I'm talking about your daughter.
Talking abot you, and your daughter...
...and 200 million other Americans who take
their freedoms for granted.
I see.
You don't understand what it takes to
protect our freedoms. That's my job.
That's my job, Stanley.
To protect your way of life.
So you and your band of lunatics are really...
...stealing all this money
just to protect little old me.
That's right, Stanley.
Because wars cost money.
War?
Who are we at war with?
Anyone who impinges
on America's freedom.
Terrorist states, Stanley.
Someone must bring their war to them.
They bomb a church, we bomb 10.
They hijack a plane,
we take out an airport.
They execute American tourists,
we tactically nuke an entire city.
We make terrorism so horrific...
...that it becomes unthinkable
to attack Americans.
You're not going into the phone lines.
You're going into the fucking bank.
And you're coming with us.
It'll all be over in 24 hours.
You're a rich man, Stanley.
Pretty soon you'll be on a yacht with your
daughter, living the good life,
eating bon bons. The American dream.
And just think:
You'll have done your small part
in ensuring America's way of life.
You're a hero, Stan.
Don't worry. Let him go.
He'll be back.
Okay, load them up. Let's move out.
Let's go!
Back!
Move it, move it! Let's move!
Let's go. Move!
Hands behind your head. Let's go!
Key, please.
What Key?
I don't know anything about any Key.
Key.
Let's move!
Back of the bank. Now!
Let's go, let's go!
Down. Everyone down!
Just wait here.
Melissa?
Holly!
Oh, God.
Holly!
Baby!
Baby. Baby.
Shit!
Release the hostage!
No no no! Release the hostage!
- Help me!
- No no no!
Let her go! Let her go!
You all right?
I'm good.
That was your decision!
No no, you did that!
How many more people die is up to you!
I want that plane on the runway
in 25 minutes!
He said he wants a plane on the runway
in 25 minutes.
My suggestion, sir?
You give it to him!
He wants a plane?
I'll give him a goddamn plane.
Stanley, finish the job.
Not until I see my daughter!
You want to see your daughter?
Get him his daughter!
Dad!
Oh, Jesus. Oh, baby, are you okay?
It's okay, it's okay.
You son of a bitch.
Did you really think I wanted it
to come to this, did you?
I told you that I'll sacrifice any lives
I have to, to protect this country.
Including my own.
Let her go.
And I'll get your money.
You finish the job, and you both go.
Come on, Stanley.
- I need the disc.
- Disc.
How do you want it allocated?
Spread it evenly over the accounts.
Come on. Done. Give me my daughter.
Verify this.
Good.
Get her.
You okay?
Okay, come on.
Stanley, hold up.
Good job.
See you around.
I doubt it.
What's happening? What's happening?
The money's gone.
- Stop her!
- Go! Run!
Go!
She's coming out.
Come here, come here!
What happened, Stan?
The explosion scrambled
the internal clock.
No, it didn't. You fucked me.
You kill me, you'll never get a single dollar.
The money jumps every 60 seconds
from one account to another.
It'll do so for the next 10 years.
of course, it was supposed to happen
for another six hours, but hey.
Fix it.
Unfortunately, I can't.
The accounts are encrypted
with a 1024-bit cipher.
Even I can't get through the firewal
So here's the deal
You let the hostages just go and I'll
tell you where and when you can extract the money.
We all walk away. Nobody gets hurt.
Deal
I'm thinking.
No deal. Get Ginger.
Move out.
What are you doing?
String her up.
No. Don't do this.
No! Wait, Wait!
Wait, Wait!
Hey, stay still.
It'll feel real good.
No, don't do this!
You know how long will she live?
Fuck! You're insane!
I say 60 seconds.
- Fifty-five.
- Okay, okay.
Hope you built in a back door.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Thirty.
Sir, plane'll be on the runway
in a half -hour.
Good.
Twenty.
She's dying, Stanley.
Shut the fuck up!
Ten. Nine. Eight.
Accounts, accounts.
That's it.
Three. Two.
There it is. Get her down!
- Check.
- Verified.
Bring her down.
She was DEA, Stan.
Move them out!
People, let's move. Quickly. Come on!
Let's go! Come on! Move it. Move it.
Come on. Move. Move.
No one wants a repeat what happen of this morning.
Keep your distance.
Clear the air space for five miles.
they're on the move.
Move, move.
What?
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking:
If that launcher was a suppository...
...would that bad man stick it
up my ass?
Well, you eyeball me once more, boy...
...I'll stick it so far up your ass...
...you'll be begging me for this bullet.
Ladies and gentlemen, this bus is your new holding area.
If you don't test your collars,
this will be over before you can
say "cat in the hat".
Let's get this fcuking bitch.
How can you justify all this?
You're not looking at the big picture, Stan.
Here's a scenario:
You have the power to cure all of the
world's diseases.
But the price for this is that
you must kill a single, innocent child.
Could you kill that child, Stanley?
No.
You disappoint me.
It's the greatest good.
How about 10 innocents?
Now you get it. How about
a hundred? How about a thousand?
Not to save the world,
but just to preserve our way of life.
No man has the right to make that decision.
You're no different than any other terrorist.
You're wrong, Stanley.
Thousands die every day for no reason at all.
Where's your bleeding heart for them?
You give your twenty dollars to Greenpeace
every year and think you are changing the world?
What countries will harbor terrorists, when they
realize the consequences of what I will do?
Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads
in Minsk for forty million each?
Hell, I buy half a dozen,
I even get a discount.
Advise Joy we have 20 minutes ETA at the airport.
Control, please let A.D. Joy know
we're 20 minutes from the airport.
Ready?
Fill bird's fueled, ready to go.
What about your pilot?
He's in the works now.
All right. Let's do it.
Okay, guys. I need a team over here.
The rest of you, let's go outside.
Fuck!
Jesus. What the fuck is he thinking?
I thought we going to the airport.
Misdirection, Stan.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking the thing?
You see Sugarland Express?
Didn't like the way it ended.
Now pull over before you get...
they can't be serious.
Hold on!
Attention control, this has
now become an aerial pursuit.
I've also got people
across the tarmac.
Sir, I've just been informed
that the bus is no
longer en route to LAX.
What happened?
It broke through the vehicles
and turned onto First Street, heading on the city.
All right. Let's go the First Street.
Sir, the bus is no longer
on First Street.
Then where is it?
Airborne.
What the hell is he doing?
We have a strong wind condition.
Tell him to climb!
Climb, goddamn it! Climb!
Down! Everybody down!
...Add action of excitement,
or we change the direction
of the entire campaign.
Maybe we ought to rethink the visual
Holy shit.
Take the people secure,
a perimeter around the building.
I want everybody out of
this lobby right now, get around here.
Secure the elevators and stairs!
Anybody coming out, detain them!
What's going on?
We're going to the roof. Which elevator go to there?
Up there.
And the freight elevator?
Rear of the building.
That way.
Stan-man.
Take care of your little girl.
Maybe I'll see you around sometimes.
No! It 's not going to end like this.
Come on, Stan.
Not everything ends
as you think it should.
Besides, audiences love happy endings.
Stay here!
Shit! Come on.
Move, move!
No, Stanley!
Come on.
Get him out of here.
Secure that weapon.
Let's go.
Gentlemen.
You here to identify the body?
The body's dentals exactly match the dentals
the Israeli government sent us...
...for an ex-Mossad agent
named Gabriel Shear.
Excuse me, sir.
The DEA has no record of any
Ginger Knowles working for them.
And I checked all the hospitals and
morgues, and I still can't find her body.
Look again.
Bodies just don't disappear.
Right.
He could make an elephant
disappear in a theater full of people.
Do you know how he did that?
Misdirection.
I'm DEA, Stanley.
Give him the worm,
take the money and get out of here.
What the eyes see and the ears hear,
the mind believes.
Misdirection, Stan.
This is a bad guy.
Nobody's going to miss him.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
Look, why don't you get out of here?
Go see your daughter.
Yeah, thanks.
We'll be in touch.
You son of a bitch.
Thank you. You're done?
Yes, I'm full.
Good. Let's go.
So, navigator,
where's our next stop?
- Holbrook.
- Holbrook.
So what's in Holbrook?
The Petrified Forest, Dad.
Petrified Forest
I think you take the I-40 down to the 180.
Cool
All right.
Are you okay, Dad?
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.
Don't worry, Dad.
It's going to be okay.
We're going to be fine.
I know, honey.
I'd like to transfer money
from my employer's account.
May I have your account number
and password, please?
356127G.
Password: Swordfish.
How much would you like to transfer?
All of it. Evenly over these accounts.
It's done.
In international news,
terrorist Allal bin-Hazzad...
...was killed today
in an unexplained explosion on a yacht
in the Mediterranean.
The elusive bin-Hazzad
was thought responsible for...
...the American Embassy bombing
in Istanbul earlier this month.
This is the third killing of a
terrorist leader in as many weeks.
