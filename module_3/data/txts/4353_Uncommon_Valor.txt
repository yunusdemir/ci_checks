Aah!
Wait a minute.
He ain't dead!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Frank!
Come on, Frank.
Let's get the hell out!
Frank!
Frank!
Frank!
Hey, come back!
But on this joyous day,
one sobering question,
one haunting question remains.
Are they all back?
Still listed as
missing in action
are 2,500 American men.
Are any of them
still being held prisoner?
For the families
of those men,
the Vietnamese war
will never be over
until that question
is answered.
We're waiting
for the first P.O.W.
to emerge from the plane.
All of America waiting,
and in particular,
his family is waiting.
We'll see these heroes
emerging momentarily.
We're waiting now for,
on this momentous day,
the end of the war
officially fo rthem.
This day, March 7, 1973.
The first one
coming off now!
He looks a little thin,
but considering what
he's been through,
he looks very good
from here.
He's approaching
his family now.
We're waiting
for others to come off.
There's the official reunion.
The war is over for him.
For other American families,
the agonizing will continue
until they find out
the fate of their missing sons.
Daddy!
Daddy.
I'm scared.
Can I sleep
with you tonight?
Colonel Rhodes,
I sympathize, but-
I don't want
your sympathy!
I want you to help me
find my son.
But don't you understand?
There's nothing I can do.
There are 2,500 men
still unaccounted for.
There have been over
400 live sightings
of Americans held
against their will.
There's nothing I can do.
That's all I ever
heard in Washington.
Nobody can do anything.
That's why I came
to Bangkok.
Look, you didn't
hear this from me,
but there are a couple
of men here in Bangkok
who claim they've seen
American P.O.W.s in Laos.
I think my son's being
held prisoner in Laos,
but I need proof.
Get my son's signature
on the back of this picture.
Get my son's signature
on the back of that picture.
All right?
If I get your son's name here,
I want lots of money.
Yeah, O.K.
Hey, you.
O.K.
Hey!
Oh, boy. There's that old
Colonel M.I.A. again.
Hello, Colonel.
How are you?
Sorry we haven't
got time today,
but give me a ring
in my office.
Sorry.
Colonel Rhodes,
I can't help you with your son.
I'm trying to find food
for these new refugees.
Talk to that guy over there.
He'll help.
Thank you very much.
That your boy.
He prisoner in camp in Laos.
I smuggled the picture out.
I know my son's being held
somep lace in Northern Laos,
but I need to know
exactly where.
I need a thorough recon
of the area.
I can go into Laos
and North Vietnam.
I've got the connections.
But it'll take a lot of money
to find your son.
Don, hi!
How are you,Jason?
What do you have for me?
You know... ifthey
find out about this,
they'll retire me,
just like they retired you.
Yeah, yeah, O.K.
I suppose someone
could call this treason.
No. No, thanks.
It's a prison camp in Laos.
Look at the paddy dikes.
There's your proof,Jason.
There's your proof-111.
Go get your boy.
O.K.
Now, where was I?
Hey, Blaster.
Tell us about
that big wave.
I've told you guys
that story a thousand times.
I don't remember how I lied
the last time.
It doesn't matter.
It's still going to be bitchin'.
All right, all right.
The surf on
the north shore
comes up real fast.
You're out there
having fun,
and then it happens-
a life-threatening
experience.
And then?
This photograph
was taken
somewhere close
to where Frank is being held.
I'm not saying
Frank is one of them,
but those two
are Americans.
They're much too tall
to be Vietnamese.
Average Vietnamese man
is about 5'2-1/2".
And that's supposed
to be Frank?
That is Frank.
I bought too many fakes
over the last 10 years.
That definitely is Frank.
Been a P.O.W.
10 years in that shit hole?
Frank is alive.
You got that?
My son is alive.
Take a look at that.
That's a high altitude
photograph
taken from a SR-71.
Look closely.
Look at the paddy dikes.
The three lines there.
111.
That's your old
LRRP team designation-
First Battalion,
11 th Infantry.
Don't you see it?
Right here.
Yes.
That's three lines
in the ground.
It could be anything.
You know it isn't though,
don't you?
That's a message
from my son.
You know that.
Hello.
Hi.
Mrs. Wilkes?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm Jason Rhodes.
I phoned this morning.
Yeah, I know who you are.
Listen, my husband doesn't
want to talk to you.
I phoned him this morning,
and he said he did.
Not anymore.
Why don't you
do me a favor and go away?
Not until
I see your husband.
You've got no right
to be here.
It's taken me 10 years
to get that god damned war
out of his head.
Looks to me like
it's still in his head.
Ohh...
that's very deep.
Where were you
all the days
he spent staring
at the walls?
Hey, Wilkes!
Goddamn you!
Why did you send
your wife out here?
Don't you have
the guts to come out?
Leave him alone!
My son needs you!
At least look
at our photographs.
Wilkesy.
I'll handle this now.
I don't like your tactics.
But I'll listen
because of Frank.
O.K.
Blaster.
Wilkesy.
Why didn't you
stay in touch?
Why didn't you?
I don't know.
It's weird, ain't it?
How did they find you?
I don't know.
Came looking
and found me.
Then we found you.
Thanks a lot, Blast.
It's good
to see you, man.
There are compounds
all over Northern Laos.
There are choppers
we left behind.
We'll use them to get
into the P.O.W. camp.
They're used all the time,
so they should be
well maintained.
Excuse me, please.
You going out?
Mm-hmm.
Early, isn't it?
I want to make
happy hour.
Want to come along?
No. I think
I'll stay home tonight.
No kidding.
What's that mean?
It means, no kidding.
I don't feel like
going out.
He never feels like
doing anything.
That's not true.
Every night it's the same.
He listens to that crap.
That crap happens
to be George Gershwin.
It's like I'm not even here.
He's like a turtle
hiding in his shell.
He hasn't taken off
those sunglasses in six years.
I've given up trying
to figure him out.
Maybe you should take him
back to Vietnam.
He doesn't give a damn
about anything here.
It was nice meeting
you, Colonel.
Nice meeting you.
If he did go,
how much
would he be paid?
Nothing in dollars.
I haven't flown a helicopter
in a while.
I'd probably get
somebody killed.
There's unfinished business
over there, MajorJohnson.
Not mine.
Is this the Distinguished
Flying Cross?
Yeah.
How'd you get that?
Ah... pulling a cub pilot
out of Laos.
Must have been
more to it than that.
Not really.
Tell me about it.
I'd like to hear it.
I got him out
after a lot of good people
went down trying.
It was a hell ofa day.
We'd already lost
a good man named Hendricks,
couple of F-4jocks,
even Sandy Low Lead.
Lost a lot of good friends.
How many?
Oh, I don't remember.
It just seemed
like everybody.
You lost 11 men
and 9 aircraft.
You were shot down,
and you went back.
Why?
If you know that,
you tell me.
Why?
It was my job!
Right!
We couldn't let good men
die for nothing!
That's why we're
going back now.
Wait! Back up!
Don't lay that guilt on me!
No!
I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.
What do you
want from me?
I run half this hospital.
I'm off to Bermuda
next week
and not off
to some fantasy war.
I cannot save
the goddamn world!
At ease, Major.
MacGregor Oil.
Mr. MacGregor, please.
Mr. MacGregor's office.
This is Jason Rhodes
calling.
Jason, how's it going?
We're on our way.
How many?
Three. One chopper pilot
turned me down.
Is two enough?
I'll do it with one
if I have to.
I can't turn back now.
Is there anything more
I can do?
Just keep the cash coming.
I'll get our boys back.
What about Sailor?
He's in Houston.
I'm going there now.
The replica of
the P.O.W. camp is ready.
Great.
Keep in touch.
All right.
Talk to you.
Don't worry.
He can't see you.
It's a two-way mirror.
Your friend, Sailor,
blowtorched a local
kingpin biker.
We're holding him on our
witness protection program.
He come in here with
a grenade around his neck.
I don't think
his bread's quite done.
I had trouble
tracking you down.
You wandered around
the whole country.
Frank mentioned you
in his letters.
He said you were
the best man in the unit.
Yeah?
What the hell
happened to you?
I'm so far beyond
that shit now.
I get energy
from the air.
I talk to polar bears.
I converse with paramecium.
Man, I fuck nuclear waste!
Shit.
You guys will be
using real grenades.
They took mine.
Hey, look, asshole.
This is not
a bikers' acid trip.
This is a precise
military operation.
Frank was the best man
in anybody's unit.
I've got enough brain cells
to remember that.
You've got to
give me a shot, man.
You've got to.
Hey, Wilkesy.
Come on, man.
Sailor?
Ya-hoo!
My master!
You haven't changed a bit!
Master Wilkes!
Where's your grenade?
I used that for
an emergency enema.
Maybe I do have a little
unfinished business.
Besides, this guy wouldn't last
10 minutes without me.
You ain't bullshitting.
O.K.
Get aboard.
Well, gentlemen, this is it.
Exact replica
of the P.O.W. camp.
Who built it?
MacGregor's father.
Get your gear.
Stow it in that large tent.
I'll meet you here
in an hour for supper.
Mr. Ky, supper in one hour.
Thankyou.
Mr. Scott, at ease.
So, who the hell is that?
Good evening.
Hi. How are you?
Mr. Ky, you can serve
when you're ready.
Good evening.
As you were.
Since military courtesy
isn't practical here,
we'll dispense with it.
This is Kevin Scott.
He's well-trained in weapons
and training techniques.
And this is Mr. Ky.
We'll be eating Vietnamese food
from now on.
We don't want
to smell like Americans.
Any questions?
Good.
How long were you there?
I wasn't.
Too young.
Is he going with us?
Served in
Fourth Recon Marines.
Served?
I was discharged
for striking a radio operator
who fell asleep
at his post.
You're worried that I have
no combat experience.
You're right.
There's no way of proving
I won't fail in combat.
But you can't prove
that I will.
This is gonna be
a whole lot offun
with this one.
Gentlemen.
Thankyou for coming.
I knew you would come,
'cause you men
have got what it takes.
Molded over a little,
but you still got it.
There's a bond
between you men
as strong as the bond
between my son and me.
Of course, men who faced
death in battle
share the strongest bond.
You men seem to have
a strong sense of loyalty
because you're thought
of as criminals
because of Vietnam.
You know why?
Because you lost.
And in this country,
that's like
going bankrupt.
You're out of business.
They want to forget
about you.
You cost too much
and didn't turn a profit.
That's why they
won't get our buddies.
There's no gain in it.
We know the books
are still in the red.
The politicians know, too.
The same politicians
that never lost a son
in Vietnam.
They say they've
negotiated for 10 years.
Well...
the other side's
not buying.
And while the politicians
sit on their asses,
I'm asking you
to lay yours on the line.
Again.
Because, gentlemen...
we're the only hope
those P.O.W.s have.
So, we're going
back there.
And this time...
this time,
nobody can dispute
the rightness
of what we're doing.
Get down!
You're all dead.
Not quite, sir.
Go, Colonel.
Go, go, go!
Go! Go! Go!
Move it! Move it!
Move it!
Go! Go! Go!
Fuckin' pimp!
Go! Go! Go!
Blaster, go!
Come on, baby, go!
O.K. Come on, man.
Take it home!
Come on, Scott.
Go! Go, Sailor, go!
Come on, rookie!
All right, come on!
Go! Go, Sailor!
Hit it!
What are you doing?
You don't ever quit, boy.
Not when it's for real.
All right. That's enough.
Shit!
Damn!
Too much civilian life.
Pull it in!
O.K.! Move your butts!
Double time!
Good shooting, Colonel.
Blaster, your elbow down.
Yeah, yeah.
Sailor, stop spraying!
Conserve your ammo!
You haven't got
one in the kill zone!
These hands
were made to fly.
Tell the enemy when
he blows your head off!
Don't lose it, mister!
You kill the enemy,
asshole!
Sailor, I could teach
an undisciplined brawler
like you a lesson.
Make your move, boy.
Scott! A word, please.
Scott, these men
are seasoned veterans.
They can't be treated
like raw recruits.
You have to earn
their respect.
Yes, sir.
Wilkesy's
claustrophobic as shit.
He was the tunnel rat
in our unit.
Goes down a tunnel
to check for
weapon storage.
Turns out there's
somebody down there.
He knifes them both
in the dark.
Then the shells hit.
He's stuck until
we dig him out.
Wilkes lights a match
to move the bodies
off of him.
He'd knifed some
woman and her kid.
Killed them
deader than shit.
Jesus.
Wilkes starts freaking.
We can hear him
screaming,
but he has to stay
with those corpses
until we dig him out.
You come in low
under his line of sight.
You leap...
taking him down,
placing your hand
over his nose,
pulling his face away.
At the base of his skull,
you insert,
scramble the brains-
Instant rag doll.
Most human problems
can be solved
by a charge
of high explosive.
In today's lesson,
we'll learn to set a series.
Follow me.
The idea is to create
a linked series of disasters.
Figure evasive moves
from each blast,
and plant
your next tomato.
Just as we're
coming up here,
they'd trip
charge number one.
Boom!
Column splits in two.
Half here, half there.
Over here, number two
will set their ass on fire.
They think they're safe.
They get away!
Boom! Number three
blows their balls off.
Number four!
They come over here.
They find
a two-pound charge.
Boom!
Number five.
Quick fuse grenade.
Not a big bang,
but it does a good job.
Anybody left will think,
"We've got to make it. "
They're coming out
and run into charge six.
Claymore mine.
End of story.
Congratulations, Sailor.
You wasted a prisoner.
He's a collaborator.
You all right?
Can't sleep, huh?
Foryears, I couldn't sleep
after Korea.
My nightmares
all had to do
with the Chosin Reservoir.
The ground there
was so frozen
we couldn't bury
our dead.
Piled them on trucks and
lashed them against tanks.
For years, I'd wake up
with those frozen faces
staring at me.
Did it ever go away?
No.
I finally made friends
with them though.
No.
Left.
No.
Left, right, left.
No.
Get together, guys!
Gentlemen!
The object
of the next exercise-
Get from here
to the bridge
without being tagged
by Wilkes.
Shit.
Sneaky little shit.
Aw, shit. I'm dead.
Wilkesy, I'm supposed-
Shit!
Shit!
Fuck, man.
Come on!
Come on. Come on.
You can make it.
Come across.
You people got caught
'cause you got careless.
I told you-
All right, Wilkesy!
All right, Wilkesy!
The object
was not to get caught!
That guy's elevator
doesn't go to the top.
Agent Orange.
No. Red wine and uppers.
That's why he's called Sailor.
He'd take red wine and uppers
and sail away.
How come he wears
that grenade?
Sailor says
if life got shitty,
he'd pull the pin.
@@@ To be where I'mgoing@@@
Wilkesy,
remember that song?
Get down, boogie,
remember?
Yeah!
Boogie! Come on.
Come on,
remember that?
Come on, Wilkesy.
Hey, Blaster.
Yeah! Come on!
Come on,Johnson!
Get out here.
Come on,Johnson!
Go for it!
Do it, boy!
@ I'll stay with you,
darling, now @
@ I'll stay with you
till my seed sare dried up @
Agent Orange.
All Agent Orange.
@... waitingso long @
@ To be where I'm going @
@ In the sunshine
of your love @
O.K., Curtis.
Follow the leader.
Sounds good to me.
Close it up!
Let's go!
Fly this thing!
Get your Sierra together,
my man.
Kiss my Sierra, buddy.
You were
the ace of the base.
Getting too old, buddy?
Looking good, guys.
Looking good.
Left, right, left.
Left, left,
left, right, left.
Shit!
What the fuck
am I doing here?
Come on! Don't quit!
Fuckyou!
We have to work
together-everybody!
I don't believe
this motherfuckin' shit!
I've been workin'
my ass off,
and I don't need
no wet-nosed asshole
screaming in my face!
Back off!
Curtis!
Let the shit ride!
We're on the same team!
We have to work together!
We are the team,
asshole.
We were there,
not you.
Now, asshole.
Right now!
Sailor, Colonel Rhodes
was wrong.
I can't earn your respect,
'cause you have
no respect for yourself.
Boy...
you just bought the whole
can ofwhoop-ass.
Come on, Sailor!
Kick his ass, Sailor!
Boy, using that yellow
martial bullshit on me
is going to get
real expensive.
Get up!
Come on, hero!
That's enough, Sailor!
Get up, boy!
You can't keep me
from this mission!
Why are you getting up,
marine?
Stay down, man.
Stay down!
Stay down, little fucker.
No! No!
Why you wanna
go die, boy?
Why?
I'll tell you why.
His father's
missing in action...
shot down in Vietnam,
that's why.
Blaster, when I come
over the treeline
at 0300,
that's your cue to blow up
the radio tower,
then the bridge to cut off
reinforcements from the village.
Boom...
Mister Scott,
that's your cue
to neutralize
guard tower "A".
All right,
Charts,Johnson...
you pick up Blaster after
we've snatched the prisoners.
Major Johnson,
you pick up Scott.
O.K., Blaster,
this is the big ride.
All right, Sailor!
Gentlemen, study every
inch of this compound.
It's an exact reproduction
ofthe P.O.W. camp in Laos.
It's imperative
that we're in and out
in less than
three minutes.
The lives of everyone
involved may depend on it.
We're rehearsing so we can
do this operation in our sleep.
10 days time, we'll have
a live fire exercise.
Look, we have been pursuing
diplomatic negotiations
for the release
of all P.O.W.s,
if there are any.
An armed incursion now
would undermine
those negotiations.
It's been 10 years!
They'll be dead
by the time you negotiate!
Damn it, as my friend,
call Rhodes
and drop this project!
Look, I didn't want it
to get this far.
You know, they're prepared
to take serious measures
against your company-
I.R.S. audits,
anti-trust suits...
Fuck you, Art.
The men we're going after
will be in rough shape...
something like these men.
They may not
be able to walk.
They may not
want to walk.
They will be shattered...
both physically...
and emotionally.
After all these years,
they may not be able
to speak English.
Remember, gentlemen,
everything we do tonight...
is motivated...
by them.
It looked like
the Fourth of July!
It was beautiful!
It was gorgeous!
Gentlemen!
Mr. MacGregor.
I wanted to thank you
personally.
After watching you,
I know Jason's chosen
the right men for the job.
And as a token
of my esteem,
a check and pocket money
for Bangkok.
Take it.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Do you ever regret
letting Frank go,Jason?
He was in the service.
There wasn't any question.
Couldn't your Washington contacts
get him stationed elsewhere?
When there's war,
the Rhodes fight.
We lost almost the whole family
at Gettysburg.
That's all we're good at.
Haven't always been real good
at fighting, either.
A lot of us been killed.
But we're always there.
You know,Jason...
I'd give everything
I have-everything...
for just one hour with him.
See if that's our truck.
There's a C.I.A. man for sure.
Johnson, Rhodes...
you're in a shit pile
oftrouble.
We're confiscating
your weapons.
My orders are to put you
in jail- a Bangkok jail.
I don't want to put
an old soldier like you in jail,
but damn it,
this scheme of yours is crazy.
Shit!
Get on the next plane home.
And don't go back
to the hotel.
They're waiting
for your ass there, too.
Since our government's
confiscated our weapons,
I'm not going to ask
you gentlemen to go any further.
It's over!
I'm not giving up
to those bastards.
My son Frank's
waiting for me.
I'll go in there
with a pocket knife!
You people do whatever
you want, O.K.?
There's got to be someplace
in Bangkok to get guns.
No. Up north
in the Golden Triangle.
We need money for that!
What about the C.I.A.?
Who cares?
It's a total wipe-out!
We've got money.
That's right.
The money
MacGregor gave us.
Everybody give it up.
Come on, all of it.
That's all I got.
What you been doin'?
Seeing the sights.
Wilkes, we're going
to need transportation.
4- wheel drive?
Preferably.
Buy it or borrow it?
Steal the fucker!
Left. Left!
Hey!
Some other fella's moved in
on your man's drug operation.
Even moved
into his house.
We can find him
down the street.
Colonel Rhodes.
Sit down.
Jiang, how are you?
I understand you've
had some trouble.
The misfortunes
of the narcotics world.
I barely escaped
with my life.
Do you still have men
to take us into Northern Laos?
I'll take you myself.
I'm weary of this life
of uselessness.
Jiang, we need weapons.
We need
cheap weapons now.
We lost ours in Bangkok,
understand?
No, we don't
have time to eat.
I'll bet you'll approve
of our cuisine.
At this restaurant,
you can eat well or poorly,
depending on how
you order your meal.
What does monsieur
recommend?
All our cuisine
is exceptional.
But there are
seasonal specials.
$5,000.
$4,000.
$3,000.
These dishes require
24-hour notice.
Monsieur, these entrees
are too rich for our blood.
Come on.
Uncle Mich!
Brother Bud!
Sorry. The wrong department.
Bargain basement's this way.
How much for the beer?
Compliments ofthe house.
Ah, yes.
I'll give you the whole lot for,
let's say...
No.
$6,000.
Let's say $4,000.
You're cheap.
Garbage.
Thank you.
High and to the right.
High and to the right.
Hit.
Gentlemen,
these are my daughters.
They will accompany us
into Laos.
Unfortunately,
I have no sons to offer you.
They were killed by Laotian
Red Guards during opium run.
However, Colonel Rhodes,
I am certain my daughters
will prove themselves worthy.
O.K., let's go, gentlemen.
We're back.
I'm just trying
to stay warm.
I swear to God.
Jiang.
What happened here?
Ypres.
What?
Ypres.
What's he talking about?
It's French.
A town in France.
The first place the Germans
ever used mustard gas.
Oh, yeah.
Yellow rain.
Hmong people
fight Vietnamese.
Vietnamese hate them.
Laotian Border Patrol.
Get the recoilless rifle
right now.
He thinks
we're opium dealers.
They want our cargo.
Offer him a bribe.
Anything. Stall.
They want to inspect
our packs.
This'll get terminal in a hurry.
You ready,Johnson?
Ready.
Now!
Scott, god damn it,
man your weapon!
Damn it!
Two ofthem got away!
Colonel.
Sir, we lost one RPG,
six grenades,
and a radio is damaged.
It'll receive,
but the transmitter's shot.
Mr. Jiang.
We...
come.
We must continue on.
No further words are
necessary, Colonel Rhodes.
Since we don't have
night vision gear,
we'll change to 0600
instead of 0300.
We're able to
receive your verification
about the P.O.W.s,
but you'll have to assume
we've gotten the choppers.
Wait till you
hear us coming.
Ground team,
you're up that trail.
Air team,
follow me down this creek.
Well, that's it.
It's game time.
I've forgotten
the speech I prepared.
There are some lines
from Julius Caesar.
"If a man were to know
"the end of this day's
business ere it come,
"but it suffices
that the day will end,
"and then
the end be known.
"If we meet again,
"then we'll smile.
"And if not,
well, then,
this parting was well made. "
It should be
right over that hill.
Come on.
Quietly.
Down.
Drop your packs.
It looks deserted.
You think
they moved them?
Quite possible.
Rice down there
has been harvested.
I'll take a look.
I'll look at that bridge.
Couldn't find a way in.
It's walled all around.
Look at this.
What?
O.K., Wilkesy, I'll go.
No, no, no.
I'll be waiting for you
when you come out.
O.K., Wilkesy?
Take this.
It'll help protect you.
Help!
Wilkesy, you all right?
What's wrong, man?
It's O.K.
It's not poisonous.
Yeah.
That charm took care ofyou.
I don't believe it!
The chopper compound
isn't here.
They must have moved
the goddamn thing.
Give me the map.
Cover!
All right, let's go.
Let's move.
Laotian regulars.
Prisoners.
They must've been
working across the river.
That's why
we didn't see them.
Jesus, Wilkes!
He spotted me.
You almost
got me spotted.
I saw an American.
I saw three.
Alcatraz, this is Sing Sing.
BMX.
We've struck oil.
I repeat, BMX.
We've struck oil.
Hold it! Hold it!
They're there!
The P.O.W.s.
They're there!
Jesus Christ.
They're there!
O.K.
Let's find those choppers.
It could've been Frank.
I just don't know.
We will know
soon enough.
Well, I've got some
nocturnal planting to do.
Scott, good luck.
Jiang.
Wilkesy, let's go.
Colonel,
we've got to move faster.
There's a lot of jungle
to cover
between that base and us.
Come on.
Where is it?
I know it came down
in this area.
Hurry.
It's almost dawn.
All right.
They're asleep.
Let's get them
before they wake up.
Charts and Sailor,
take the barracks.
I'll take the officers' quarters.
Mr. Charts
must fly the helicopter.
He cannot risk injury.
I will go in first
with Mr. Sailor.
Charts?
O.K.
They should be
on their way.
Get out of here!
Let's go!
Hands up!
Charts... Charts!
Get the gunship!
Johnson, in the Huey!
Hold them right here,
Sailor!
Lai Fun, stay with Sailor!
Battery!
Fucking Reds!
I'll cover!
Johnson's chopper
took another hit!
Spot for me.
I got a guy.
200 meters,
top of the ridge,
left of the tree.
Right, two meters!
Got him!
All right!
Baby!
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, Sailor!
Charts! Lai Fun!
O.K., fucker!
You're history, pal.
Charts, are you with me?
Right behind you.
Johnson, are you with me?
Right on you, Colonel!
Shit.
Where are they?
You cannot let them
cross the bridge!
What if they don't show?
They are coming.
Don't let them
reach the bridge!
Fire in front of them.
Fire!
You ain't crossing
that fucking bridge.
It's still there!
Goddamn caps!
Aah!
Hiyah!
Hah!
Come on, bastards!
Come and get it!
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six!
A new record!
Seven!
Yeah! Eight!
Unbelievable!
We can get them out!
Oh, my God!
Yaah!
Whoo! Damn it!
Coming in on the tower.
Son of a bitch!
We've been hit!
Hold on!
Gun'sjammed, Colonel!
I'll take out the tower.
O.K., boss!
We're going to hit heavy!
Colonel!
Wilkes, give me a hand.
Jesus Christ!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
We saw four Americans,
one in your building!
Go! Go! Go!
Frank!
Come on, buddy.
We're going home.
I can't.
The garden.
We'll take it with us.
It's all right.
Come on. It's O.K.
Let's go.
Frank? Frank?
It's O.K., soldier.
It's all right.
It's O.K.
No!
Come on, let's go.
Home?
Home for real?
Yeah! Come on!
Any more rounds
for the recoilless?
Jiang?
Holy shit!
Eeeyaahhh!
I'll kill you,
you motherfuckers!
Charts! This way!
Move it! Move it!
Come on, man!
Go, go, go!
There's no sign
of number four.
Where's the other
American?
What's he saying?
In the pit.
Where's the pit?
Give me a count of 60,
then go.
We can't leave anybody
behind this time.
Leave, or everybody
will get left behind!
Frank!
MacGregor?
Wilkes, cover me.
Run, Colonel, run!
Run.
Head for the chopper!
We'll be wiped out!
Come on!
God damn it!
Wilkes!
Leave it!
Come on! Come on!
Where's Sailor?
He's bought it!
He's dead!
Sailor! Sailor!
Eeeyaaah!
Come on, man.
Come on.
Where's Blaster?
God damn it!
Mr. Charts!
Mr. Scott! Come!
Come quickly!
This way!
Charts, come on!
We got to hustle!
Come on!
Mayday! Mayday!
American M.I.A.s on board!
Mayday! Mayday!
Chartsy, give me
a hand up here.
Mayday! Mayday!
American M.I.A.s
on board!
It's really good...
to see you.
Frank...
He got sick.
So sick.
I tried to help him.
He died.
He saved my life
that day.
He saved my life.
