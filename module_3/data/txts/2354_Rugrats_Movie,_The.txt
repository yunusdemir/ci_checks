Tommy ...
Come on, Chuckiel
Tommy, you kids
shouldn't be playing in here.
We thOught the fun tiMeS
wOuld laSt fOrever.
But we waS wrOng.
- oh, my ...
- Upsy-daisy, didi.
Thank you for iniiting me
to your baby shower, mrs Pickles.
- Glad you could be here, Suzy.
- what a pretty dress, Angelica.
my mummy's assistant bought it
especially for Aunt didi's party.
don't say a word.
$20 on 8 pounds, 6 ounces.
who's got 8-7?
- 12 pounds, are you crazy?.
- y ou can't see she's gained weight.
l mean, from behind.
Look what we got for you.
Boris, moie your tuchiSl
A goat?
mum, you shouldn't haie.
Nothing better for her
than goat's milk.
Except maybe yak. But you try
finding good yak these days.
Here you go, kinderlach,
some chocolate coins.
- Aren't you gonna eat it, Tommy?.
- l'm saiing it for my baby sister.
- She finally came?
- Not yet.
But they're giiing her this party,
so l'm pretty sure today's the day.
do you think she got losted
on the way to the party?.
maybe we should look for her.
- Come on.
- But she could be anywhere.
- watch it, pups.
- Careful.
- How's our little man?
- dr Lipschitz says it's a girl.
That windbag thought
Phil and Lil were intestinal gas.
- ''Riding high, it's a guy.''
- y ou know what they say:
''Born under Venus, look for a ...''
dr Lipschitz is the expert.
None of you haie a Ph. d. in Latin.
Pig Latin, maybe. Let's just hope
for Tommy's sake it's a girl.
How my pups would squabble
if they were both boysl
Let's not do any
gender stereotyping. After all, -
- Stu and drew are brothers,
and they get along fine.
- Pushyl Bossyl
- Lazyl lnconsideratel
- why can't you listen to me?
- we're talking about a real job.
l'm not gonna waste my life as a
clock-punching, paper-pushing ...
No offence.
y ou got no insurance, no saiings
and another kid on the way.
For your information, bro,
l am working on something now -
- that will put this branch of the
Pickles family on easy street.
- what now, an electric sponge?
- of course not. That was last year.
This is the Reptar wagonl
The ultimate in toddler
transportation. The perfect toyl
ln my day, we had plenty of fun
just throwing rocks at each other.
The Reptar Corp is holding
a toy-design contest.
The winner gets $500.
There'll be plenty more if this toy
is a hit. And l'll be famousl
That's what you said
when you built that stupid thing.
maybe ducktar was a little complex.
But this ... watchl
l am Reptar. Hear me roar.
l aM Reptar. Hear Me rOar.
Can't a man work in his own basement
without getting barbecued?
okay, so maybe real fire isn't
the best idea for a children's toy.
Tommy,
somebody's been colouring your room.
y up, it's for my new sister.
- How are we gonna find her?.
- we don't know what she looks like.
well, she's a girl like me,
so we know she'll be prettyful.
y ou babies got a lot to learn
about the facts of life.
l must get back to the dessert table
before the grown-ups eat it all.
Angelica, can you help us
find my baby sister?.
l wouldn't be in such a hurry.
when she gets here, she'll get all
the toys and loie and attention.
y our mummy and daddy
will forget all about you.
''Look, didi, there's that little
bald kid in the house again.''
- my mum and dad won't forget me.
- That's what Spike said.
- Back when his name was Paul.
- Paul?
Then you came. They put him out in
the rain and he turned into a dog.
That's not gonna happen to me.
my mum and dad will always loie me.

we could take dill to the hopsicle,
and get Tommy's money back.

once dill goes back to the
baby store Tommy will be happy.
l don't know about this.

you got a naughty baby brother.
He's not naughty.
He's just ... a baby.
How can you be mad
just because ...
... you're standing there
all naked?
l'm sure he's just trying to help.
lt's hot,
exploring in the woods all day.
A little breeze feels good.
Just what l needed.
Thank you, dill.
Those hiccups
are starting to bug me.
Face it, haiing a baby brother
isn't what you expected.
Look, somebody's house.
Tommy was right.
my sponsatiiity does work.

- Thank Bob.
Come on, guys.

The monkeys took baby dill. would

Find your brother by yourself.

- what a pretty dress, Angelica.
my mummy's assistant bought it
especially for Aunt didi's party.
don't say a word.
$20 on 8 pounds, 6 ounces.
who's got 8-7?
- 12 pounds, are you crazy?.
- y ou can't see she's gained weight.
l mean, from behind.
Look what we got for you.
Boris, moie your tuchiSl
A goat?
mum, you shouldn't haie.
Nothing better for her
than goat's milk.
Except maybe yak. But you try
finding good yak these days.
Here you go, kinderlach,
some chocolate coins.
- Aren't you gonna eat it, Tommy?.
- l'm saiing it for my baby sister.
- She finally came?
- Not yet.
But they're giiing her this party,
so l'm pretty sure today's the day.
do you think she got losted
on the way to the party?.
maybe we should look for her.
- Come on.
- But she could be anywhere.
- watch it, pups.
- Careful.
- How's our little man?
- dr Lipschitz says it's a girl.
That windbag thought
Phil and Lil were intestinal gas.
- ''Riding high, it's a guy.''
- y ou know what they say:
''Born under Venus, look for a ...''
dr Lipschitz is the expert.
None of you haie a Ph. d. in Latin.
Pig Latin, maybe. Let's just hope
for Tommy's sake it's a girl.
How my pups would squabble
if they were both boysl
Let's not do any

l'm not gonna waste my life as a
clock-punching, paper-pushing ...
No offence.
y ou got no insurance, no saiings
and another kid on the way.
For your information, bro,
l am working on something now -
- that will put this branch of the
Pickles family on easy street.
- what now, an electric sponge?
- of course not. That was last year.
This is the Reptar wagonl
The ultimate in toddler
transportation. The perfect toyl
ln my day, we had plenty of fun
just throwing rocks at each other.
The Reptar Corp is holding
a toy-design contest.
The winner gets $500.
There'll be plenty more if this toy
is a hit. And l'll be famousl
That's what you said
when you built that stupid thing.
maybe ducktar was a little complex.
But this ... watchl
l am Reptar. Hear me roar.
l aM Reptar. Hear Me rOar.
Can't a man work in his own basement
without getting barbecued?
okay, so maybe real fire isn't
the best idea for a children's toy.
Tommy,
somebody's been colouring your room.
y up, it's for my new sister.
- How are we gonna find her?.
- we don't know what she looks like.
well, she's a girl like me,
so we know she'll be prettyful.
y ou babies got a lot to learn
about the facts of life.
l must get back to the dessert table
before the grown-ups eat it all.
Angelica, can you help us
find my baby sister?.
l wouldn't be in such a hurry.
when she gets here, she'll get all
the toys and loie and attention.
y our mummy and daddy
will forget all about you.
''Look, didi, there's that little
bald kid in the house again.''
- my mum and dad won't forget me.
- That's what Spike said.
- Back when his name was Paul.
- Paul?
Then you came. They put him out in
the rain and he turned into a dog.
That's not gonna happen to me.
my mum and dad will always loie me.

He's not naughty.
He's just ... a baby.
How can you be mad
just because ...
... you're standing there
all naked?
l'm sure he's just trying to help.
lt's hot,
exploring in the woods all day.
A little breeze feels good.
Just what l needed.
Thank you, dill.
Those hiccups
are starting to bug me.
Face it, haiing a baby brother
isn't what you expected.
Look, somebody's house.
Tommy was right.
my sponsatiiity does work.

- Thank Bob.
Come on, guys.
we're off to see the lizard.
- Are you okay?.
