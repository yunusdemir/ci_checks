Man: Let's get ready
to rock and roll.
Tally atwater, affiliate promo,
stand by, take 1.
Man 2: Ok, people,
let's get it together.
Gimme tally on 1.
I want to hear the announce.
We'll take the
announce and tally.
Let me hear the announce...
Man 3: Testing 1, 2, 3.
This is tom orr.
Testing 1, 2, 3.
We got tally on 1.
Orr: You know those faces.
You remember those stories.
They were the men and women
who made ibs news...
Man: Ok, ok, that's
enough on tom orr.
Let's go to tally.
Tally, could you give us a
level on your Mike, please?
Tally: What we in the news
business can never forget...
one second. Raise
her gain a little bit.
Again, tally. Testing 1, 2, 3.
What we in the news business
can never forget...
man: You're picking up
shadow on her face.
Tally, I need to see you right
at camera here, please.
Woman: I'll make sure
we get food in here.
Add some side light, please?
What we in the news business
can never forget
is we're only as good
as the stories we tell.
Guys, guys, you still
got the shadow.
A little more fill, please.
If you could just talk a little bit
about how you got started, tally.
A few bio bites that, you
know, we can play with.
Let's... let's shoot this.
Let's see.
I guess I always pretty much
knew what I wanted to do.
Woman: Sally Ann knew
exactly what she wanted.
And what she wanted
was to be number one...
In neon lights.
Man: The sister comes
down to 2 bites, Max.
Something cute about
how you got started...
What, you went to college?
I temped, waited tables...
The minute I was old enough,
I dealt craps.
Craps.
I wanted to deal baccarat, because
you could make more money on tips,
but where we were living...
in a little mining town
in the west...
you have to be connected
to deal baccarat,
and the only person
I was connected to
was my little sister luanne.
I was going to community
college at night,
doubling up on
communications courses,
making up for lost time...
Everyone said, "you want to
get a job in television,
you have to make a demo tape."
So I made a demo tape.
You might ask, out of the
thousands of young women
that send you tapes,
why hire Sally?
I sent it to 37 stations.
Wmia Miami, um,
was the only answer I got.
So I said good-bye to luanne
and got on a connection to Dallas
with a 4-hour layover to Miami.
I wanted it to be 4 days... I
was so scared of getting there.

So... You're Sally.
Sally atwater.
That's Sally
with an "s," right?
Do you think I'm overdressed?
No. Not in the least.
I didn't know if they'd
be dressy or cool...
Warren, miss atwater is here.
Ok. Go up those stairs,
and Warren's
in the control booth.
Hey... I'm ned.
I'm Sally.
You majored in communications.
Yeah, Vic, listen...
Wrap Patty, go to rob.
Rob, back to you in the studio.
Thank you, Patty,
for that report.
You, over here.
Rob, you're running long.

Still holds his
math class hostage...
Full coverage at 6:00 from the
award-winning channel 9 news team...
Full coverage at 6:00
from the award winning...
This is rob Sullivan...
with his touchy-feely tag...
good-bye. Be of good cheer.
Good-bye. Be of good cheer.
I might get sick.
Get me the 6:00 report.
Come on.
Warren, about
the Anders thing...
coming, sweetheart?
I think the way we play it
is by calling attention
to a public servant
violating the voters' trust.
No, Harvey,
we play it straight...
Harvey Harris reporting from
the dade county courthouse
where today seminole school
principal Lee Anders
was found guilty of banging the
10th grade class president.
No more, no less. Got it?
More on that accident
in homestead...
sweetheart, will you keep up?
Sally.
Excuse?
I said Sally, not sweetheart.
Got it.
Vic, Sally.
Sally's our new desk assistant.
Do not call her sweetheart.
There's got to be a kid
trapped in the wreckage
before we do a break-in.
No kid. Dad, mom,
grandma in one car.
The driver, his wife or
girlfriend in the pickup.
There's some discrepancy there.
Run that discrepancy by me.
Lady calls, says
the woman in the pickup
was her husband's whore,
quote, unquote.
Warren, Trish again on 2.
Trish?
Yeah. We'll send you
references.
Yes.
Weren't you and Trish...
You know, if you don't
mind my asking...
I do mind. Who you
got on homestead?
Nobody...
Unless you want to fire Trish.
We... we don't, uh,
we don't usually wear
our credentials
in the newsroom.
Oh, sorry.
Oh!
I'm so sorry.
Oh, that's good.
I'm sorry.
Ahem.
I'm from Nevada.
Ok. Here's the rundown.
Ahem.
We'll have the kid
hostage story live...
no, not live. By 6:00 it'll
be "what does it all mean?"
Have Lou do it.
Ok. Consuela's doing the pba endorsing
the mayor for a second term.
Bury that before
the first commercial.
Harvey's doing Anders,
and there's the cocoa plum
housekeeper killing.
Lead with that. Because...
Come on, let's have it.
The golden rule of local news...
if it...
I don't...
bleeds, it leads.
Your predecessor...
Trish.
Trish didn't think the desk
had a whole lot to teach her.
How 'bout you?
Oh, I think the desk
can teach me.
What?
Everything.
Everything?
So that later when I'm...
So when I'm ready, I'll
be able to do a story.
Excuse me a second.
Oh.
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is a great honor, and...
Already a seasoned newswoman.
She covered the crucial
California youth forum...
crucial California youth
forum election, huh?
You might ask, out of the thousands
of young women that send you tapes,
why hire Sally?
Because I'm Sally,
and I'm going to be a star.
If this is to tell me
I have a lot to learn,
I already know that.
I'm going to learn it.
Noted.
Meanwhile, you answer the
phones, work the database,
get the reporters
what they need...
addresses, numbers,
who, what, when, where...
oh, and you see that
Mr. Coffee machine over there?
I like it strong.
Ileana, cancel my dinner.
We're gonna have to go late.
You used to cover
the white house.
Are you gonna tell me you
watched me in high school?
No. You were the one who asked George
Bush how, as former CIA director,
he didn't know noriega
was on the CIA payroll.
And bush said, "no
questions at photo op,"
and marlin fitzwater
said, "pull the lights,"
and you put the whole
thing on the air.
It was in a course I took.
Y... right. You still
get the coffee.
I could probably
get the coffee.
Good.
Otherwise, you just had
the shortest career
in wmia channel 9 history,
news heartbeat of
the American riviera.
Sugar, no cream.
Do you always wear
that much makeup?
Turning to the weather front...
Newsroom.
Can I have your name, please?
What is the name
of the hospital?
Does this person have a name?
No... I<i> am</i> trying to help you.
Uh, no, ma'am, I do not
remember Miami
before there were Haitians.
Thank you, ma'am.
Happy Halloween to you, too.
Looks like you're
getting the hang of it.
Uh, I am. Yes.
Actually, I've been getting the
hang of it since at least July.
Here you go, Warren.
Thanks. Good, ned.
This is not a criticism.
It's... More of an observation.
You don't have
a weather person.
I fired her.
I don't like weather persons.
But having the anchor
do the weather
reduces his credibility
as anchor.
Credibility? Rob?
If you wanted
someone to do it...
you think you might
be ready to...
take on a little more...
responsibility?
Exactly.
Heh...
I'm ready.
Oh, you know what
you are ready for?
Stop tomorrow morning
on your way in...
my cleaning... shun li.
You want a ride home?
Otherwise I have just had
the shortest career
in the history of
wmia channel 9,
news heartbeat
of the American riviera.
The ride home is optional.
I opt no, thank you.
You want rob to wear that?
You know, weather
is a sponsored spot.
Well, what if it's
not raining, Dan?
Any other costume ideas on tap?
I was thinking
maybe big sunglasses.
Shit. Warren,
3 has happy weather.
Do you know what kind
of an operation 3 is?
The night the Gulf war started,
they led with the bal-harbor
winter wonderland shop-a-thon.
And 3 was then and still is the
top-rated station in this market.
What could it cost
to try this? Come on...
It would cost you nothing.
Gimme a second.
I said I wanted them boxed.
They still don't come boxed.
Listen, I was watching
the news last night...
is that unusual?
And I have an idea
about something.
I was rethinking
the weather spot.
Yeah. Everybody is.
I could do it.
I could do the weather.
I could do the desk and
the weather, same salary.
If I could restate my point...
I got your point.
Salary to one side, Sally.
I did some weather in Reno.
I wanted to hire
a regular weather,
an Arnie poole type.
San Francisco's
got Arnie poole.
We've got rob.
All I ask is to
let rob try this.
The weather in Reno...
Let's see they... they must
get some genuine weather?
Oh, big-time.
Warren, you prove me
wrong, I'm easy.
Dan...
Meet our new weather person.
Really? Ha ha!
Really?
This is Dan duarte,
our station manager
and my boss.
I go through life with a smile,
try to spread
a little goodness.
Some people in this
business get jaded,
because it's always
the same awful stories.
And it is the same stories,
but they're happening
to different people.
Our new weather gal seems
to be under the weather.
30 seconds, rob.
Ok, now we're clearing...
focus on spreading
that goodness, huh, rob?
Uhhhh...
What is this?
Ok, come on, get up.
Come on...
Now... now, what is it?
Oh, I can't do it.
Come on, you've done this before.
What's wrong?
If you're Sally, I want you
in makeup now, please.
Not now.
Stay outside.
Hey...
Say "Sally atwater."
Sally...
Sally...
Say it.
Sally at... again.
No, I can't do it!
Then don't do it.
You don't have to do it.
Yes, I do.
What?
Yes, I do.
Ok. I'll get you through it.
Man: Hello, miss. My name is octavio.
I'm your floor manager.
You're going to be
in camera the entire time.
Welcome to Mia. Ok, everybody,
happy weather in 15, 14...
Man: Ok, everybody,
keep on your toes.
Let's do this one
for Uncle Dan.
Can we have it quiet
in here, please?
Rob, check the prompter.
And now with the weather,
here's sa... tally atwater.
Tally?
Warren: Come on, that's
your new name... tally.
It's easy to say. Don't look
at me, look at the camera.
You got 29 seconds
to commercial.
Look straight into the camera,
talk straight into
the red light.
You'll find you've got
a new best friend.
Tally?
Come on, baby.
Tally...
Thanks, rob.
How long was that?
We need to take...
You won't need this.
What an idea.
You will want these...
Oh, another good idea, Dan.
We're looking at
an expected high of 98...
Those glasses don't
seem silly on 7.
Does she come out
next with a banana?
Look for a balmy low of 86.
Pick it up.
More high pressure moving in
means that this system is
definitely staying with us.
Pace yourself.
Don't look at me.
Look at the camera.
And so the 5-day forecast is
more, more, more, hot, hot, hot.
Thtay...
stay inside,
cuddle up.
Cuddle up and enjoy
the air conditioning, rob.
Thanks, tally...
You made your point, Warren.
This is a nonstarter.
She eats the lens.
That does it for now.
This is rob Sullivan saying,
for adela Simms and myself and all
of us here at channel 9 news,
good night. Be of good cheer.
Won't want this.
Will need these.
Not to worry, Dan.
Uncle rob was there to
step in if it got any worse.
Man: Good job, Sally.
I was betting she'd
pee on the air.
Man: Ok, guys, we'll do it
again tomorrow, ok? Thanks.
You don't have to
put up with him, lu.
Luanne... I... I... I hear it,
I hear it.
No, it is not the guy
from the sweepstakes.
Nobody but you believes in the
guy from the sweepstakes.
It's like the tooth fairy.
Don't hang up. I
want to talk to you.
Still feeling
sorry for yourself?
What are you doing here?
Oh... nbc's million dollar
baby and how she got there.
No<i> Miami herald,</i>
no<i> Washington post,</i>
no<i> wall street journal?</i>
You getting a cheap
rush from this?
You know the demo
tape I sent you?
Yeah.
I faked it.
Mm-hmm.
I didn't do any of those
things I said I did.
I went to east Reno
community college at night.
I wasn't valedictorian.
I didn't even graduate.
I faked the whole graduation.
I rented a cap and gown,
I did the camera myself,
I even threw
the confetti myself.
No crucial California
youth forum elections?
Big-time weather? Freelance?
Once when I was working
at, um, um, Cal-neva,
it got snowed in, and a Reno
station asked for some...
Reports... phone reports,
and I did one.
It was 40 seconds long.
I know all that.
You think I didn't
check it out?
So fire me.
I figure if you're hungry
enough to fake it,
you might be hungry
enough to do it.
The weather is not gonna work.
Ha. You don't think
I know that?
You come across on camera.
You made a save.
I'm giving you a
shot as a reporter.
That's what I came
by to tell you.
Thought I came by to
fuck you, didn't ya?
Lu.
I think I just got promoted.
Actually, this is a set-aside.
Harvey's belle-glade
piece tells me a story.
Yours doesn't.
Miami's beautiful people
got an eyeful today...
What's the story?
The story is...
the fashion industry
comes to South beach.
It came...
It went.
We did that story. It's gone.
Ok, now, let's lay in b-roll.
See if we can't
salvage this thing.
Some of the finest
cigarmakers exiled from Cuba
are making profitable businesses
here in little havana.
As I quickly learned, it's
not as easy as it looks...
What's the story here?
Is it the Cuban, or are you
getting cute with the cigar?
This is tally atwater, channel
9 news, little havana.
The Cuban, of course.
Then you should have found out
that this particular
exiled cigarmaker
is not a cigarmaker
from havana,
but a Batista officer.
Just do it better.
Right.
Harvey's truck is down.
What?
On his way to...
How long would it take us
to get to Miami beach?
I thought we'd be doing
this bullshit boat show
until you detoured
onto Connie's jewelry.
No, no, no. This is a much better story.
How long?
Half an hour.
Vic, uh, yeah, tally.
Listen, ned and I are moments
from this Harvey story.
Yeah...
Harvey's truck is down.
I know it's down.
I'm covering till
he gets here. Ned?
But if he doesn't get here, you'll
need an on-camera reporter.
What? You've never
done a live feed.
You don't even know
what the story is.
Get the boat, get the
cables, get the balconies,
um... Get the spokesman...
Then tell me what the story is.
Ok.
Show me what you got.
Get in there.
Jam the damn Mike in his face.
Wait a minute...
positive I.D. First.
And... and how do you
do that, sheriff?
Metro dade, missy.
I said how do you make
a positive I.D.?
I know she's never
done a live feed, Vic,
but I've done live feeds,
so if she can't cut
it, I'll do it, ok?
We can call this one Juan Doe.
His name is Juan Doe?
Ha ha ha... Ha ha ha...
Or is that your way
of suggesting
that this particular John Doe,
or unidentified person,
is or was Spanish speaking?
Cute, missy.
All right, now, listen,
I'm gonna ask you all just to bear
with us and be patient here...
First thing... stay upwind.
Which way is upwind?
Away form the stink.
Floaters stink because their
stomachs fill with gas.
That's what brings them up.
Sometimes they pop.
We can shoot right here.
But... but they're over there.
Ok. Raul sota, Domingo katz.
Colombians. Deckhands on the<i> s.S.
Bolivar</i>
out of berenchia.
They jumped ship.
I called the harbormaster.
Calling the harbormaster
is what reporters do.
They just don't
show up on the scene.
Raul sota and Domingo katz.
We're still too close.
The storm that slammed
into Miami yesterday...
not yesterday.
Yesterday's history.
News happens today.
Today. Forget yesterday.
Today. Ok.
Show her face in camera...
I think I'm gonna faint.
Where's upwind?
Not where you're at.
Vic, are you with me?
How much time have we got?
Ok.
A minute and 12 seconds
to come up with a lead-in.
Ok. Now, wh-what are you doing?
This isn't about lipstick.
This is about them...
Raul sota, Domingo katz.
2 guys jump ship
for the land of plenty,
and they drown 25 feet
from getting it.
People like Raul sota
and Domingo katz
don't get taught how to swim.
That's what this story's
about, not makeup.
Vic? One minute.
Ok. In the blue water
off Miami today...
Miami beach today.
Raul sota, Domingo katz...
what did they die for,
what did they want?
In the blue water
off Miami beach today,
divers...
hold the divers.
Hold the divers.
Lead with Raul sota
and Domingo katz.
I'll tell you what to say.
I know what to say.
Well, then say it!
Raul sota and Domingo k...
Raul sota and Domingo...
25 feet from the big enchilada.
25 feet from the promised land.
25 feet from walking down
Collins Avenue
and a job bussing dishes
at the blue.
Do you have any idea what it's
like to want something that bad?
Ned: 10 seconds, Warren.
Answer me. Do you?
Yes.
Then show me.
Rob can't stretch.
She's on in 7 seconds...
6...5...
Tell me a story.
4...3...2...
2 men drowned today
off Miami beach.
Raul sota and Domingo katz
did not belong
in the luxurious cabanas
that line this stretch
of the beach.
They jumped ship.
They wanted to come to
America, and they died...
25 feet from what they must
have seen as the promised land.
Were these men seeking
asylum, tally?
Uh, all we know, rob, is that
a pilgrimage to El norte
that began in
berenchia, Colombia,
spelled death today for
Raul sota and Domingo katz.
This is tally atwater
on Miami beach.
Yes!
Girl's got chops.
Thank you.
I was wondering
if you could say that.
That was nice work
on the aliens.
Thanks.
It made me reflect on
how many of them every day
actually get in.
Food for thought.
I've never thought
of it that way, rob.
A little advice from Uncle rob.
Watch Warren.
Don't let him bring
you along too fast.
You feel you need a mentor...
Rob-erino.
Thanks.
Ok.
On tonight's
<i>assignment earth...</i>
Selling dirty air.
<i>Entiende usted...</i>
<i>Entiende...</i>
<i>Me falta practica.</i>
When oriana falacci
interviewed fidel Castro,
she did it in Spanish.
Well, before you set up
your one-on-one with fidel,
you might want to get
a new jacket or two.
We have a consultant that we use...
Inez cifuentes.
Ok.
We have a budget for it.
We don't want the look
to get in the way.
Now, Warren said
to keep a little edge.
Thank you.
It's a "when did you stop
beating your wife" kinda deal.
Diaz isn't going to
admit he's taking money,
so if you can get him not
answering the question on camera,
well, then you've
told the story.
And another thing...
well, that's nice.
Edgy enough for you?
Inez, you can do something
about the hair?
I'm not cutting my hair.
Ned, come on. Get ahead of me.
Sorry. Excuse me.
We'll win, we'll win.
Uh, congressman, how do
you answer allegations
that you profited
from drug money?
That is no longer an issue.
Isn't it true
that your campaign
received sizable contributions
from at least one
foreign-based individual?
Congressman.
Congressman.
Would you like to
take this opportunity
to clear up these allegations?
Just tell him I got the
mother of the sex change boy.
Probably because donahue
was a sex change boy.
Yeah, I know she's
a second-tier.
I also know she's available.
200 years of a free press,
and we're down to the
mother of a sex change boy.
No, there's no point in trying
to get local color here.
Tell him that. Just get me
into havana on Thursday.
3, 2, 1.
Behind those smoke-glass windows
in downtown Miami today...
Bet that one's yours.
You win.
Got it?
Asshole Diaz.
Tally atwater, joanna kennelly.
Joanna's my ex-wife.
Well, one of them.
The one that left me
in Washington
as opposed to the one that
left me in new Orleans.
Joanna's on her way to havana.
Why don't you come with me?
Well, you could think about it.
Do you really expect to get
a statement from Diaz?
Tally, let me show you the
beauty of television news.
I expected to
get him on camera,
and I did.
Of course you did.
Get plenty of
ambient noise, ok?
And balloons.
How would you do it?
Oh, perfectly.
I love balloons.
Here, look at this.
Congressman, congressman.
Watch this.
And you dissolve
from the window...
To you, like this.
Then...
Lay in the sound.
Tape: Behind those smoke-glass
windows in downtown Miami today
is congressman Jorge Diaz,
who was...
So, you and joanna...
Joanna...
Thought I was
a capitol hill insider,
which at the time I was.
We were a cute couple on the
Sunday shows for a while.
But being around
in the morning...
Isn't my long suit.
See, you got your questions,
got your ambient noise
at the rally.
Can't imagine it's
your long suit, either.
Maybe not.
So we keep it loose,
we keep it open,
and if we get lucky...
Gold.
We hear you.
You and joanna have
any children?
No.
Iris and I had...
iris?
Yeah, my first wife.
We had a little girl.
She lived a week, 8 days.
You have family?
Mm-hmm. A sister.
You close?
Mm-hmm. I raised her
after my mother died.
Our mom totaled the car
on mount rose highway.
She always wanted
to sing in a lounge,
but she never did.
She had this whole
Patti page set.
She was ok.
Look...
I've been here before.
So have I.
Newsroom. Justice.
Just a minute.
For you.
For me?
This is tally.
Hi.
I'll call you when I get home.
I need to take a few days off.
Something wrong?
No. Nothing's wrong.
But you have to take
some days off.
It's personal, ok?
It's ok. It's ok.
It's gonna be
all right, luanne.
I'll get the money. I'm here.
It's not about economic chaos
or political uncertainty.
Tonight at 6:00, the
channel 9 news team...
About that omega-7 story...
yeah. Did it make a
seventh parole hearing?
Let Steve do it.
And if tally's back
tomorrow afternoon,
she can do an action wrap-up.
I wouldn't count on that.
You want me to get accounting
to wire her the cash advance?
No.
I'll take care of it.
Tell Dan I hear Arnie poole's
contract's up in San Francisco,
and I just might get him
a new weatherman.
1, 20, 40, 60, 80, 2...
75.
It's not my problem if her
boyfriend skips out on her
and steals her money.
I want the rent n-o-w, now.
I'll get it to you tomorrow.
I mean in full.
I told her that or else I
gotta get the marshal in.
I'll get the rest
of it tomorrow.
Tomorrow's today. Pay
up or out luanne goes.
How much?
Huh?
What are you doing here?
I'm on my way to San Francisco
to buy Dan some happy weather.
How much?
She's 550 short.
Extra goes on account.
Let's go.
Did you interview you
any celebrities?
Come on.
You still get a rush
out of humiliating me.
I didn't come here for a rush.
Oh, then what did
you come here for?
I had a hunch. You had a hunch?
You had a hunch
you could walk in here
and get the story
on me and my sister.
I have no interest in your sister.
I don't even know your sister.
I just met her
a few minutes ago.
Why don't you get her in depth
washing her underwear
in the bathroom sink
next to the chemical toilet?
Look, you asked for cash.
I provided it.
Over and out.
You provided it?
What exactly do you
take me for?
No, wait a minute.
You come here
and you spread bills around
like you picked me up in
some bar off fremont street
in front of that asshole!
You have no business here.
Hold a minute. Hold on.
You work for me.
You announce you're taking off.
You forget about the
part if it's ok with me.
You shoot off a fax
demanding cash.
I'm not allowed to wonder why?
And you figured you'd
do me this big favor
and I'd owe you.
Well, that was my mistake.
Every girl I grew up with
ended up thinking
she owed some guy.
This doesn't interest me.
I was gonna get us out of here.
I remember telling luanne
we'll get an apartment
on the upper West Side
because I read in some magazine
that said Diane Sawyer
lived there.
I didn't know the upper
West Side of what.
I just knew I had
to get us there.
That's what happens.
Some guy comes along and...
No more upper West Side.
Does that interest you?
That interests me.
I need another couple of days
to make sure she's all right.
If that's ok with you.
It's perfectly ok with me.
Attention, passengers,
this is the final boarding call
for flight 804
to San Francisco.
All remaining passengers
should board now.
So take as long as you need.
I didn't want you
to see any of this.
So what?
Warren, on video: We've
completely ignored the fact
that this is a society
divided by fear, hatred,
and violence.
Not true.
We haven't discussed...
"promises and pie crusts
are made to be broken,."
Jonathan swift once said.
And the president's
environmental package today
resembled so much
cherry pie crust.
A South vietnamese plane struck
the wrong target here today...
their own village.
Napalm burned a group
of civilians
running for their lives.
Here is what we do not know
on this day where over 200
U.S. marines were killed
with the death toll
still rising.
We do not know why there was
no perimeter defense set up
that might have stopped
the suicide bomber.
We do not know what role
these marines were
supposed to play
in this war-ravaged city.
We do not know why
they were even here.
And so at the end
of this terrible day,
what we do know is that
over 200 marines died
without knowing why.
This is Warren justice,
ibs news, beirut, Lebanon.
Reporter: Warren justice
stepped down today
as chief white house
correspondent for ibs.
An award-winning journalist,
justice has been a prominent
figure at ibs...
Tally: So, what is it like
working at the network?
Warren: You think
you get to the network
and look back at everybody
that made you eat it
and say, "up yours,"
but it's not like that.
What is it like?
It's hard.
Fun.
Why did you leave?
It stopped being fun.
Tell me about these
dumb contests
you used to enter
with, uh, tawny.
Tawny button.
Why don't you tell me why
it stopped being fun.
You like a contest?
The contest.
Contest.
Miss state line, miss truckee,
miss Tahoe, miss Sierra logger.
Ooh.
I'll tell you a secret.
I'd keep Sierra logger
a secret.
No. The secret is
in not one of them
did I finish in the top 5.
So what'd you do for talent?
Did you by any chance
sing<i> feelings?</i>
No. For your information,
I did not by any chance
sing<i> feelings.</i>

phone sex is on the rise.
Yeah, let<i> hard copy</i> do it.
Warren won't touch that.
Alaskan wolves.
As in the slaughter of?
We have tape of a wolf
caught in a trap.
You got tape on that? Yes.
Run it at 6:00.
Well, Metro-dade reports
tourists robbery
complaints are up 8%.
It's not a story this town's
talking about.
Dan and I were...
correction.
It's not a story this
town wants to talk about.
I don't think tally has her pulse
on the finger of the community
the way I do, Warren.
I think you mean
finger on the pulse
of the community, rob.
Anyway... Uh, let's get
people talking about it.
Harvey, why don't you
get into that?
Look at it as your first step
towards the peabody award.
Somebody gonna make me happy?
Oh, wait, wait.
Here's a cross-dresser
from Tallahassee
who gets all the way
to the finals
in the miss Florida contest.
Rob: Boring.
Tally, maybe you want
to handle that.
Oh, no.
No, I have a hunch you...
you could do a real
in-depth piece on it.
I think I'll pass.
But think of it, a
cross-dresser from Tallahassee
who ¶ dreams
the impossible dream ¶
you cannot be trusted.
Ok...
Anything else?
So, this is where I live.
It's... what?
Police dispatch radio:
Possible 502.
Vehicle registered
to skylight limo.
Do you keep this on
all the time?
I find it soothing.
The sound of human iniquity.
Know what a 502 is?
D.W.I. Driving
while intoxicated.
Skylight limo's the one
the rockers use.
Probably a drug bust.
Controlled substances.
Tally atwater reporting live.
You better get going.
The night we did the Diaz story
in the editing room...
I didn't know you then.
I'm not gonna be the guy
that goes...
No more upper West Side.
So how 'bout it?
First on the scene,
one-on-one with
the lead guitar?
It's what you want, isn't it?
What do you want?
Eh.
I knew you'd go.
Tally atwater saying
happy new year
from wmia channel 9,
news heartbeat of
the American riviera.
You give us 30 minutes,
and we give you Miami,
<i>y El mundo.</i>
TV reporter: We're back
in Times Square...
Have you ever met
bucky terranova?
Uh-uh.
Agents are for babes, tal,
not for grunts.
He's coming to Miami
next week for a panel.
So is joanna kennelly.
You know, you and Warren...
You guys aren't having a...
You know... Thing, are you?
No.
That's what I thought.
Uh, the usual deal is
somebody ends up crying.
Nobody's going
to end up crying.
And it's usually not Warren.
Happy new year to all of you.
Ok, did you got the baby?
Ok, now... now, you get me, ok?
Ok.
Fernando, you were
convicted in July
of armed robbery,
your third felony conviction.
No. Uh, 4.
Mm-hmm.
So, you get free baby clothes,
toys, diaper service
for a year,
all for... what are you
calling the baby?
Fernandito.
I always really wanted
to name him.
Fernando after me.
<i>Lo felicito por su</i>
<i>hermoso bebe.</i>
<i>Gracias.</i>
And so Fernando buttanda
heads north
to holmsberg prison,
leaving behind his wife Augustina
and their 5 children...
Here's something
from the booth.
And rosalio bota,
who at 12:02 this morning
gave birth to his son
Fernando Jr.,
Miami's first baby
of the new year.
Sad story, tally.
It is, rob.
One with a new year's twist.
I was just informed
that the local
merchant's association
decided that because of the
unusual circumstances,
the firstborn layette
should be awarded instead
to little Tiffany polachek.
Born 12:59 A.M.
at kaiser hospital...
You might have cleared
this with me.
Director: Back to
the 2-shot. Take.
Tiffany was
the second born, rob.
The layette was supposed
to go to the first.
I think I see
the merchants' point.
Warren: Uh-oh.
Arguing on the air.
I'm not surprised you do, rob.
Happy new year.
Go to commercial.
Uh, no go. 30 seconds
till the credits.
After all, Mr. Buttanda
is an habitual offender,
and the woman has had 2 other
children out of wedlock.
After all what, rob?
Guys, cut it out.
I don't think we need
to go into that, tally.
You got 2 cameras on them.
Get one on something else.
What else is there.
It's a runaway train.
Rob, in the spirit
of the new year
and the whole idea
of firstborn,
I'm sure wmia
would be delighted
to honor Miami's
true firstborn,
fernandito buttanda.
She can't do that.
She just did it.
15 seconds to credits.
That's all for tonight.
I'm rob Sullivan.
Tally will surely
join me in saying
be of good cheer
and happy new year,
from all of us at
the channel 9 news team.
Go. Add it.
Well, that tears it.
All right, we gotta
hold this for 15.
Kill their Mikes.
This is the last time
you sit here.
I didn't know you'd been appointed
commissar of public morality.
He's a criminal,
and she's a whore.
If you can't understand that.
Only whores have babies
out of wedlock?
Warren, your protégée
is out of line.
Protégée. Does
that mean whore, too?
Tally, shut up and smile.
Rob, we're still on air.
Keep smiling.
Warren, we've got to talk.
You saw tonight.
She doesn't have the maturity.
You're pushing her too fast.
Your protégée doesn't
have the maturity.
Is that what you mean?
If you think that pompadour
gives you maturity,
you need professional
help, rob.
That's enough, tally.
Rob, handling the unexpected
is what we call television.
She has no right...
to what, tell the truth
or change copy
to something safe?
Warren, you know
as well as I do
she's off the reservation.
And it's up to you to...
to what, rope her in? Cut
her down to size, Dan?
What size do you
want her? Your size?
Warren, I'm warning you.
Director: That's a wrap.
Thank you.
That's unbelievable.
Unbelievable!
Rob: I've never seen such
childlike, amateurish behavior.
They would have fired her
when I was in St. Louis.
Right, rob.
Tough shop, St. Louis.
I'm taking this to Dan.
If you don't, I will.
Listen...
Next time you want to
embarrass the station,
quit first.
You want me to quit?
Yeah, that's what I want.
You'd better get it
through your head,
you don't go around changing
station policy on air!
I'm the one that has
to get it through my head?!
This is a team!
But I'm not part
of the team, am I?
Because no matter what I do,
I will always be written off
as the news director's
protégée!
So, fine!
I am perfectly capable
of finding a job
where I am nobody's protégée.
<i>Feliz año nuevo.</i>
You're right.
My sister has a baby.
Her live-in has a record.
That make her a whore?
Right again.
He's just stupid.
He's an anchor.
Reporter: Mr. Terranova,
Mr. Terranova.
Photographer: Mr. Terranova,
one photo, please.
Reporter: Uh, joanna kennelly.
Mr. Terranova.
Tally.
Bucky, one last shot.
Joanna kennelly.
We've met before.
Yes. Hello.
Excuse me, miss kennelly
sure.
This way, Mr. Terranova.
Have you known bucky for long?
Oh, no, I don't
actually know him.
But you want to.
Bucky, come here.
Excuse me.
Very good.
Tally atwater,
Mr. Bucky terranova.
News heartbeat of
the American riviera,
you give us 30 minutes,
we'll give you<i> El mundo?</i>
I was wondering when
you'd walk into my life.
Please.
Joanna: I'm gonna need
a suite at the Wilshire
and a floor pass at the forum.
It hasn't got to do with that.
Just tell him it's for the day
that the Lakers play
the Phoenix, um...
What... what are they...
suns.
Suns. No, I'll call you back.
Sex and drugs, the downside of
basketball's instant millionaires.
A joanna kennelly
in-depth report.
Well, those tall millionaires
in shorts will love you.
You still got a nice ass.
But it's not
this year's ass, is it?
Not even last year's.
I am 7 years and
3 dozen asses back.
The next time I see you...
It'll be 4 dozen.
Unless you're gonna tell me
this one's different.
Wait a minute...
Has somebody
finally got to you?
This is not what you think.
Just good friends.
That is novel.
What's it feel like?
It feels... Good.
You gonna go with her
when she makes her move?
You need a year or two
in a major market.
Preferably at an o-and-o.
Heavy face time.
What's your feeling
about Philadelphia?
What?
A large city in Pennsylvania.
I can put you there.
It's the number 4 market.
It's doable.
They're looking
for a fresh face.
Lucky timing.
Your voice is full of money.
Anybody ever tell you that?
Ah.
I was having...
I know where you were,
and I know where you're going.
I'll bet he said your
voice was full of money.
It's what he always says.
He's famous for it. He
even said it to joanna.
You know, it's actually
not even his line.
It's from a novel.
"Her voice was full of money.
"That was
the inexhaustible charm
that rose and fell on it."
Hemingway, right?
F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Cheap shot.
It's the right move.
Nobody ever called bucky dumb.
I guess it's even
the right time.
We had some fun, you and I.
Didn't we?
What is it you want?
Hmm?
You know what I want.
You want to go to Philadelphia.
No.
So, he says to me,
"if you need a mentor...
Rober-ito.
Rober-ito?
Rober-ito.
Oh! Will you do me a favor?
Rober-ito, but he was serious.
Don't ever say that again.
You could come with me.
First prize,
a week in Philadelphia.
Second prize...
2 weeks in Philadelphia.
It's an old joke.
I've already been
where you're going.
You could go back.
No.
Why not?
I already told you.
Yeah, all you told me is
that it stopped being fun.
It was a good run
while it lasted.
Then I made a mistake.
What kind of mistake?
I had a source, and
I trusted the source,
and I went with the
story, and I got burned.
The source did what sources do.
I should have picked up the
signals, and I missed them.
You're allowed to make
a mistake once in a while.
Not really.
If you choose
not to play on the team,
you can't afford mistakes.
Why didn't we do this before?
Because it was always going
to be this hard to stop.
You know, we have
some time before you go.
I don't want to go.
Sure, you do.

female anchor: Up next,
shocking new information
about a nursing home
sex scandal.
Stay with us.
We'll be back in a moment.
John...
Whoever wrote that copy about the
nursing home should be fired.
It's silly, it's wrong,
and I won't say it.
Well, then wing it, marcia,
you're up to speed
on the story.
Real war horse, marcia.
I thought we'd get together
for a drink after the show
so you two kids could
get to know each other.
John.
Would you mind
having your guest move?
She's in my eye line.
I'm sorry.
Oh, here we go again.
John, have you any idea
how little coverage
we actually devote
to substantive discussion
of public policy?
You, uh, you an issues
wonk, too, tally?
Uh, I agree,
it's an important point.
What is?
The need for substenant, uh...
Um... Uh... Bucky told me...
bucky? Bucky who?
Bucky terranova,
my agent, uh...
Said that tom orr
told him that...
tom?
You know tom?
Well, not exactly,
but according to bucky...
oh, well, tom is just about
the worst offender.
Well, I have 2 charity
auctions to attend tonight.
That actually
a banana daiquiri?
Yeah.
Spring break, lauderdale.
Good night, tally.
Good night.
Ready, v.T. One...
Time again for 90 years young.
Today we're blessed with twins.
Go, v.T. One.
It's a cute segment.
What's cute about it, Dan?
Reporter: To the active things
they did in their younger days.
These lovely ladies
grew up in the mountains...
You think it's cute to be
condescending to people
just because they happen
to be older than you?
You gonna think it's cute
when you're 98,
fighting to hang onto
your dignity,
and there's rob Sullivan
out of the blue
with some cheap birthday cake
calling you
a beautiful youngster?
I don't want to argue
about this, Warren.
There are people fighting
out there for this spot.
And any time I have a spot
that advertisers
are willing to fight for,
then,<i> no problema.</i>
This is a good spot.
Oh, is that what we're doing?
Is that how we're programming
evening news now, Dan?
Asking the advertisers
what they want?
Say an advertiser wants a laugh
track on the evening local,
what about that, Dan?
<i>No problema?</i>
Like it or not, Warren,
this is a business.
Yeah, it's a business.
The entertainment business.
The hell with the news.
The hell with the truth.
Ahh.
Where have all
the good times gone?
Philadelphia.
Off this
ambulance driver's strike,
we could get into the whole
crisis in emergency care.
Emergency rooms are so crowded,
hospitals are turning
ambulances away.
They don't have the beds.
What hospitals, tally?
County general, for one.
Queen of angels? St. Matthew's?
How many hospitals?
Tal, you said "hospitals,"
plural.
Which hospitals? When?
How many people
turned away? Why?
I, uh, I have a call in
to the, uh, the, uh...
Paramedics association.
Well, when you have
the statistics,
I think you should
definitely reintroduce it.
Ok.
Shall we move on?
If you could find him, ileana,
I only have a minute. Thanks.
Warren!
So, I saw on the weather
channel it's 95 down there.
Actually, I... I just
didn't want to forget
what your voice sounded like.
No, I haven't forgotten
what you look like.
Stop right there.
We have to feed.
I miss you, too.
Rape has become an ugly fact
of life in Philadelphia,
and in just a moment,
we'll be hearing from tally
atwater on that subject.
Some statistics may
convey the idea, marcia.
According to recent studies,
the median age of men who commit
rape in Philadelphia is 23.
Half have
a prior arrest record.
9% of these have been
previously arrested for rape.
Sobering, but don't
you think, tally,
that statistics can seem,
in the face of real
human outrage,
worse than irrelevant?
Right, marcia.
Coming up next,
Bernie platt with the weather.
Ahem.
You want some
coffee or something?
Well, uh, I thought
I owed you a talk.
We've got these marketing
consultants upstairs.
They run focus groups, uh...
You know, say they invite 20
citizens in for cold cuts,
see what they like
and don't like.
And I thought it might
be constructive
if we had a look-see
at what they had to say
about tally atwater.
Oh, very helpful, John.
I don't like her.
I hit the refrigerator
when she comes on.
You know, she looks like, uh...
A bush-league marcia.
If you ask me, it's her hair.
Why is it women always
go with the hair?
Hair is character.
Oh, nobody from nowhere.
Well, that's enough of that.
Tally, I hired you.
I still think
you have real potential,
but there's a feeling
that you're not...
Making...
Contact.
Right.
Yeah.
Well said.
But I want to leave this
on a positive note.
I think what you ought to do
is talk to the consultants
who run these deals
and just see what
they have to say, ok?
Ok.
Great.
Warren: Something up?
Anything wrong?
No, no reason at all.
I just, uh, I mean, uh...
I mean, why should
anything be wrong?
I just happen to be so busy,
and I just hit a break.
So, been busy?
You need a break?
Well, I saw
these consultants...
consultants on what?
Um, I... I had a makeover.
A makeover? What
do you mean, a makeover?
Um, it seems that I was
a little too edgy for Philly,
but, uh, marcia
couldn't be nicer.
She's a... Super girl.
Super?
Marcia mcgrath?
Tal, you ok? Anything I can do?
No, everything's great.
Um, it's just that I...
It's just that I...
I, uh...
Wanted to say hi.
Hi.
Hi.
You want to say
hi again, I'm here.
Bye.
<i>Hablo inglés?</i>
Bucky terranova.
So, Warren, how long's it been?
R.F.K. Stadium. Owners' box.
Redskins, giants.
I wanted to leave Washington.
You said you didn't handle
people on the way down.
Redskins won.
So what brings you to Miami?
Stone crab?
Try again.
Well, the fact is, Warren,
I have a client in a certain
amount of distress.
A client with whom you have
a special relationship.
It occurred to me, you
might want to be up there
for a period of time.
Last I heard,
I still had a job here.
Oh, yes, and I see that
it keeps you very busy.
What if I can arrange a leave?
Wait a minute.
I'm seeing daylight
out of this.
I bring Mel Casey down from
Atlanta to sub for you.
He's got a young wife,
and he wants the spot jobs.
Meshugena. But it's his life.
You already laid this
on Dan, haven't you?
You, too,
could use the time off.
Hmm.
This isn't about you and me.
She's in trouble.
Think it over.
What's up?
I was just wishing I was driving
down the keys with you,
and we were already picking
up havana on the radio.
How long can you stay?
Long enough.
Oh, hey, what the...
Oh.
John. Long time no see.
Warren.
John and I covered
the d.E.A. Together
in new Orleans.
Just... Left
my appointment book here,
and I'm on my way.
I didn't think
you were coming back.
I think he figured
that out, tal.
Tally. Warren.
Fabian, here you are,
back home in the town
where you were discovered
on your own front steps
when you were only 14...
Everybody loved that piece.
We got a huge response.
How do you justify...
I mean... Considering.
What about that guy
who chose to murder
that... that... that woman?
That was a terrific idea.
It just wasn't...
contemporary music today...
It wasn't... Quite... Executed.
You and your children
have been here
for 7 weeks now.
Well... When...
Yeah. I was, uh...
I was really off that day,
but there is some good stuff
with her children...
The, uh... S.R.O.
Housing corporation
of course, being the city
agency responsible...
no, no. You didn't get to the
stuff with the children.
I don't need to.
No, but it's good.
It's shit.
It was what?
It was all shit.
Why was she in the hospital?
The social worker told her
she couldn't get her
kids back unless what?
Did you listen to one word
that woman was saying,
or were you too busy worrying
about impressing the viewers
with how much policy
jargon you could spout?
Come here.
Who is that?
Who the hell is this?
What the hell happened to you?
Where's tally atwater?
You tell me. You should know.
You invented her!
Well, I did one lousy job.
You come up here,
you take one look
at marcia mcgrath's
uptown eastern act,
and you fold.
If I was into inventing
people, believe me,
I would have invented somebody
a hell of a lot tougher
than you turned out to be.
I am exactly
the way you made me.
Do it<i> this</i> way! Do it
<i>that</i> way, do it<i> my</i> way,
until I don't even know
how to do it without you!
Bullshit! I dressed you, I
pointed you toward the camera,
but<i> you</i> did it.
You told the story, and
you know how to do it,
and you're going to start
doing it on your own.
I can't.
Look at this, because when
you get to the network...
don't even talk to me about...
I said when you
get to the network,
20 million people are going
to be depending on you...
I don't care.
You goddamn well will care
because before they trust you,
they have to know you're
listening to them.
And you can't listen to them
unless you damn well know
who you are.
You see?
It's not all marcia
mcgrath country up here,
so give them tally atwater.
When I asked you
how long you could stay
and you said long enough...
How long is that?
When we're not together...
everything shuts down.
As councilman
for this district,
you were influential in securing
the permits and waivers
that allowed patriot hill
to begin construction.
Yes, yes. I cut through some of
the red tape for the developers.
Uh-huh. That was me.
When patriot hill
was still called dog bottom,
these same developers
bought up the neighborhood
for dog bottom prices.
Well, they also
are in business.
<i>Big</i> business, from
what I understand.
Anchorman: Evacuations
continue at the holly ball,
the scene of
the suspicious fire.
Tally, what's the latest?
Whether the chandelier
went down
before or after 911 got called,
nobody is saying.
But this has to be one of
the most incendiary affairs
of what social register types
here call "the season."
Well, tally, the holly ball
is one of our prettiest
and most traditional events.
How do you suppose
such a thing happened?
Uh... Just kids
with too much time
and nothing to do
with it, marcia.
Bored silly
and dressed to kill.
Is that your opinion, tally?
No, marcia.
That is observable fact.
Thank you, tally.
Bucky...
Marcia: John, can I talk
to you a minute, please?
Right. She is looking good.
Uh, I'd like to
sit down with you
sometime this week.
So, the ratings are up,
the research says it's tally.
I owe you one.
I hadn't thought
that she was going
to need her hand held.
Bucky, you make your
living off of people
that need their hands held.
She can go all the
way, can't she?
Assuming she
doesn't go wiggy again.
Mmm.
Does a first-rate job,
makes a few breaks
for herself...
lbs is the shot.
Very fluid lineup.
Plus Wendy chan shows more
than she's been showing.
How long?
A year, 2 years, 18 months.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Time out to decode.
You up for the duration?
No comment, read yes.
Miami know this?
Dan and I don't put each
other on speed dial.
Yeah, if Dan hears you're
even thinking about it,
you've seen your last
moon over Miami.
From the point of view of the
guys who do the hiring, Warren,
you don't exactly
read user-friendly.
You left too much scorched
earth on the last pass.
What is this, bucky?
Tough love?
Try Pete Raymond.
Last time I saw Pete Raymond,
I told him the only story
I'd be interested in
watching him cover
was his own retirement.
Funny. That's funny.
But you see the problem.
I got it.
Incidentally, I didn't
mention to tally
I was seeing you tonight.
Still doing it your way, I see.
You got leverage
now. Tell merino
if he wants to keep her happy,
there's a cameraman in Miami.
He's a good man.
Man: Hey, tally.
Ned!
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Oh, Warren pulled
a few strings.
Really?
It's me.
Hell of a temptation, Warren,
having you back on the market.
Never thought
you'd leave Miami.
But, end of the day,
you're a hard-news guy.
We recently did
a 5-parter on nannies.
5-parter on nannies.
Right off the charts,
response-wise.
Is that right?
Ok.
You don't do nannies.
You don't take prisoners.
You ought to pitch somebody
you don't have a history with.
There's a hot young kid
at 4 in Baltimore.
Cord otavio.
Hold all my calls.
So...
Tell me something
about yourself, uh...
"Warren."
You first...
"Cord."
Talked to bucky today,
mentioned your being here.
He already knew it.
Asked how you were.
So, how are you?
I never thought
a partial eclipse
would get to be
my idea of a good time.
You know what I wish?
That this eclipse
would move faster.
I wish you didn't
have to go back to Miami.
It's Warren justice
calling for Pete Raymond again.
No, no, not Mr. Warren.
Mr. Justice.
Look at it this way. If, uh,
Mr. Raymond doesn't know who I am,
he doesn't have
to call me back.
¶ All right ¶
¶ under the blue heaven
mornin' here ¶
¶ at radio rockin' sockin'
Philadelphia ¶
¶ channel 7,
have you checked it out? ¶
¶ they got the babe
that makes me shout ¶
¶ talkin' 'bout marcia
I am not ¶
¶ ooh, tally, what you got... ¶
¶ you better believe it... ¶
Marcia, you may be
overreacting.
She takes my broadcast,
a broadcast
with which I am identified
and for which I am responsible,
and she makes my broadcast,
and by extension, me,
the object of vulgar innuendo.
The object is not you.
It's me.
If you want to talk
about the d.J., nobody...
just forget about the d.J.
We've got an election
coming up here.
I'd hate to waste marcia.
She knows more about state
politics than the pols do,
so I offer her senior
political correspondent
and director of campaign
coverage, I don't know,
whatever the hell title
she wanted,
and she, um...
Well, passed.
I want you to take over
some of her duties.
Is that what this is all about?
Yeah.
Is she staying?
She has an offer in Cincinnati.
Anchor.
It's a nice market for her.
You don't use 20?
My red 28. You should use 29.
This and a quick comb-out
and I'm ready to go on air
tomorrow night in Cincinnati.
<i>Quelle</i> irony.
I was offered a job
at wmia this week.
Hmm? Yeah. Chris rice wanted me
to come in and coanchor
with rob Sullivan.
Chris rice?
Yeah, Chris rice of Chicago.
Dynamite news guy.
What's he doing at Mia?
Ha! Getting along with Dan,
which is more than Warren
ever bothered to do.
Well, I'm reasonable.
A chiquita banana
for me, but...
Chris is really shaking
things up down there.
I actually considered
blowing off Cincinnati,
streaking my hair, and...
Going down to work with Chris,
but you get to be 42,
you know what it costs
to jump off the high board.
You didn't know it was
Chris who replaced Warren?
What does it take
to jump off the high board?
You get to be 42,
you don't have to ask.
It's not your fault.
You know that.
It's not anybody's fault.
This is the way it works.
Actually...
I'm 44.
Not even bucky knows that.
Warren: It's been
a while, buford.
Good times.
Good times.
You're looking
for a job, aren't you?
Shit, Warren, you got a habit
of calling a horse's ass
a horse's ass.
We got some folks
around that shop
just don't appreciate that.
You mean like Gabe Lawrence,
vice president of infotainment?
Yeah. What was it you said
about Gabe's Grenada coverage?
Blood, sweat, and Perrier.
Ha ha!
He never even made
the invasion.
It coincided with an unbreakable
periodontal appointment.
The flossers are
in charge now, Warren.
I'm just a noble fucking savage
they trot out to
the affiliate meetings.
Are your sources at the
Pentagon still good?
I think so. Why?
You might want to ask them
about South of here.
Yeah?
1999, we got to give
back the Panama canal,
and I just can't
see that happening
without a whole bunch of people
running a whole lot of blades.
This intuition, or
you hear something?
I heard the usual people
were interested.
You got anybody on it?
Ol' Gabe don't think
there's a story.
You go down there,
you'd own it.
Kind of wanted to stay
around here for a while.
Is she worth it?
Deep down, she wants
to shoot up the town.
Oh, hell, I'm
always good for lunch.
Aw, you've heard
all my stories, buford.
Take care of yourself.
You, too.
Hey.
I've been trying
to call you all day.
I should've let you know.
I went up to New York.
To do what?
Nothing much. You
should've been up there.
There's a street fair
on one of these
incredible New York days.
See anybody you know?
All these little kids
running around
with cotton candy
on their face.
What?
Anything happen up there?
Yeah. Yeah.
Here's a news break.
I got a cabdriver that
could find penn station...
oh, whoa, whoa,
wait a second now.
What?
Is there something you
don't want to tell me?
You ask a lot of questions.
I don't get a lot of answers.
A lot of reporters think
their job in Washington
is to cover their bets.
Warren didn't.
He thought he was there
to tell the story,
which didn't make him
widely popular.
He ever tell you why
he left the network?
He said he... Made a
mistake on a story.
He trusted the source,
and he shouldn't have.
That's what he told me.
He trusted the source
because I was the source.
I took a year off
from the Washington bureau
to run briefings for state.
Warren and I had a deal.
I did what I had to do,
he did what he had to do.
Never dreamed for a minute
he'd buy that story.
But he did.
Yeah, he did.
In the overall scheme
of things,
it shouldn't have mattered,
but it did matter,
because the network
was looking for an excuse,
and now they had an excuse.
They saw him as a wild
card to begin with.
They got him to sit down at
lunch at 21 with buford sells.
Buford sells put it to him,
play it the network's way
or take the highway,
and our Warren
took the highway.
Buford used to be
his best friend.
So, you see,
it took a lot for him
to ask bu for a job.
You do a lot of things
for a lot of people.
There can't be many people
in this business
who don't owe you a favor.
Now you're going
to collect one.
You're going to
collect it for me.
Oh, what am I doing?
You did this to me, terranova!
Put my back against the wall,
tell me I got
to hire these guys.
I don't have to
hire these guys!
I already worked
with Warren justice.
He worked down in new
Orleans with the d.E.A.
Almost got me killed...
not now!
Uh, whatever's good
for the governor,
I'll, uh, make
myself available.
We do a series of backgrounders
on the news before
it becomes news.
We start with the governor
hanging his re-election
campaign on prison reform.
McBride's up 24
points in the polls
because the public thinks
cutting inmate privileges
is the tough way to go.
We ask the questions.
"We"?
You and me.
Hmm.
Look, it's "we," why don't
you ask me how I saw it?
How do you see it?
See what the prison
professionals think,
you talk to the warden,
you talk to the guards.
McBride thinks
he's being tough,
my bet is
he's just being butch.
Then you'll do it?
We could see each
other all day long...
God, you want something,
you don't give up.
There's something else I want.
You've already got me doing
one thing I don't want.
What other things
you got in mind?
Marry me.
What?
Marry me.
I've been married.
Twice. Bad idea.
Twice.
I want you around
in the morning.
You already have me
around in the morning.
How, I don't know, but you do.
I want to know you're legally
required to be there.
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you
man and wife.
You may kiss your bride.
Thanks.
Going into some office
and getting the rotary lunch
speech from the warden
won't do it.
But if we could show
how McBride's reforms
are affecting just one
inmate in one prison,
a day in the life...
That would tell the story.
You listening to me or not?
I thought this was supposed
to be our night off.
My wife the candy ass.
Does our night off
end at midnight?
Remember Fernando buttanda?
What?
The father of
the new year's baby.
Miami. Layette.
Rob and I fighting on the air?
Hey... They sent him up here.
Mm-hmm.
From holmsberg.
He's the day in the life.
Full-screen headline... "governor
signs prison reform act."
Cut to McBride. Smash
into his campaign bites.
"Holmsberg is a prison.
It's not a resort.
Holmsberg works," etcetera,
etcetera, etcetera.
Meantime, over each bite,
we show the jump that
he gets in the polls.
And then we have
this one prisoner...
And the effect on him
when McBride orders all
the TV sets and laptops
taken out of each cell.
And also defunded all rehab
and vocational training.
What else?
What do you mean, "what else"?
Well, I just get the sense
you may be coming down
heavy on McBride.
If you think it's heavy to say
that McBride has
been peddling nitro
to get himself re-elected,
then we're coming down heavy.
Look... Do I think
the crime issue
is manipulated
for political ends?
Absolutely.
Then what are we talking about?
Do I think that
large numbers of people
want to hear this?
Not necessarily.
Um... John's concern is...
I know what John's concern is.
Um... John's feeling is that...
He wants us to tell the viewers
what<i> he</i> thinks
they want to hear.
Did you ever entertain any idea
you didn't get from
a focus group, John?
Oh, shit. You know, Warren,
you stake out
the moral high ground,
everybody else gets
altitude sickness.
John...
You think I want
this kind of shit,
think I even wanted
this project?
John!
<i>She</i> wanted it.
You know, you talk
about what you want,
she's the one who's out
there on the line,
and the only reason
she's out there
is to give you something to do!
Actually, I've got
something to do.
Ned: Look, tally,
he'll show up...
You move down...
It's a great story...
He's a professional.
Fine stuff like that.
Let's go in and set up.
Warren justice
for colonel Peters.
Barry?
Are you...
Long time, right.
Barry, you still covering
Panama for the Pentagon?
<i>Oyeme...</i>
I was working in the
infirmary all day
with, uh... I don't
know, how do you say...
<i>Los locos?</i>
The disturbed.
And... I like it,
and they go and Chuck
out the program...
And when they
shut down this gym,
like they say they will do...
Put your hands down!
Everybody in here, man,
is going to be a...
A<i> loco...</i>
Disturbed.
Actually, I'll be
in Washington later today.
Maybe we could just...
Huh?
No, no, maybe we could just
sit down, chew the fat.
About this and that.
Specifically?
I'll call you when I get there.
If you need anything more,
this TV is light
duty, so call me.
Thank you so much.
Ok, thank you.
You get over there!
Don't go out!
Radio: All units, especially
those in the vicinity
of holmsberg prison,
the prisoners have taken control of
the gymnasium and 2 cell blocks.
Unconfirmed,
they're holding
10 to 12 hostages.
A crew from channel 7
apparently had been filming
when the riot broke out.
Hey!
I got guards in there.
You tell the public,
they're dead.
I'm telling you, stop
chickenshitting around and go in.
The warden's got...
governor's got...
what's the governor
got to do with it?
The mayor and
the commissioner...
get the commissioner
on the phone!
Anything on the
channel 7 news crew?
Gary Logan, ibs.
The warden's going
to be briefing me.
Warden keele?
Yes.
Warden...
Warden, I have information there's
a channel 7 reporter still inside.
Can you confirm whether
or not she's alive?
We won't know until we go in.
I'm getting something
on the line.
It may be tally trying to feed.
Tech: Is ned shooting this?
Somebody is. Roll a
production tape.
Tal?
Are you there?
Tal?
Tal, it's me. Are you there?
Are you hearing me?
Tal, can you hear me?
I hear you!
Stay against the wall.
Watch your back.
Ok, you've got one
thing going for you.
You've got the camera.
Whatever you do, do it on-air.
It's the only weapon
you've got.
You're their chance
to tell the world
what's going on in there.
Use the camera.
I'm not on-air!
They don't know that, and
before they do, you will be.
Keep it out there. It's
gonna protect you.
Keep it in his face.
Or you got something to say?
Huh? Huh? 4, 3, 2, 1...
Holmsberg prison!
This is tally atwater, live from
the gymnasium at holmsberg...
Man, just tape it. It's
not gonna be perfect.
Yeah, yeah! First of all,
we demand all our TV back!
We're feeding. They can see us.
We're now feeding live.
We'll try now to go
to tally atwater
for a channel 7 exclusive report.
Tally?
This is tally atwater reporting live...
In holmsberg prison.
At approximately
4:15 this afternoon,
the whistle sounded...
That, all across this country,
means "guard in trouble."
Tally, can you tell us what
precipitated this incident?
Tech: Ok, Warren,
coming back in 30.
Tal, in 30 seconds,
you're back on-air.
There's something
happening in "c" block.
We're gonna try and get closer
after this next feed.
How you doing?
I'm so tired.
You know what I
keep thinking about?
That time you tried to teach me
to bone fish in the keys.
I was really terrible,
wasn't I?
Eh, you were ok.
10 seconds.
Tal, the tac teams are here.
They're taking up positions.
Rhonda:...Back
to the studio. Doug?
Doug: Thank you, Rhonda. As you
know, channel 7's tally atwater
and cameraman ned Jackson
remain inside holmsberg,
where they have
been reporting...
Merino.
The channel 7 news team
was inside the prison,
interviewing inmates for a special
report, when the riot broke out.
The network wants
to go live, national.
It's your show.
Let's try to go live once
again to tally atwater.
Tally, what can you tell us?
We have been told that
tactical assault teams
are taking up positions
outside even as I speak.
Should there be
an onslaught, prisoners...
Tal? Tal, can you hear me?
Goddamn it!
What's going on?
Signal's gone.
Oh, come on.
Doug: Warren? Warren,
what's happening?
Tal, are you there?
Do you hear me? Tal?
Tech: They're gone.
Can't raise them at all.
We're right here in front
of holmsberg prison
where the s.W.A.T.
Team has come in...
Philadelphia, hang on.
New York, yeah, what?
No, not yet. No. I don't
have audio, either.
Stand by. When we do, we'll
let you know. Stand by.
Tom... look, if we get it,
when we get it,
we're gonna go national.
That's right.
Tom orr: ...Civil
rights attorney
and prisoner advocate,
Gary mandanak.
Gentlemen, thank you for joining
us at this very late hour.
Did the warden give
the green light...
Wait a minute. We're get...
I got something.
Tal?
Tally: Fernando?
Bucky: That's her.
Tal, can you hear me?
Bucky: Where is she?
Prisoner: Open this door!
Open it! Open it!
Tal, can you hear me?
Are you ok?
I'm ok.
Tally: Fernando,
can I talk to you?
Do you have this
situation under control?
Under control.
How is that possible?
Tom, they're claiming control.
Ask her about that.
Tally, we're getting word
that the situation there
is under control.
You're feeding live,
tal... national.
Uh... Well, it's
under control, tom,
but the inmates have control...
Which inmates?
Or, more accurately, one group
of inmates has control.
This has not been good news
for other inmates.
Of the 8 men I can confirm
have been killed today,
none... repeat...
none have been guards.
One, uh...
Of the 8 dead inmates,
one was, apparently,
shot by tower guards.
The other 7, it appears, were victims
of continuing racial vendettas here...
Fernando: No! No more
gang shit, tally.
Fernando, how much more time do
you have left on your sentence?
<i>Ah, madre...</i>
I got 15 months, and then
I come up for parole.
You know what's going to happen
when the guards come in.
You could end up dead.
I could end up dead
on biscayne boulevard.
Tom: It is now 2 A.M.
The riot has been underway
for close to 10 hours.
We're back live with wfil
Philadelphia's tally atwater,
who is inside holmsberg prison.
Tally's been
keeping us informed
from her bird's-eye
view of the riot.
What's the mood?
Describe the scene,
can you, tally?
The mood here, tom, is ominous.
Inmates are prepared for what they
believe will be the final assault,
probably before dawn.
Are they armed? These
inmates have weapons.
They give every indication
they will fight
because to fight
is a way of life.
It's a way of life
learned on the streets.
To see the faces inside
this prison is to remember
that on such streets,
crime is just a way of
taking care of business.
This is tally atwater
inside holmsberg prison.
Tally: Shut it down.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go...!
Doug: You're watching
live footage
of the riot that broke out
earlier at holmsberg prison.
Wfil's tally atwater
and cameraman ned Jackson
are inside the prison.
As you can see by these dramatic
pictures that we're getting,
the tac team
has entered the prison.
In the next minutes and hours,
the matter will be resolved.
The only question is...
How high the price?
Tal?
Can you hear me, tal?
You can see they're
chaining them in the area.
Hold onto that shot, guys.
Aah!
Stand by. We've lost tal.
We're still feeding. When we get
her back, we'll let you know.
Tally: 24 hours ago,
I came to holmsberg prison
to report on how governor George McBride's
new "get tough" prison policies
were affecting one convict.
It was meant to be a day in the
life of Fernando buttanda.
Fernando buttanda
was not a good man
by society's standards.
He was not even a good man
by his own standards.
Recently, however, in a job
training program here at holmsberg,
Fernando began
to learn nursing skills.
He volunteered to work
in the prison hospital,
at some risk to himself,
with violent patients.
He was good at it.
He liked doing it.
A month ago,
governor George McBride...
who is campaigning
for reelection
on the pledge to reform
other Pennsylvania prisons,
as he has reformed holmsberg...
canceled this program.
"A prison is about punishment."
He added, "it is not
about another chance."
During the next hours and
weeks, we'll hear a lot
about what prisons
should and should not be:
A lot of opinions
as to why this riot occurred
in this place at this time.
Many fixes will be proposed,
many answers formulated.
Inside holmsberg prison
last night,
answers were hard to come by.
What we do know
is that 15 prisoners died,
including Fernando buttanda.
This is tally atwater,
<i>wfil news,</i> holmsberg prison.
Anchor: Thank you, tally.
And we'll be recapping...
You were good.
No. You were great.
Tally atwater for mark lindner.
This is as far as I go.
One floor up, first
door on your left.
Ms. Atwater, I'm mark lindner.
It's good of you
to come and see us.
Would you like some coffee,
a soft drink, mineral water?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Karen, you know
what calls to put through.
This is buford sells.
How do you do?
It's a real pleasure.
Hello. And Gabe Lawrence.
How are you?
Have a seat.
For better or worse,
we're the 3 musketeers who
run the news division.
That was quite a job you
did for us at holmsberg.
Thank you.
Don't get up.
So.
So.
Tell me what they said.
Washington bureau...
Weekend anchor, evening news.
I said I'd think about it.
Waiter: Can I help you?
Um... We'll wait.
Sure.
Weekend anchor?
What's to think about?
Well, actually, what I think
is we make a pretty good team.
It's no good that way.
We tried it. It doesn't work.
We did holmsberg. It worked.
No. You did holmsberg.
And you did it yourself,
and you were terrific.
I've been making some calls,
and I think there's a story
in Panama nobody's telling.
I have a hunch that some people
would like to see us get
into a war down there
because they're not
that enthusiastic
about turning over
the canal in '99.
We can do Panama.
Networks aren't interested.
We can make them interested.
I can go into Panama city,
spend a few days,
pick up a local crew...
And head out.
You already set this up.
Tally...
I've gotta do this by myself.
Do you see that?
Wasn't the whole idea
for us to be together?
It was,
but it can't be me
putting wine on ice
while you wrap up
the evening news.
And it can't be you
turning down a story
because you don't wanna
leave me at loose ends.
Do you wanna be with me?
So much it hurts.
I don't wanna be anywhere
where I can't see
you or touch you.
I don't wanna be anywhere
where I can't hear your voice
or tell you a story
and see this great smile.
But I've got a narrow-but-very-definite
window of opportunity...
And... If I can get this...
And if...
If you get lucky...
Gold. Gold.
Do you really want this?
You made me want it.
Flight 811 to Miami,
Belize, and Panama
is in its final
boarding process.
All passengers
should be aboard.
We haven't had enough time.
Hey...
Every day we have is one
day more than we deserve.
I'm gonna tell you the best
story you've ever heard.
Uh, darling?
Oh!
Been a while since
I've done this.
Have fun.
Hey!
Stay upwind.
Tom:...To explore possible
repercussions to our economy.
Meanwhile, the dollar
continued its free fall
against the yen
and the deutsche mark.
We'll be discussing this
latest run on the dollar
tomorrow night
on<i> American notebook</i>
with treasury secretary
Willis Barry.
This is tom orr.
I'll see you then.
Tally, how are you?
Go on, sit down. It won't bite.
Oh, and, tally...
Don't get too attached
to that chair.
You know, I call it "home."
Have you got the uplink?
We're gonna try out
a new stringer.
Just chat him along. We
got a couple of minutes.
That one?
Buford: Satellite time
costs money, boys!
Run him out here.
Here he is.
That has to be the dirtiest,
scruffiest-looking
excuse for a reporter
I have ever seen.
My God... It's
the anchor person.
New hairdo, I'll bet.
Shoes shined...
Hey, buford,
get the hell outta there.
I wanna talk to my wife
without you listening in.
Miss me?
Occasionally.
When are you coming home?
I got a few more days
in the boonies...
Then I can wrap this up.
Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.
I nailed it.
You look so good.
Sorta glad I can't see you.
The mind...
it's a wonderful, dirty thing.
Wait.
Just one more thing
I wanted to tell you.
God, I'm having fun.
Speech! Speech! Speech! Come on.
Ok. First of all...
Ok. I'm gonna try not to cry.
Um... This is for Warren,
who couldn't quite make
the party,
but is definitely
on his way back home
from what he calls
"hog heaven."
To Warren. To Warren. To Warren!
And ned, who is
one of two people
who knows what I really
look like in the morning.
Where is he?
Ned?
What are you doing?
Ha ha ha!
Tom:...Reports are sketchy,
but we are receiving word that
in a remote section of Panama
near the Colombia border,
a freelance news crew came under
heavy fire within the past 24 hours.
The group included
at least one American.
Tom: We still don't know
if the survivors...
Woman: I've liberated
the hard liquor!
Shh, shh!
We can now confirm by this
startling unedited footage
that the American
traveling with this crew
is former ibs newsman
Warren justice.
Oh, he's not... it's ok. Warren: Come on.
I'm not...
Get down!
It's now definitely been confirmed that
at least 2 crew members survived...
He's ok. He made it.
Tom: We are trying to technically
enhance these pictures
so we can confirm exactly
what we are seeing.
We still don't know what
motivated this attack.
Information is contradictory,
but it appears to indicate
that an ambush took place
at this remote airstrip near the
Colombian border in Southern Panama.
We are hearing via telephone
hookup with sources in Panama
that justice was investigating
reports about the arming of groups
violently opposed to turning
over the Panama canal.
His shoes...
Excuse me.
We've now confirmed that the
American traveling with this group,
former ibs newsman
Warren justice,
was killed today in Panama.
Warren justice was a seasoned
journalist and a good friend.
No, he can't be dead...
Shh!
As we continue...
To sort this out,
we'll take a short break
to allow our stations
to identify themselves.
We'll have more on this breaking
story in Panama when we return.
No...
This is <i>the ibs evening news.
</i> I'm tom orr.
Questions
emerging from information
uncovered by former ibs newsman Warren
justice before his death in Panama
are beginning to seem
uncomfortably close to home
to some people in Washington.
This network
is just now editing tape
obtained by justice
in the days before his death.
Information in this tape
seems to change the face...
Tom v.O.: You know those faces.
You remember those stories.
They were the men and women
who made ibs news, this year,
number one in 5 of
your 12 top markets.
Next year,
you can count on this:
We're going to be even better
because the ibs news team just
acquired a stealth weapon.
You may not have
caught her at wmia,
you may have missed her
at wfil,
but none of us will soon forget
her award-winning coverage
of the riots
at holmsberg prison.
Tally: What we in the news
business must never forget is
we are only as good
as the stories we tell.
Tom: She arrived in our
business from smalltown, U.S.A.
Woman: You could say that Sally
Ann knew exactly what she wanted,
and what she wanted
was to be number one.
Tom: And "Sally Ann"... as her
family liked to call tally...
wouldn't take no for an answer.
Tally: Everyone said, "you
want a job in television,
you have to make a demo tape."
So... I made a demo.
Why hire Sally?
Because I'm Sally, and
I'm going to be a star.
Warren: So she walks into my
office that first day in Miami...
skinny, God-awful clothes,
not much going for her,
wanting to be
anybody but herself...
and I make her get my shirts,
I make her get the coffee...
I shoot down all
of her stories...
But she was tougher than me.
She was already something.
She was already
the sun and the moon...
All by herself.
Lindner: We at ibs hold a
special place in our hearts
for that honored handful
of newsmen and women
whose lives and careers, in the
course of bringing home the news,
have been cut tragically short.
We salute them.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to begin
a new generation at ibs...
tally atwater.
Panama turned out to be
a big story for ibs.
It didn't start that way.
It... Started with one reporter
who... Had a hunch.
He had a hunch,
and he went out alone,
and he did all the legwork,
and at the end of the day,
he got it.
Which is what doing this
is all about.
I... I didn't always think
that I thought if I ever stood
up at something like this,
it would be about glory
or, um... Showing people.
It's different.
I know that now.
I'm only here for one reason:
To tell the story.
My husband told me that
not so long ago.
