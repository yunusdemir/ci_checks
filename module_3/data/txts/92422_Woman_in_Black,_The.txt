MRS. FISHER: My babies!
[CONTINUES SCREAMING]
Arthur?
[EXHALES]
JOSEPH: Daddy?
Coming.
[SLOSHING]
[LOCKING BRIEFCASE]
Do you like it, Daddy?
Very much.
You didn't look at it properly.
Of course I did.
That's me, that's Nanny,
that's Mummy, and that's you.
Why do I look so sad?
That's what your
face looks like.
ARTHUR:
Oh, it is, is it?
I wish you didn't have
to go away from me.
Me, too.
But we'll have
the whole weekend
in the countryside, won't we?
See, tomorrow,
then Thursday,
and then we're back together.
Not long at all.
You look just like your mother.
Have you got the train tickets?
Yes, we've got
the train tickets.
And you know all the times?
Yes, we know the times.
Okay, I've got to go.
Don't want to be late.
Go, we'll be fine.
We'll see you Friday.
See you.
Wave bye-bye.
I know you've
had it rough, Kipps,
and I'm sympathetic
to your situation.
But we can't carry passengers.
We're a law firm,
not a charity.
Good.
I take it Tomes has briefed you
on Mrs. Alice Drablow
of Eel Marsh House.
Died. Last month.
Years since I went there,
of course.
The old widow didn't
greatly care for visitors.
No children?
A boy. Died young.
Many years ago.
I'll let you have the details
to read on your journey.
But, principally,
you're going to go through.
Mrs. Drablow's documents.
Make sure
we've got her final will.
There's a mountain
of paperwork at the house.
It all needs to be gone
through. Every page.
Very good.
We've been dealing with
a local man, Jerome.
But he's not really
been cooperating.
What I'm hoping, Kipps,
is that you'll
seize this chance
to prove your dedication
to pursuing a future
with this firm.
This is your final warning.
[STELLA SCREAMS]

[LAUGHS SOFTLY]
I'm very sorry,
Mr. Kipps.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
Have we passed
Crythin Gifford yet?
Next stop.
So, you're up from London?
I am.
Trying to sell Eel Marsh House?
You won't find a local buyer.
Are you staying
at The Gifford Arms?
Yes.
It's a bit of a walk
from the station.
I can give you a lift.
It's on my way home.
Thank you.
Samuel Daily.
Arthur Kipps.
ARTHUR: It's a beautiful
car, Mr. Daily.
DAILY: First one in the county.
Still scares the locals.
Here we are.
Well, thank you.
Very good to talk
to you, Mr. Daily.
Mr. Kipps?
Would you like to have supper
with my wife and me
tomorrow evening?
You know, we don't get to
see many new faces here.
Besides, the food in there,
reckon even a dog
wouldn't eat it.
That'd be lovely.
Thank you.
Night.
Night.
ARTHUR: Good evening.
I've a room booked
until Sunday. Mr. Kipps.
No, I'm not finding
any booking.
My office had
telegraphed ahead.
Well, we're packed
to the rafters. So...
Evening.
Good evening.
I was just telling Mr. Kipps
that we don't have any room.
Well, we can't have him out
in this weather, can we?
Not in the rain.
We must have something,
just for tonight.
We don't.
Unless you want
to put him in the attic?
Fine.
It's this way.
[SIGHS]
Actually, I was hoping
to stay till the weekend.
My son and his nanny
are traveling up to join me.
Oh, I see.
If a holiday
is what you're after, sir,
you'd honestly be
better off further inland.
It gets awfully cold here,
what with the sea mists.
BIRD: [WHISTLES]
Sea mist. Sea mist.
It's this way.
How old is your son?
He's four.
Lovely age.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
[WINDOWS RATTLING]
In.
Hello?
Mrs. Jerome?
Mr. Kipps?
Yes.
My husband went to meet you
at The Gifford Arms.
[DOOR OPENS]
This is Mr. Kipps.
I made it clear to your firm
that there was no need
for you to make the journey.
We could have sent all
the relevant documents
to London.
In any event,
you'll find all the
legal papers in here.
Mr. Fisher tells me
you're leaving today.
Not until I've taken care of
all Mrs. Drablow's paperwork.
All in there, <i>as</i> I said.
No, at the house.
I'm told there's quite
a substantial amount.
I don't expect to be finished
until Friday, at least.
It's not possible.
The Gifford Arms is fully
booked for the week.
I shall have
to contact my office.
Do you have a telephone?
Not even Mr. Daily
has a telephone, sir.
You'll not find one
in Crythin Gifford.
Fine.
I'll send a telegram.
The Post Office is closed
on Wednesday morning.
The London train
leaves in half an hour.
My colleague, Keckwick,
is waiting outside
with your luggage.
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Kipps.
Mr. Keckwick,
a change of plans.
I'm not catching the train.
You'll take me
to Eel Marsh House.
Jerome paid me to take
you to the station.
[COINS JINGLING]
Make it six and
I'll think about it.
Six shillings?
You'll not find anyone else
willing to take you there.
There you are.
Can you pick me up at 3:00?
I can't.
I need to get back
to the mainland
before the tide comes in,
else I'll be stuck
here for the day.
It will be out again by 5:00.
I'll come back for you then.
5:00 then.

No one has used Nine Lives
Causeway for years, sir.
Not since
the little Drablow boy

Eel Marsh House, it's empty.
It's not, though.
I saw a woman there.
Excuse me one moment, sir.
[DOOR OPENS]
Sir, my sister needs help.
What's the matter?
What's your name, darling?
Her name is Victoria Hardy.
What happened, Victoria?
Did something bad happen?
She drank some lye.
Our mum was out.
Lye. Oh, God.
Constable!
Is she going to die?
Constable!
It's going to be all right.
Darling, just let

It's getting late.
You'll miss your London train.
I can't leave yet.
Please don't go back
to Eel Marsh House.
Why?
Mr. Kipps, you said
you have a son?
Yes.
Go home to him.
Cherish him. Love him.
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
Mr. Kipps.
Mr. Daily.
Glad you could make it.
My pleasure.
I'm just bidding my son,
Nicholas, goodnight.
My condolences,
Mr. Daily.
It was along while ago.
There's a place ready in there
for my wife and me,
so we can all be together
again one day. Come.
I heard about
the girl in the village.
Terrible.
Are you all right?
Yes.
My wife doesn't know
and I'd be grateful if you
could avoid the subject.
Indeed, the subject
of children altogether,
if at all possible.
He would have been
about your age now.
MRS. DAILY:
Thank you, Archer.
There you are, dear.
Mr. Kipps, I've been
so looking forward
to meeting you.
I'm sorry, I must
look a bit of a mess.
I found myself without a room.
Oh! Well, then he must stay
with us, mustn't he, Samuel?
Indeed he must, my dear.
Arthur.
Thank you.
The twins won't be dining
with us tonight, Archer.
Samuel, I'm sure
Mr. Kipps won't mind.
Not at all.
Emily!
Thank you.
There.
Now, say hello
to Mr. Kipps.
Hello.
[LAUGHS]
Thank you, Archer.
There.
You're married,
Mr. Kipps?
No, don't gobble.
That's rude.
Any children?
A son.
Oh, that's lovely.
You don't want
to end up like us.
Wealthiest folk in the county
and no one to leave it to.
Did he tell you about Nicholas?
Elizabeth.
That's him.
I painted that myself.
I love to paint and sketch.
It's lovely.
Nicholas loved to sketch, too.
He still does.
Elizabeth, please.
He wants to draw you a picture.
DAILY: Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, no!
Elizabeth!
Archer, the medication!
No.
Medication!
[SHRIEKS]
No, no.
[SHUSHING]
I thought some company
would do her good.
Please, think nothing of it.
She's convinced it's our son
speaking through her.
You don't believe in this
spiritualism stuff, do you?
I didn't.
But since my wife passed
away, I don't know.
Ah. Forgive me. I didn't...
Sometimes I feel
she's still with me.
Sometimes I just
feel she's there.
In the room.
Trying to reach me.
Well, you must
be careful, Arthur.
These charlatans with all
their talk about s√©ances
and contacting the dead.
They prey on those
most in need.
They do more harm than good.
I think the worst they do
is disappoint.
I have to keep looking.
It's not natural to lose
someone so young.
But if we open the
door to superstition,
where does that lead?
It's just chasing
shadows, Arthur.
When we die, we go up there.
We don't stay down here.
[MRS. DAILY SHUSHING]
MRS. DAILY: Come on.
Come on. Lie down.
[HUMMING]
ARTHUR: I'll lose my job
if I don't get this
paperwork done.
If Jerome gives me some help,
I can go and meet my boy.
I doubt if Jerome will
be much help to you.
Stay, Spider.
Mr. Jerome?

What the hell is going on?
Complete nonsense.
Let's get you to the house.
[MEN TALKING]
You should have left. You should
have gone when we told you to.
John.
His little girl is dead.
You saw her.
You saw that woman
at the house.
Oh, for God's sake,
take him home.
This isn't helping him.
All your superstitious rubbish.
You think this is
superstitious rubbish
that took your boy?
All right.
I'll take him to the station.
[MEN EXCLAIM IN SURPRISE]
DAILY:
<i>Pay no attention to them.</i>
<i>They're still living
in the Dark Ages.</i>
ARTHUR: <i>But I did see
someone at the house.</i>
<i>Trust me, Arthur. It's just an old
place cut off from the world.</i>
The sooner the house
is sorted out and sold,
the sooner people
can move on. Here.
This'll keep you going.
The late tide is due at 11:00.
I'll come back for you then.
It's fine.
I'd rather just work
through the night.
Well, take the dog.
[CLICKS TONGUE]
Come on, girl.
Just for company.
Don't go chasing
shadows, Arthur.

<i>He is mine.</i>
<i>If you won't let me see him,

<i>You didn't try to save him.</i>
<i>You just saved yourself.</i>

Not that you can
ever replace...
She was there, Sam.
You're tired.
Get some rest.
What happened
to him, Mrs. Daily?
He was playing at the
beach with his friends
and they said the tide must
have caught them off guard.
You've seen her, haven't you?
She was there this morning
in the fire.
[SIGHS HEAVILY]
She's always there.
You mustn't blame yourself.
Blame myself for what?
For not listening
to the others.
For not staying away
from the house.
What?
I don't understand.
Whenever she's been seen,
on the causeway, on the marsh,
in the grounds of the house,
however briefly and whoever by,
there has always been
one sure and certain result.
Yes?
In some violent
or dreadful circumstance,
a child has died.
So many...
So many children.
So many children.
The Fishers' daughters
and Jeromes' eldest.
Keckwick's son, my Nicholas.
How?
Oh...
Mrs. Daily?
Mrs. Daily?
[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
She makes us...
She makes us do it.

If we can get

we can catch them
before they get on the train.
How could you
take me to Eel Marsh?
If even a small part of you
feared the stories were true?
But I never believed them.
No, you didn't want to.
There's a difference.
I had no choice, Arthur.
Either Nicholas
is in a better place
waiting for us to be
reunited one day,
or he's lost.
Now which would you
have chosen to believe?
Forgive me, Sam,
but my son is alive.
He's on his way here.
DAILY: Oh, no.
The next village is
over an hour away.
They'll have left by then.
What time is the tide back out?
5:00. Why?
If we can reunite
Jennet Humf rye with her son,
perhaps she'll finally
be at peace.
They never recovered
the child's body, Arthur.
But you have something
they never had.
