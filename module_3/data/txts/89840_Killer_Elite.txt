Yes, yes yes.
Damn.
Sit down!
Sit down kid!
What happened?

A year later Australia. Yacc Valley.
Damn!
Damn!
You have arrived. This car is so
Imputita that I can to get my hands on it.
Where is it? - The client

Go there now.
All right. Let's go.
The client knows the sheik.
Before there was a great
leader until he was ousted.
He lives in the desert since.
However, you want to do finish work.
And?
- You know the rest. Have you received the package.
Yes, I received.
What is the mission.
- I have details.
How rich is he?
- It has $ 6 billion.
I the money, do business and go. Do you understand?
- Yes.
I finished with him.
- It seems that he has not finished with you.
Danny needs the old
one. Best of the guild.
The one with balls of
steel. Remember him?
If you do not work, Hunter is dead.
Waiting for you.
This way.
- Wait for your eyes
and used to the light.
Be careful here, boy.
My son forget the rules
desert. Since the war
was finished, I left only with this map.
My first son, Hussein,
was slaughtered here ...
decopii before his ...
and here, at the battle of Murhbad brother
Its Salim, was wounded and then killed.
Killed ...
And then the third son,
I was taken ... Ali ...
Hunted and slaughtered
Desert Law says that the blood of victims
blood should be wiped with criminals.
But vengeance and I refuse
to send My last son in war.
I was exiled to the desert.
I had, wealth, everything I want ...
but I want to go home to my tribe.
But to have it, criminals
my sons to be killed.
And you need a hunter for this.
There's enough here?
- What would I use it in England?
England?
England has sent dogs to kill my sons.
S.A.S. Yes, glorious special forces.
You were at war.
- It was not war England.
They came on my land and I get killed?
Now will give an account of my law.
Doc says I have 6 months to live.
You must avenge my sons die before
or your friend will die with me.
I do not care how you kill them,
but we must recognize the box.
And the murders have
appear as an accident.
These need to reach my son.
So it goes. Spuenel English that
will sfarsii war, on both sides.
I want to see Hunter.
Danny? No, no, no.
Get out of here.
Get out of here. Now, now, now.
You see someone. I thought the girls.
No?
- I.
What does that mean?
- Had to put food on the table.
What nourishes you? 6
million, no questions asked?
You need to know it's a trap mission.
- Yes, I know.
How to say not so, when I had a ticket?
You have accepted the mission,
and I will not leave you here.
Give a man a drink.
I've Lisp. I knew that any day
without you, is a problem for me.
I was proud when you retired.
Stay out.
Too late.
You should stay away.
But I'm faster.
Motherfucker.
What are you doing?
- I take back ceasu.
Go, go!
Go to the door.
I need a weapon.
Bravo, bravo!
You do not have to shoot them.
Nice try.
- My father needs her alive.
Nice try. You know
that you found anyway.
All are found.
I know I know the targets, you know
everything. Have you used as bait.
You think I'm so smart?
Get out. And you, out.
I missed you last night at the dance.
- I do not know how to dance.
For without this, try to
make something good out of it.
You have big plans!
- Absolutely.
Do not remember me, right?
Some time has passed.
I am that.
Anne Freizer
And I took pictures
in front of the garage.
Paris, France
You owe me a chance. I
told you that we meet.
We missed you.
Yes? Here I am.
You want a piece of me?
I still can. Still you're the top.
A real killer.
Now depend on it.
- It's Hunter.
Look e. I'll go after S.A.S.
I'm paranoid. Always have coverage.
I'll try to do to speak. That
will not ever. And four, Danny ...
They are the best. SEALS
are a lot of bombonele.
And besides that, want everything
to look like an accident.
All I ask is you think about.
Over a day or two, go anyway.
Of course that enter. That we do not?
I have something to do. We are in Paris,
and I want to make a game with four.
What? You do not want?
You want this bottle tucked in the anus?
- Are you mad? You want a lollipop?
I would like!
- Grape or give you n matt?
Are you with us? - Yes. -
Why? - 6 million reasons?
And how divided? -
After spending Jumi-half.
For you two.
- Jumi-half?
But you?
- I have other reasons.
Moving.
- Yes, but stupid.
We located two killers. I want
you to locate them on others.
That's one of Murhbad.
This is Douglas Harris.
Meanwhile we must
locate. - Cheers? - Danny?
Muscat. Oman
Harris, you idiot.
Get out!
Comes to you.
I do not know who he
is. I sent to the local.
You have chosen the right man.
- I know that not done this for some time.
Protect former SAS. And
you Mike, you were SAS.
Remember. We are back in action.
What we do here, is illegal.
We must not leave marks.
That's what you call it.
It's a little sensitive.
- I lost a good soldier.
- But but the problem is that they believe in SAS.
Someone has to do dirty work.
I have a problem with blood.
But for him? E Ink.
Take care that keeps
us out of newspapers.
S do boss!
- Since we are in, right?
Lucky.
Where to stay?
Staying at the Hilton.
- Me too!
What room?
- Why would you want to know?
What we do here in
the middle of nowhere?
You said to hide? I hid
them. Could be your anus.
You're lucky.
- Shut your mouth.
I appreciate.
- Thank you.
A tip to hit him here. Case closed.
- Get out of here.
You misunderstand.
- That bitch is married.
While I've been traso.
- What have you drawn?
It is part of the past. We
are the footsteps of Harris.
What club?
- The killers.
To do the job.
It's a royal jerk.
Damn.
Where will we run?
We are in full desert.
Go to another exit.
Where is it?
Get out of here.
Someone is on our trail?
- We must move quickly.
Before Harris to find out. Let
the girl alone. Not involved.
Motherfucker.
You stay quiet. I'll talk, okay?
What you wanted to show my documents?
Have a seat.
Those bastards put you?
What happened. I have
not had enough sun?
Hi guys! I'm not saying
anything until I see lawyers.
Further back. You killed a
man on a mission. Recognize?
Disappear.
You're kidding, right?
- You were in command.
Yes.
- You killed a man.
There were witnesses.
- You killed him in front of his family.
Yes. I got it. I did.
Give me a break.
Untie me.
- High.
Hey! Gone!
We have what we need.
- And if you say that someone intervened?
His name is?
- I do not remember.
But it's in the book of the mission.
You'll find it there.
If you can read.
The bathroom.
No. Wait. You're an
asshole. D-A-B-I-T-O-C
You're dead.
In knee.
Capu put down.
Kidding.
- Stay still.
I need money for taxi.
You have to take a taxi.
I made up.
Case closed.
It seems that your friend gives best.
What do you mean?
- Your brother is dead. You're his only son ...
Do not you want to take revenge.
Let your hands dirty.
You better get used to.
It's no palace where you're
headed. Just a shit hole.
It's your worst nightmare. And will.
And when it does, you will leave here. And
when you find yourself in the desert, I pray
God help me aim.
What do you think?
- Begins to take shape.
What are you doing for dinner?
Aliens are something exotic here.
- No foreign
But you are exotic. And
something tells me that you told.
Yes.
Come! What are you waiting for?
Let's go out.
Happy Birthday!
It's a tradition here.
Happy Birthday!
Captain Steven Douglas Harris ...
Damn
Not bad at all. Address is on the back.
I talked to him.
One more thing. My boys have had problems.
- In Oman?
Someone poured.
You should see who is not?
Yes.
Looks better as time
last. - What? - Photos.
It is not plagiarism?
- Recreate a historical event.
I can see everything.
I have an address for him.
- Are you with SAS?
I was.
The best thing would be to
find the address, is to you ...
I spent the last years with this.
And besides that. We
come to you formally.
I could send someone.
I pay a few minutes?
Yes.
Vrajeala came with me. He
says part of the regiment.
I did not he could refuse.
Yes. It's full of vrajeli.
My informants say that it was canceled.
But someone asked
Murhbag. It must be him.
And you want to do us?
Find it.
If not, will I be another murder
and will be one of our boys.
Who are.
- Professionals. That's for sure.
If you come after SAS to
be professional killers.
Must have some history in the field.
Are found. I found in Oman.
Oman?
- Exceeded our people there.
Oman? Murhbad should be left alone.
- You must find "The Departed"
He's right. Have found the Book.
It says that one of the officers SAS
killed a son of Sheikh in Murhbad.
Steven Warren Crick.
It was there that night.
It's our worst nightmare. Dangerous.
Where did you get that?
The paintings have needed
blood. I killed another officer.
It was part of the business.
- That sort of thing happen.
To follow the plan, huh?
Crick. What is?
- Spends time in addition to a team.
- Why do not we go there?
No. To wait. Let's see what will happen.
There are 4. We take care of the
other three. You get that celebrity.
E Warren Crick. Without cool.
I did not.
Welcome to hell. SAS selection march.
41 miles, 28 kg of equipment,
May decrease one kg each year.
Do not even think about.
- Why not?
That's the cruel march of all the SAS.
Yes? You said it
yourself. Accidents happen.
Do not understand. Try
on Monday. It's not easy.
It means that we must slow down, right?
Insulin, ... Sign here.
He finished.
- No, Crick is still there with his mistress.
Boss. It crushed the big girl.
I want to come here soon.
Move along.
I can not believe it.
Both took care of Crick.
I think they are the same as those of the desert?
- Maybe.
It's good. But it was too late.
Good. That slows it.
Insulin puts him in shock.
Hiportermie.
And how you plan to plant them drugs?
Before the march.
SAS is one thing.
- You've trained them. Think about it.
You're crazy.
- I do it?
Danny, you're crazy.
SAS. General Headquarters. Hersford
Time is running out.
You, more Putna a minute.
We have company.
The trucks! Go to the
regiments of which belong!
In trucks. Come!
She drank half. It is enough?
Yes. I put much more, right?
Do you remember?
- Have you killed?
Yes, I killed.
Danny would not do that.
Your boy does not want
to go to the desert.
Today an officer ...
Steven Crick, was found ...
His condition was described as ...
Show some respect.
Left corner.
We brought gifts.
In Angola.
You do not want to eat those.
Where is our target.
- Another look. Do not worry.
But one more thing. After that
Yes you can work in "full sun".
There's no "after that."
Are intermediate. Looking killers.
Here's a unique perspective.
Mercenaries, heroes ...
2% of them are part of criminal.
Therefore you will not give up.
You can not escape who you are.
That's not what I represent.
And can do something else.
Let's talk business.
The third target is Simon Mc? ..
You know where to find me one?
Do not trust him, right?
Mind. - Yes. - I
have moved his lips.
Someone following us.
- I want Hunter out there. I want to end it.
I want to enjoy my money.
But first you have to
take a pair of balls.
Go after McCan
I miss you. I do not know many
about you, but even so I know.
I am convinced that everything is ok,
because when they are with you, I feel happy.
And then go and realize that
I know nothing about you.
I do not know where you go, you do.
May you somebody? -
No. - Then what is it?
Why not me? What hide?
I do not want to get into it.
- Damn.
What?
- If your friend show me a to show you that you can for blood.
Shut up.
- I understand.
He e.
- I saw McCan.
Boy, go.
- Carats.
As I said. Can not help
it. It's a psychopath.
Lord!
Why are you here?
I had a meeting with
him to the hospital.
Yes.
- Wait.
Let's go.
Mac, I am. Are you okay?
Yes. Another piece of leather
cleaner on the porch of my house.
Verify.
The name is Spy Blogen.
It is the next soldier.
Was seen. Make a hero somewhere.
It does not work and
is always in the house,
Do not know who I am? I mean,
Your secrets are small finger.
Do not worry.
- Yes, I worry.
And you should. Any movement
are mine, these lie ahead.
You want my opinion. I think
we should break to beat someone.
Yes, but nobody asks you.
You had security post, Mr. McCan.
I found through a mutual friend SAS.
See you Tuesday at 5.10 pm
I can not wait.
- See you. - Okay.
Will be there. - Okay.
- I do not understand.
McCan lives here. Will
be here for the interview.
I go on here. "Boston brakes"
Perfect.
- It was so perfect in Boston.
I lost control.
- I have done in 10 days.
10 days? I need some help.
All right.
- McCan is supervised. How do you do to recognize.
We will not get. We will do a fake.
We play where we recognize and break.
Who are you?
- I'm not flying with helicopter with a gun in your pocket.
I can call Mifwich.
- Mifwich ...
Son of a bitch who is in
command. We have questions.
About this club illegal.
I know it's not on the agenda
... Imadiat talk to you.
McCan watching it. All goes smoothly.
I know that is a friend McCan of
yours, but what business has he with us?
This is a chance to catch
those who killed Greg Harris.
Authorities have found new evidence in this case.
- What are you talking about? Everything is here!
Everyone in this room I
know that they were killed.
Everyone knows that McCan will be next.
Enough.
- We must do something.
You could take action.
- Yes, but that means all the committee.
You do not have to wait.
Spike.
- It was a trap.
I sent away. He knew that would happen.
Listen to me.
- It's much bigger than you think.
Office a lot of questions.
There are reputations to defend.
Do not do this to appear reputation ...
I can not withdraw. I can not.
- Realize that they will deny everything?
Only you know that depsre
and orders come to you.
And?
If something happens,
answer for everything.
For all?
I'm done with this commission.
You'll find them.
It should work. Do not worry.
He knows that we forced?
- Yes, yes, yes.
Tell your folks, that they send my love.
Danny?
- It's your first mission?
In my first I was a moron teeming.
- I'll be good at it.
To kill is easy.
Killing is easy, the
hard part is to win.
If I see you posting.
- Free to spread.
I'll be careful.
We arrived.
A delayed.
Stay at 10-15 m distance
and let my workspace.
Where you got your license?
It's behind me. Go with 60.
You have eye contact

Bring it to me.
Have you been, man.
Too easy.

Comes quickly.
Jump to the left.

Come pal.
Davis, where are you?
- We've got motherfuckers.
Damn.
- Let go!
Vine.
Out of the car!
How the hell you appear? -
Easy. - Stay away from the car!
Slowly.
No, no, no ...
It has no papers.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Who the hell is?
That should not happen.
- Easy, Danny.
Easy? I had to go out
there without problems.
Damn.
Who are these bastards?

Are you sure it's him?
Yes, I'm sure.
Ridcate. Coated. Move!
Stay put there, right?

I never heard of him.
So it would be.
Yes, Spike. I have.

I like sounds.

Get in the van.
Would we put. Come!
There you are, asshole.
Stay!
Boss?
What can I do that?
- Had this number.
A phone number. Very well.
This was our chance to catch on these.
Also mark it and watch

Fucking idiots.
Drop the gun.
With his left hand.
On the floor.
Push it to my foot.
I had to bring it to you. Where is it?
Not liked.
You've killed.
- Truck. Managed to escape.
He was lucky. I was
going to kill him slowly.
He was my friend?
- Yes? McCan and mine.
Davis, Greg, Harriss ...
too many names on that list.
Not to add yours. In.
Who are you?
- It does not matter.
For you, there is.
- What does that mean?
I'm done.
- Do you?
Without uniform, war,
particularly ... It's my duty.
- No one knows what to do with you.
- Wrong. I know the name but not me.
You have no idea who mess.
Yes? Do not mess with me.
Do not put your name on that list.

So it was over? You come home?
No.
Are you ready to tell me everything?
All I want to know.

not care about the past now.
Yes, Carl. That number. That was work.
It's a travel agent. Know
all donkeries in the world.
Enter.
Hello?
- Hi, Danny!
How did you get this number?
Please, Danny. Does not
sound to professional.
What do you want?
- We have a problem with the mission.
I'm done.
- You killed it who not. The left one.
And besides that, I want 10%.
- No. I did the right thing.
Tell that Sheikh. He
wants to talk to his son.
Check your friend before
to do things hastily.
What are you doing? Come to bed.
Come with me. Paris.
- What?
I expect there to where
I come from London.
We are in the middle of
the night ... They know you.
How to know about me.

Not a one.

We have an agreement. Do you remember?
No longer do that? Come on, man.
You must know it safe. You only trust.
Vrajeala. Both. Come!
You'll be killed.
Thanks for doing this.
You gotta be kidding me.
Do not give me the money
one put it between your eyes.
Another soldier killed my brother.
- No, that was.
Do you think it's a joke?
- This is the book published.
All have served in the SAS.
It has created an ambush
when he was killed.
Harris did not killed Hussein.
You told me it's him.
You're so delicate.
- Gentle? I've killed a man.
In the book you will see religion.
And Dad ...
- I know what needs Tactual.
Harris did not killed
Hussein. Yes, all of SAS e.
Where peci? We have clients.
Oman pushes his book.
It will make a press release Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I know that is in short
but I had no choice.
I'll do this alone.
- Are you sure?
I think it is.
I knew that you find here.
You look lonely.
- Are you a friend of Danny?
Hunter.
- He said good things about me?
What are you doing here?
- We take care of you.
Had to be with him.
- That's right He did not want him.
He wanted to take care of you.
For what?
- For you.
Do you think that's not coming
back. What happens after that?
I have a wife. I know the look.
We know of 10 years. Danny and I ...
wife loves it, kids love it ...
even the wild animals I like Danny.
Yes. I know that will come after you.
And when it does, you will steal.
How do you know that's the plan?
Querying a woman now.
The guy's good. Very good.
If you feel something, not
make the corner and will fight.
It ends today.
Boss. E at the entrance. I think he is.
May be it.
Climb the stairs.
- Stay firm. I'm not sure.
I got it.

Stay here.
Damn.
Face the wall.
Be careful with that.
I've found. Heading for the roof.
Heading for the roof.
Jump, jump!
E in motion. Let's go!
Do not do it.
Do not see it, boss.
He disappeared.
Move and you die.
Let's go, let's go.
What's this?
This is for the room. This is for Crick.
I just started. Give him the mask down.
Wait you out, guys.
Why is it still alive.
Why do not you kill him?
Why ask me that? I thought
you are the good guys!
Who are you? Who are you working?
We have much in common.
- Seriously?
Do you? You sit there connected
chair, gun in hand I here,
and I'll tell you what
the hell is happening?
What happened. You think it over?
Will send someone else.
And you will kill them all.
Pull the trigger.
I stopped you, I stopped them.
- I wanted to kill him.
But they will. If you put that on
Whose hands have all been completed.
- Camera. Why?
- Evidence.
Evidence that is dead.
It is the only way you can save.
If I let go, tell you
where you find them.
All right.
Leave. Sheikh Amir.
We find in Oman.
- Why?
War. I killed three of his sons.
No.
Because I am a good boy.
Throw it.
In.
The side. In knee.
You've burned.
- I do not know much about you. I care only for action.
You never know what you fight.
Or for whom.
You will never see true true.
You're the one who was a trap.
He could not give out.
Her Majesty's Government,
does not like secret societies.
Especially when there are
agreement with our interests.
You know how that desert
produce bitter oil?
You know how the contract worth?
- 3 months of life.
That's right That's right!
We send murderers. He solves his job.
And you need to sign
contracts, we consider Sheikh.
Motherfucker, you're a ... ... patriot.
Serve their country as
they did the three who died.
As you do, too.
Here it is!
Danny disappeared. But
one thing's for sure.
Will come after her.
That comes through the door with $
6 million, and it will not be there.
And who will take the 10%. I.
Boss?
Occupied by him.
It was not personal. Just business.
We've played on the fingers.
Vreasa not know why, that can kill you.
The game is over.
If you follow them, you'll
find. Anyone can be found.
Even you.
Are you here to finish this
for all. Do you understand?
That's why I'm here.
But you?
- Maybe it was over, kid.
Who says? - I. Do not we
risk no. - Let's face it.
Really?
- You entered a trap last night. Do you think that let you do it again?
I told her to go back to
it. Want to seem false?
You have to watch from a distance.
- It's nice.
Do not know, right?
- I.
It will be difficult. Life is
a shit with chocolate on top.
What does this mean?
- Talk about good times and bad ...
It seems that it has
changed life in both.
Let's finish this.
I'll cover the top. If something
goes wrong, come to you.
Sheikh wants to end it. Let's get the pictures.
- Yes?
Do not be a problem.
- From your mouth to the ears of the Lord.
Do not move until I say yes?
Who are you? What do you want?
The photos.
I would like to see things completed.
Take these my people.
Show them what I did.
I have a message for the sheik.
It's still alive.
Are false.
A little hurt.
I do not care.
What can I do ... forgotten
by God in the desert?
Do not you forgotten something?
Wait. Stay there.
Something is wrong.
See that?
- Yes.
We are in the wrong place.
Relax. I killed the car.
You again.
At the palace. What happened there?
Expect a message from you.
I was the messenger.
And?
- What do you think?
He's dead. I do not care. It
will not return to the desert.
It was all for nothing.
It's not fair.
And the winner is ...
That's what it is.
- Yes.
Do not understand, right?
Are you sure?
You have to cover my expenses.
You can not return to England.
Not after you've killed the sheik.
Who the hell are you?
- I? A voice of experience.
Where will we go? What will
you do? You'll need these.
New name. New girl. Acts in November.
You'll see.
You think you can escape?
- No one escapes.
No one.
The old man whom you killed. Not
that particular part in the war.
I tell you now. It is over for me.
- Seriously?
I wish I could say the same and
that I would live happily ever after.
It's your choice.
- I still say that the war I was finished. They say that eating shit.
And I tell you too.
Lasso it.
Where are you going?
I plan to visit?
- You never know.
If you, I'll be waiting.
We will call a taxi to the airport.
You are Danny, the boy who ran away?
- Yes.
I returned.
Where are you going?
- I do not know.
Neither do I.
We can go together?
