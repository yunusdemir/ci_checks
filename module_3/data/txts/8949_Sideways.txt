Fuck.
-Yeah.
-Miles, can you move your car, please?
-Why?
-The roofers gotta get the truck in.
-You didn't park too good, okay?
-Yeah.
All right, hold on.
Sorry.
Sorry, gentlemen.
Sorry.
Oh, fuck me!
l know l said l would be there by noon.
But there's all this work going on at
my building...
...and it's just a total nightmare.
And l had a bunch of stuff l had to
deal with this morning.
But l'm on my way.
l'm out the door right now.
Hi, Simon. Triple espresso, please.
-For here?
-No, actually l'm late.
Make it to go. And give me
a New York Times and a spinach croissant.
Thank you.
-Hello.
-Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?
-Thank you very much. Jack still here?
-Yes.
-Look what the cat dragged.
-Hi, everybody. Sorry.
Somebody finally arrived.
Finally got here, Mr. Prompt.
-Remember my kids, Alex, Helen?
-Yes, hi, how are you?
We thought you went the wrong way.
You went to Tijuana and they don't let
you back.
Yes, yes, l had to bribe them.
-Hey, Miles.
-How are you, Christine?
Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Bumper-to-bumper the whole way.
People getting an early start
on the weekend.
-Granted, l got a late start.
-We're just glad you made it.
Christine, ask Miles about the cake.
-Good idea. Come with me.
-What's this?
-Honey, we don't have time for that.
-lt's just gonna take a second.
Yeah.
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.
Yes, congratulations.
Yes, well, it's not exactly finalized yet.
-But there has been some interest.
-Your friend is modest.
Come on, Miles, don't be so modest.
lndulge them.
-Don't make me out to be a liar.
-What's the subject?
-Non-fiction?
-No, it's a novel. Fiction.
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life.
So l suppose that, technically,
some of it is non-fiction.
Good. l like non-fiction. There is so much
to know about this world.
l think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.
-lt's an interesting perspective.
-So which one do you like better?
l like them both, but if pressed,
l would have to say...
...that l prefer the dark.
Told you.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.
Bye.
Bye. Where the fuck were you, man?
l was dying.
We're supposed to be miles away.
-l can't help the traffic.
-Come on.
You're fucking hung-over.
You know you are.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. Yes.
l wanted to get us something for the ride.
Check out the box.
Why did you say my novel was being
published?
-You said you had it all lined up.
-No, l didn't.
No, no. What l said was that
there was some interest at Conundrum.
And that one of the editors was passing
it up to a senior editor.
-Sounds good. Sounds like you're in.
-No. lt's a long shot.
And besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.
l'm not gonna get my hopes up, you know.
l've stopped caring.
The hell with it. l have stopped caring.
lt sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
l can feel it.
l think this is the one.
l'm really proud of you, man.
No, don't open that now.
No, no, it's warm.
Jack, that is a 1 992 Byron.
lt's really rare, okay? l've been saving it.
-l won't open it.
-Please, don't open it!
Jack! Half of it, gone!
Hey. Shut up, okay?
Here's to a great week.
Come on.
Yes. Absolutely.
Despite your crass behavior,
l'm glad we're getting this time together.
Yeah. Me too.
l've been looking forward to this.
l thought it was never gonna happen.
Man, that's tasty.
That's 1 00 percent Pinot Noir.
They don't even make it anymore.
Pinot Noir? Then how come it's white?
Don't ask questions like that up at wine
country, they'll think you're a dumb shit.
Just tell me.
Color in red wines comes from the skins.
This juice, on the other hand, is free-run.
So that there's no skin content....
Did you read the latest draft?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-And?
lt's great.
l mean, it's-- So many improvements.
Much tighter. lt just seems...
...l don't know,
more congealed or something.
What about the new ending?
Did you like that?
Oh, yeah. New ending vastly superior
to the old ending.
There is no new ending.
Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Well, maybe it just seemed new because
everything leading up to it was different?
Yeah, that must be it.
-Why are we getting off?
-I just wanna make one quick stop.
-For what?
-I thought we'd say hello to my mother.
-Your mother?
-Look, it's her birthday tomorrow, okay?
I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.
It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.
I didn't know. How old is she gonna be?
Seventy-something.
Here. Hold this forjust a second.
Thank you.
-Surprise.
-Surprise.
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.
Oh, my God! Miles and Jack!
What a surprise!
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers.
-Happy birthday, Mom.
-They're from both of us.
A famous actor bringing me flowers
for my birthday!
-Don't I feel special!
-And champagne.
The famous actor's getting married
next week.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice?
I hope that girl knows how lucky she is.
Marrying no less than Derrick Sommersby.
That was like 1 1 years ago, Mrs. Raymond.
Well, you were wonderful in that show.
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin.
Damn, Miles, why didn't you tell me you
were coming...
...and bringing this handsome man?
Look how I'm dressed.
-I gotta run and put my face on.
-You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Oh, stop it!
Make yourselves comfortable.
-You boys hungry?
-Yeah, I'm hungry.
Just a snack.
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond,
absolutely delicious.
-They're just leftovers.
-Is this chicken?
I could have made something fancier
if someone had let me know...
...that a certain someone was coming
for a visit and bringing a special friend.
It was a surprise, Mom.
And I could have already put clean
sheets on the other bed and the foldout.
You are staying.
Wendy, Ron and the twins...
...are picking us up at 1 1 :30
to go to brunch at the Sheraton.
They do a magnificent job there.
You talked to Wendy?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the twins.
No, I bet. I bet, yeah.
Well, you know,
Jack is pretty eager to get up to....
You know, but, yeah, absolutely,
you know, we'll see how it goes.
Well, you boys do what you want.
I thought it would be nice for us to be
together as a family on my birthday.
I'll be right back.
And what was that other one you did?
The one where you were the jogger?
That was for.... Spray 'n Wash.
-Spray 'n Wash. That's the one.
-Gosh.
I remember the girl that was in it.
She was something.
I just remember you jogging.
So when's the wedding?
Next Saturday, Mom, remember?
We told you.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond.
My main man.
Miles, when are you going to get
married again?
I just got divorced, Phyllis.
Two years ago, buddy.
You should get back together
with Victoria.
She was good for you.
She was good for you...
...and so beautiful, and so intelligent.
You knew her, right?
Oh, yeah, real well. Still do.
I'm worried about you, Miles.
Do you need some money?
Jack.
Jack, come on.
Jack, no, no, no. She'll wake up.
Fuck. Too early in the morning for that,
you know what I mean?
She's a kid, for God's sake.
As if she would even be attracted
to guys like us.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking
at me all the time, all ages. Dudes too.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price.
-It's never free.
-You need to get laid, Miles.
That's gonna be my best man gift to you
this week.
-I'm gonna get you laid.
-Wonderful.
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate,
penknife or any of that other horseshit.
-I'd rather have a knife.
-No.
You've been officially depressed
for like two years.
You're a negative guy anyway.
Even back in college.
And now it's worse.
You're wasting away...
...teaching English to eighth-graders when
they should be reading what you wrote.
-Your books.
-I'm working on it.
Not working hard enough.
-You still seeing that shrink?
-I saw him on Monday.
I spent most of the time helping with
his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy.
What is that stuff you take? Xanax?
-And Lexapro, yes.
-Well, I say fuck that too.
You need to get yourjoint worked on.
Jack, Jack...
...this week is not about me,
it is about you.
I'm gonna show you a good time.
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
play some golf...
...eat some great food, enjoy the scenery...
...and we're gonna send you off in style,
mon frère.
And get your bone smooched.
You know what,
let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit...
...and hit Sanford first, okay?
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.
They make top-notch Pinot
and chardonnay.
One of the best producers in the county.
-I thought you hated chardonnay.
-No, no. I like all varietals.
I don't like the way they manipulate
chardonnay in California.
Too much oak
and secondary malolactic fermentation.
You see, the reason that this region is
so good for Pinot...
...is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...
...and it just cools down the berries.
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.
It doesn't like constant heat or
humidity. Very delicate.
Let me show you how this is done. First...
...hold the glass up and examine the wine.
Look for color and clarity.
Just get a sense of it, okay?
Thick, thin, watery, syrupy?
-Okay?
-Okay.
Now, tip it.
What you're doing is checking for color
density...
...as it thins towards the rim.
That's gonna tell you how old it is.
It's usually more important with reds.
Now, stick your nose in it.
Don't be shy. Really get your nose
right in there. Really....
A little citrus.
Maybe some strawberry.
Passion fruit.
And there's just, like, the faintest
soupçon of, like, asparagus...
...and there's just a flutter of, like,
a nutty Edam cheese.
Wow.
-Strawberries, yeah. Strawberries.
-Good.
Not the cheese.
Put your glass down, get some air into it.
Oxygenating it opens it up.
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important. Smell again.
That's what you do
with every one of them.
-When do we drink it?
-Now.
How would you rate this one, Miles?
Usually they start you on wines with
learning disabilities.
But this one is pretty good.
This is the new one, right?
Just released two months ago.
-Nice job.
-We like it.
-You could work in a wine store, Miles.
-Yeah. That'd be a good move.
Are you chewing gum?
You think I'm making a mistake marrying
Christine?
Do you think I'm doing the right thing?
Tell me the truth.
I mean, you've been there.
Well, you know, I think that you waited
for some good reason...
...and you proposed to Christine
for some good reason.
So I think it's great.
It's time.
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.
I mean, look at me. You know,
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad has been talking about
bringing me into his property business...
...showing me the ropes,
which is something...
...considering how long it took him
to get over my not being Armenian.
So I'm thinking about it.
But I don't know.
It might get a little incestuous.
But Mike does great.
-High-end stuff.
-So you're gonna stop acting?
No way. No.
This would just provide some stability.
I can always squeeze in a commercial or
an audition here, there.
Keep myself in the game in case
something came along.
But we're not getting any younger.
No, no.
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Hey.
-Miles. Long time no see.
-Sir. Very nice to see you.
-Hey, when's your novel coming out?
-Soon, soon.
This is my buddy Jack.
He's getting married.
-My condolences, man.
-What are you pouring?
We have got a lot of good stuff.
We have the new Bien Nacido, you want a
taste?
They make their own wine here, it's
just outstanding. Very special.
So, what do you think?
Tighter than a nun's ass.
Good concentration. Nice fruit.
Pour us a couple, will you?
Yeah, it's tight.
There you are, gentlemen.
I will leave you the bottle, and it is
good to see you.
Hey, man...
...here's to my last week of freedom.
It's gonna be great.
Here's to us.
Miles, check out that chick.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
-You know her?
-Sure I know Maya.
-You know that chick?
-Yes.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come
up here. It's practically my office.
Occasionally, I have a drink with the
employees.
Yeah, Maya's great. She's worked here
like a year, year and a half.
-She's incredibly hot.
-Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.
Check out the rock.
That doesn't mean shit.
At Sushi Roku,
Christine wore an engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.
You think it worked? No.
How do you think I met her?
This gal is married to some philosophy
professor at UC Santa Barbara.
What's a professor's wife doing
waitressing? Obviously that's over.
You don't know anything about this
woman.
Calm down. Let's just eat.
-Oh, hey, Miles.
-Oh! Hi, Maya.
How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.
You look great, did you lose some
weight?
No, actually, but thank you.
Busy night, huh?
Sunday.
-You guys been out tasting?
-You know it, you know it.
This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
-Hiya.
-Hi.
Well, it's good to see you.
-Bye, Miles.
-Back to work.
Jesus, she's jamming.
And she's obviously into you.
What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Now we're getting somewhere.
-She likes Pinot.
-Perfect.
She's a fucking waitress in Buellton, Jack.
How is that ever gonna work?
Why do you have to focus on the
negative?
-You see how friendly she was to you?
-She works for tips.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
I can also recommend the ostrich steak,
very lean, locally raised.
Hey, Gary.
-Highliner, please.
-You got it.
-That's on us.
-Oh, hey, guys.
-Do you mind?
-No, no.
-You sure?
-Please, light up.
In fact, would you like to join us?
Sure.
How's that book coming?
You were almost finished last time we
talked.
I finished it.
Good for you.
It's getting published.
That's actually why we're up here
celebrating.
Well, congratulations, that's fantastic.
-Cheers.
-Thanks.
Are you a writer too?
No, Maya, I'm an actor.
Really, what kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. You know,
I used to be a regular on a couple of series.
But lately it's been a lot of
commercial work.
Nationals mostly.
Anything I might know?
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?
Now with the low, low 5.8 percent
APR financing.
That's hilarious, you sound like one of
those guys.
-I am.
-You are not.
He is.
Consult your doctor before using.
Side effects may include...
...hives, loss of appetite.
If you have diabetes or a history of
kidney trouble, you're dead, asshole!
So, what are you guys up to tonight?
We're pretty wiped.
You know, I think we're just gonna go
back to the motel and crash.
Yeah, I guess it's kind of a long drive
up here.
-Where are you staying?
-The Windmill.
Windmill.
The girl is looking to party and you tell her
we're going to the motel and crash?
-Jesus, Miles!
-Well, I'm tired, Jack. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you, man.
She lit up when she found out your
novel was getting published.
Now I have another lie to live down.
Thanks, Jack.
Just trying to get you a little action.
I would appreciate a little bit of help.
It didn't seem like that's what was
going on. You were all over her.
Well, somebody had to do the talking.
And by the way, I was right.
She's not married.
-How do you know?
-No rock.
When she came to the bar, she was sans
rock.
What's the plan for today, Miles?
Good. We head up north,
begin the grape tour up there.
Work our way south, so that the more we
drink...
...the closer we get to the motel.
What's your problem?
What is it?
I'm going to get my nut on this trip,
Miles.
And you are not gonna fuck it up for me
with all of your depression...
...and anxiety, and nag-head, downer shit.
Well. Now the cards are on the table.
Yes, they are.
And I am serious.
Do not fuck with me, Miles.
I'm going to get laid before I get
married on Saturday, do you read me?
Sure, big guy, absolutely.
Loud and clear, whatever you're saying.
It's your party, evidently.
Why don't you just go out, and I'll
catch a train back.
No, Miles.
This is our week to get crazy.
We should both be cutting loose.
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.
It's something we should share.
-This is our syrah.
-Okay.
-Yeah? Like that?
-That's a big one.
It did sit with the skins for two weeks
in an open-top tank.
Okay, that would explain all the
tannins, no?
Well, it's a young wine. So as the wine
ages, the tannins will dissipate.
-Excuse me forjust a minute.
-Good stuff.
Fill up there, bub.
This is our estate chardonnay.
There's a girl that knows how to pour.
What's your name?
-Stephanie.
-Stephanie.
Nice.
-So, what do you think?
-Quaffable, but far from transcendent.
I like it. Tastes great.
-Oaky.
-Cabernet franc.
This is the fifth year we've made this
varietal.
Very few wineries around here do a
straight cab franc.
It's from Santa Maria.
And it was a silver-medal winner at
Paso Robles last year.
I will tell you, I've come never to
expect greatness from a cab franc.
This one is no different.
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--
I don't know, tastes pretty good to me.
So do you live around here, Stephanie?
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
I agree with you about cab franc.
We're just over in Buellton.
-Windmill Inn.
-Oh, yeah?
Do you happen to know
a gal named Maya?
-Yeah, sure. Yeah, I know Maya.
-Yeah? No shit.
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.
Can we move on to the syrah, please?
Chomping at the bit, huh? Sure.
This is our estate syrah.
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
I know, I need to be spanked.
Excuse me.
Syrah?
-Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.
-You have the keys.
I do? In my pocket.
-So we're on.
-What?
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight, so we're all going out.
-With--? With Maya?
-Yeah.
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.
This chick Stephanie, she's got it all
going on.
Well, she is cute.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you
almost tell her I'm getting married?
What's the matter with you?
-Nice, huh? Yeah.
-It's beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view.
You know, once we had a picnic here,
and we drank a '95 Opus One...
...with smoked salmon and artichokes,
but we didn't care.
Oh, man. She has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.
She could even differentiate all
different kinds of Italian wines.
Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.
Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with that.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.
She got remarried.
She what?
When?
About a month ago.
Maybe six weeks.
To that guy? The guy with the restaurant?
Miles.
I'd like to go home now.
-Miles, get out of the car.
-Would you drive me back to the motel?
-You know what?
-She bringing him to the wedding?
What do you think?
Why didn't you tell me about this before?
I knew you'd get so freaked out...
...that you wouldn't come on this trip.
But this is the perfect place to tell you.
We're here to forget about all that
shit. We're here to party.
I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.
Persona non grata.
Everybody will be holding their breath
to see if I get drunk and make a scene.
No, no. Look.
I talked to Victoria, okay? She's cool.
Everybody's cool.
I'm sorry, you've been talking--?
Behind my back, you've been talking
about it?!
What are you doing?
Come back here.
Miles!
Come here. Give me that bottle.
Back off, Jack. Back off, man!
-Give me that bottle.
-No.
Miles.
There's a lot of people out there that
think they can make it.
What better thing in life than to chase
the dream...
...and not be afraid of going after it?
Next play, chance for a birdie.
A five-shot lead.
I'm gonna go for a swim.
Get the blood flowing.
-You wanna come?
-No, I wanna watch this.
Okay.
Start this ball one or two inches
outside the left edge.
-Great putt.
-Absolutely. Great speed.
Miles.
Oh, Miles. Time to get up.
This fucking chick in the Jacuzzi.
Oh, dude, this place is wide open.
I'm going fucking nuts up here, man.
Hey, what should I wear?
I don't know. Something casual but nice.
They think you're a writer.
Do you have any other shoes?
Hey, honey.
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.
We're getting ready to go to dinner...
...so I thought I'd say good night now.
Yeah. I miss you too.
Yeah. And I love you too.
Just try to be your normal humorous self.
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Remember? People love that guy.
Don't forget, your novel is out in the fall.
Oh, really? How exciting. What's it called?
Come here, Miles. Come here.
Do not sabotage me.
If you wanna be a lightweight, that's
your call, but do not sabotage me.
-Aye, aye, captain.
-If they wanna drink merlot, we drink it.
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I'm not drinking fucking merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles. Jesus.
No merlot.
Did you bring your Xanax?
All right. Come here.
Do not drink too much, do you hear me?
I don't want you passing out or going
to the dark side.
-No going to the dark side.
-Okay.
Hi. Just looking for some friends.
-Good evening, ladies. How are you?
-How are you?
Hello, Maya.
You look gorgeous. You both do.
Thank you. Not so bad yourself.
Thanks, thanks. So, what's good here?
-What's this you're drinking?
-This is the Fiddlehead. Sauvignon blanc.
-I see. Is it good?
-Try it.
-So, what time did you close up at--?
-Kalyra.
-Kalyra.
-Kalyra. Actually I got out of there...
...around 5:30, 6.
-Yeah.
-Still some stuff to do.
-That's really nice.
-Aged 1 2 months in oak. French oak.
Really? Sauvignon blanc. Interesting.
The wine maker comes into the
restaurant.
-What do you have to do there to close?
-Close up the register. Clean up...
...and put stuff away.
Put the glasses up for the next day.
-Right.
-Just small stuff.
-Hints of clove.
-Yes. I know, I love that.
Yeah.
-Sorry. It's good.
-No, we'll get you a glass.
Now we're thinking. Good.
Oh, he can say it and it's not disgusting.
-I didn't hear him say that.
-Whenever I say something he says....
Very good.
Actually, no, that one, not this one.
I'm having that too.
-Right?
-Oh, yes.
-That's what I'm saying.
-We have corn chowder.
For entrées, we have medallions of pork...
...dusted with truffles,
with a roux vegetable fleuron...
...and wasabi-whipped potatoes....
-You have to explain, like....
-Yes.
Miles, what does this remind you of?
I mean with the yellow light, in the
glass.
After all, tonight, we are celebrating
Miles' book deal.
Published author.
-Wow, Miles.
-Well, in that case....
It's a traditional way of dealing with
wine.
It's a controversial way of dealing
with wine.
So everyone's going back to that.
There's a sort of constant lapping.
It's a fishing lake.
Your lips are soft.
-Okay.
-Harry is, right? He's in the whole thing.
What do they call it...?
What the hell am I trying to say?
Hello.
Victoria.
Miles?
Well, well, Victoria, how the hell are you?
What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing, I just heard that you got
remarried.
Congratulations. I didn't think you had
the stomach for another go-round.
Oh, Miles, you're drunk.
Oh, just a little local Pinot. You know,
a little burgundy, a little Côte de Berne.
-Where are you?
-A little place in Los Olivos.
New owners, cozy ambiance.
Excellent food too. You should try it.
I thought of you at the Hitching Post
last night.
Hello.
Don't call me when you're drunk.
No, I just wanted to let you know...
...that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...
...so just in case you were dreading
some sort of, you know, run-in...
...or something like that, well,
worry no more. I won't be there.
That's my little wedding gift to you
and what's-his-name.
What is his name?
-Ken.
-Ken. Right. Ken.
-I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.
-You know, it's just, I heard about this...
...for the first time today.
Your getting remarried, that is.
And I was kind of taken aback.
Just hard to believe.
I guess I thought maybe there was still
a chance for us...
...somewhere down the road, and I just....
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't
come to the wedding.
Alrighty, Vicky. Whatever you say.
You're the boss.
Welcome back.
Take it easy.
-Are you okay, Miles?
-Yes, I'm fine, thank you.
-Excuse us, gentlemen.
-Sure.
Don't take too long. Okay. Bye, girls.
What the fuck! What is up with you?
You remember our little talk outside?
Get your shit together.
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Where were you?
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
-No.
-Why do you always have to do this?
Victoria is gone. Gone, poof. In the wind.
I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.
She's great.
She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.
I mean, what is this morose, comedown
bullshit?
These girls wanna party with us, huh?
And what was that 1 0-minute lecture on,
what, Vouvrays?
Are you kidding me? Who gives a fuck?
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with
the whole scenario.
Have you forgotten all the bad times
with Victoria?
How small she can make you feel?
Isn't that why you had the affair with
Brenda?
Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.
Have you noticed how Maya looks at you?
Now come on, man.
You got her on the hook.
Reel her in, let's ratchet this up a notch.
Here, drink some agua fría.
-Hey.
-Hey.
So shall we get some dessert?
We were thinking, why don't we go back
to my place?
I've got wine, some cheeses, music,
whatever.
Yeah.
Waiter.
Come here.
One for you, three for me.
You sure you wanna do this?
We're here.
-Hey.
-Where were you guys?
We took a couple of wrong turns, thanks
to Magellan here.
Hi.
Oh, Miles, Maya's in the back.
Past the kitchen.
Okay. Thanks.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Has she got anything good?
Oh, yeah.
Steph's way into Pinots and syrahs.
-Hey, Steph!
-Yeah?
Can we really open anything we want?
Yeah, yeah. Anything.
Except the Richebourg.
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?
Holy mackerel, I've completely
underestimated Stephanie.
Oh, good Lord. Look at that.
I think this guy's more our speed.
Andrew Murray. Well, okay.
So, what gems do you have in your
collection?
It's really not much of a collection,
you know.
I mean, more like a small gathering in
a cabinet.
I've never had the wallet for that.
I just have to live bottle-to-bottle.
I've got things I'm saving. Definitely.
The star would be a 1 961 Cheval-Blanc.
You've got a '61 Cheval-Blanc just
sitting there?
-Yes, I do.
-Go get it.
-I'm serious, hurry.
-I would. I would.
The '61 s are peaking now, aren't they?
-At least that's what I've read.
-No, that's right, yeah.
It might be too late.
What are you waiting for?
Oh, I don't know.
Special occasion with the right person.
It was supposed to be for my 1 0th
wedding anniversary, but....
The day you open a '61 Cheval-Blanc,
that's the special occasion.
So how long have you been into wine?
I got serious about seven years ago.
-And what was the bottle that did it?
-Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Congratulations. That's very good.
That would do it. Yeah.
Oh, wow. That's nice. That's very good.
We need to give it a minute, but that's
really tasty.
How about you?
I think they overdid it a little.
Too much alcohol, it overwhelms the
fruit.
Yeah. Yeah. I'd say
you're right on the money. Very good.
-Nice.
-Thank you.
Is that Stephanie's kid?
Yeah, that's Siena. She's a sweetie.
Cute. Cute. Where is she?
At her grandmother's. Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.
-You got kids?
-Me? No, I'd just fuck them up.
Yeah. That was the one unpolluted part
of my divorce. No kids.
-Yeah, same here.
-Good.
Let's go in there.
Looks like our friends are really
hitting it off.
Yeah, you can say that again.
So, what's your novel about?
What's my novel...? Oh, brother.
Well, it's difficult to summarize.
It starts out as a first-person
narrative about a guy...
...taking care of his father after a stroke.
And it's kind of based on personal
experience, but only loosely.
-What's the title?
-The Day After Yesterday.
Oh, you mean today.
Yeah, I mean, right, but it's more--
So it's about, like, death and
mortality or...?
Yeah....
Yeah, not really. It jumps around a lot.
That's what it's about.
You know what I mean?
You see everything from the father's point
of view and a lot of other things happen.
Parallel narratives. It's kind of a mess.
And then, eventually, the whole thing
sort of evolves, or devolves...
...into this sort of Robbe-Grillet mystery,
you know.
But no real resolution.
Wow.
I think it's great you're getting it
published.
Really. I mean,
I know how hard it is just to write it, even.
Like me.
I've got this paper due on Friday...
...and I'm freaked out about it.
Like in high school.
A paper, huh?
Yeah, I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.
Sort of chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Really?
I didn't even know that there was a
college here.
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.
Horticulture. Wow.
So do you wanna work in a winery or
something?
Maybe.
So when can I read your book?
Well, I do happen to have a manuscript
in my car.
It's not proofed or anything. So it's full
of typos, if you don't mind typos.
Oh, no. Who cares?
I'm the queen of typos.
Okay.
You know....
Can I ask you a personal question, Miles?
Sure.
Why are you so into Pinot?
I mean, it's like a thing with you.
I don't know. I don't know.
It's a hard grape to grow, as you know,
right?
It's thin-skinned, temperamental,
ripens early.
It's not a survivor like cabernet...
...which can just grow anywhere
and thrive even when it's neglected.
No, Pinot needs constant care and
attention.
In fact, it can only grow in these
really specific...
...little tucked-away corners of the world.
And only the most patient and nurturing...
...of growers can do it, really.
Only somebody who really takes the time
to understand Pinot's potential...
...can then coax it
into its fullest expression.
Then, I mean....
Its flavors, they're just the most haunting
and brilliant and thrilling and subtle...
...and ancient on the planet.
Now, cabernets can be powerful and
exalting too...
...but they seem prosaic to me for some
reason by comparison. I don't know.
What about you?
What about me?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I think I originally got into wine
through my ex-husband.
He had this big, sort of show-off
cellar, you know.
But then, I discovered that I had a
really sharp palate.
And the more I drank, the more I liked
what it made me think about.
Like what?
Like what a fraud he was.
-No, I like to think about the life of wine.
-Yeah.
How it's a living thing.
I like to think about what was going on
the year the grapes were growing.
How the sun was shining.
If it rained.
I like to think about all the people
who tended and picked the grapes.
And if it's an old wine, how many of
them must be dead by now.
I like how wine continues to evolve.
Like, if I opened a bottle today...
...it would taste different
than if I'd opened it on any other day.
Because a bottle of wine is actually alive.
And it's constantly evolving and
gaining complexity.
That is, until it peaks.
Like your '61 .
And then it begins its steady,
inevitable decline.
And it tastes so fucking good.
Yeah.
You know, I like other wines besides
Pinot too.
I don't know.
Lately I've been really into Rieslings.
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?
-Is the bathroom in the back?
-Through the kitchen.
I'll be right back.
God, you're such a fucking loser.
You make me so fucking sick.
Come on.
-Hey.
-I was just getting some water.
You want some water?
It's getting kind of late--
I should really go.
To get to the Windmill, two rights and
a left.
-Got it.
-Okay.
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.
I really did.
Good. So did I.
Okay, well, I'll see you around, then.
Did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Of course.
-Great.
-Just a second.
-Oh, wow.
-Well, I hope you like it.
And feel free to stop reading at any time.
I will not be offended.
Okay.
-Well, good night, Miles.
-Good night.
Oh, fuck.
Fucking chick is unbelievable, dude,
unbelievable.
She's nasty, Miles.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Well, glad you got it out of your system.
-Yeah, baby.
-Congratulations, mission accomplished.
-Oh, hi, Miles.
-Hi.
You didn't invite her to come with us,
did you?
Listen, a change of plans.
Stephanie's off today, so you know,
thinking about going on a hike.
We were supposed to play golf.
You know what? You go, man.
Use my clubs. They're brand-new.
They were a gift from Christine's dad.
Here, I'll pay for it.
And then later, the three of us, we can
go to the Hitching Post.
Sit at one of Maya's tables.
She'll bring us great wine.
Then the four of us will do something.
No, count me out.
Oh, I see.
Didn't go so great last night?
What a shocker.
Getting drunk and calling Victoria
didn't put you in the mood?
Dumb fuck.
-Later, man.
-Well, maybe you should check...
...your messages first.
-Oh, boy.
-She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah, okay.
-You should call her.
-I will. I'll see you.
-Right now!
-Okay, fuck. What are you, my mom?
Would you mind waiting outside?
-That was fun last night.
-Yeah. Good food.
I talked to Maya this morning.
She said she had a fun time too.
You should call her.
-Where's Jack?
-Had to make a phone call.
Miles. Miles.
Hey, man, do you have that other condom?
In my jacket.
What did Christine say?
Lucked out. Got voicemail.
Everything's cool.
-Here I am.
-Hi.
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Please dial your password and press
pound.
You have no messages at this time.
To send a message, press two.
Not now, not now!
-Hey, there you are.
-Yep.
What are you drinking?
Is it any good?
Can I get a glass, please? Thanks.
Stephanie took me out to the Pinot
fields today, Miles.
God, it was so awesome.
I think I'm really starting to get a
handle on the whole process.
The soil to the vine, the
what-do-you-call-it?
The selection to the harvest?
Then that thing they do with the big
containers where they mix it.
Neat, the whole thing.
And then we ate Pinot grapes right off
the vine.
They were a little sour, but showing
excellent potential for structure...
...down the line, I think.
Stephanie, man, she really knows her
shit.
Where is Stephanie?
She's upstairs getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
-With this chick?
-What?
Does she know about Saturday?
Well, not exactly.
I've been honest, I haven't told her
I'm available.
She knows this trip is only for a few days.
Besides, I just....
Besides what?
-Well, you know, the wedding?
-What?
I've just been doing some thinking
about it.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I might have to put the wedding on
hold, is all.
Look, I know that that could be tricky
for certain people to accept...
...at first, all right? But life is short, Miles.
I have to be sure I'm doing the right
thing before taking such a big step.
You know, that's not just for my sake.
I'm looking out for Christine's
feelings too.
I mean, being with Stephanie has
completely opened my eyes.
She's not uptight or controlling, she's
just cool.
I mean, she smells different, she
tastes different...
...she fucks different.
Fucks like an animal.
I gotta tell you, man...
...I went deep last night.
Deep.
I thought I'd get understanding from
you, but I guess not.
Understanding about what, Jack?
I might be in love with another woman.
In love, really?
Twenty-four hours with a wine-pouring
chick, you're fucking in love.
Come on.
And you're gonna give up everything.
Here's what I'm thinking.
You and me, we move up here, we buy a
vineyard.
You design the wine, I'll handle the
business side.
You get inspired, maybe you write
another novel, one that can sell.
As for me, if an audition comes up,
L.A.'s there, two hours away.
Jesus Christ, you're crazy.
You've gone crazy.
All I know is that I'm an actor.
All I have is my instinct.
-You're asking me to go against it.
-Hi, guys.
-We should probably get going.
-Yeah.
Where?
All right, here comes the tricky part.
There you go. Nice. Nice.
Okay, it's the bridge.
Golden Gate Bridge. There you go.
I mean, I've gotten over it.
Stephanie's heard this a thousand times...
...but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria
when I had a chance...
...I would've made a fortune
when they put in that....
-Home Depot.
-Home Depot, and those stores.
And your father knew about it too.
He's such a fucking chickenshit.
Always was.
Just a fucking chickenshit.
Just too scared.
-Is this bothering you?
-No, it's fine.
Hey, man, I'm gonna make sure Siena and
Stephanie get home safe.
-Maybe we'll hook up later.
-Sure, whatever.
-I'll catch a movie or something.
-Later, Miles.
Thanks, Stephanie, see you.
-Bye, Siena.
-Bye.
-Carol, it was very nice meeting you.
-I loved talking with you.
If you go out later, call me on my cell.
Okay!
-Okay, that's it?
-Yeah.
Actually, can I get a Barely Legal,
please? Thank you.
No, actually, sorry, the new one.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?
You know me, I love it up here.
How about you?
Busy for a Tuesday night. We had
a busload of old folks on a wine tour.
Usually they're not rowdy, but tonight
something was going on.
Full moon or something.
What can I get you?
-Highliner.
-Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
Maya? No, I haven't seen her.
I think she's off tonight.
-You okay, Miles?
-Yeah, I'm good.
Crap.
-Ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?
-Nope.
She really likes you, man.
Stephanie will tell you.
Could you just give me a little room,
Jack, please? Thank you.
In life, you gotta strike while the
iron's hot.
-Iron is hot.
-Sage advice, Jack.
Now remember, sit back on your heels.
Turn through the abdomen.
-Abdomen.
-Oh, fuck.
Nice.
-What about your agent? Hear anything?
-Nope.
-What do you think's going on?
-Could be anything.
-You been checking your messages?
-Obsessively.
Guess I'll have to kiss off another
three years of my life.
But you haven't heard anything...
...so don't you think
your negativity's premature?
You know, fuck the New York publishers.
Publish it yourself, Miles.
I'll chip in. Just get it out there.
Get it reviewed. Get it in libraries.
Let the public decide.
Don't come over the top.
-Stay still.
-Shut up.
It's all about stillness.
-Inner quiet.
-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
Jesus Christ, man. What the hell is wrong
with you?! Please just shut up!
-Fuck!
-What's with the hostility, man?
I know you're a little frustrated with
your life right now...
...but you can choose to be less hostile.
The fucker hit into us.
Hurry it up, will you!
-Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
-Hey, that's not cool, asshole!
-Nice shot.
-Jack-offs.
What the hell are you doing?
Oops! Look out.
Check it out.
This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.
Don't give up on Maya.
Cool chicks like that require persistence.
I don't wanna talk about it, please.
All I know is that she's beautiful, lot
of soul, she's perfect for you.
I won't feel good about this week until
I know you guys have hooked up.
Don't you wanna feel that cozy little
box grip down on yourjohnson?
Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?
If she finds out how I live, that I'm
not a published author...
...that I'm a liar, essentially...
...any interest she has
is gonna evaporate real quick.
If you don't have money at my age,
you're not in the game anymore.
You're just a pasture animal waiting
for the abattoir.
Abattoir. What is that?
-Slaughterhouse.
-Abattoir.
But you are gonna be a published author...
...because you're gonna get good news
this week about your book.
I know you are. I can feel it.
It's Stephanie. Hey, honey. Yeah.
Yeah!
Nice.
Heard you stopped by the restaurant to
see me last night.
Yeah. No. Yeah, I stopped by for a drink,
I didn't see you.
-I had class.
-Well, nice to see you now.
It's good to see you too.
Syrah. Oldest-- Hang on.
The oldest syrah grapes
in Santa Barbara County.
Did you know that?
The Pinot Noir grape has been
cultivated perhaps since antiquity...
...in Burgundy, and it is precisely
this ancient and imperative...
...winemaking knowledge,
that has contributed....
I was like, 1 6, 1 7, yeah.
-I'm gonna die!
-God.
Mom.
-Oh, hey.
-Is it too loud?
Sorry.
Uncle Jack will put you back to bed, okay?
-Come here, little sister.
-We'll be more quiet, okay?
Good night. Sorry.
I am so sorry.
My favorite is-- Has to be Chunky
Monkey....
You guys should come by the restaurant
for lunch today.
What's the latest we can get there?
About 2:30.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux-tasting
dinner in Santa Barbara on Saturday?
It's kind of pricey.
But if you wanted to go, I'd be into it.
Why don't you just stay for the weekend?
No, we have to get back Friday for the
rehearsal dinner.
What rehearsal dinner?
Who's getting married?
Were you ever gonna say anything?
Of course.
Just now I could've told you some story...
...but I told you the truth.
-Maya.
-Don't touch me!
Just take me home.
Do you know what he's been saying to
her?
-He's an actor, so it can't be good.
-Only that he loves her.
She's the only woman that's ever rocked
his world.
How he adores Siena.
How he wants to get a place with them...
...and commute when he has to.
I'm sure he believed every word of it.
Please believe me.
I was on the verge of telling you last
night, but--
But you wanted to fuck me first.
-Oh, Maya, no.
-Yeah.
You know, I've just spent the last
three years of my life...
...trying to extricate myself from
a relationship that was full of deception.
And I'm doing just fine.
And I haven't been with anybody since
my divorce.
So this has been a big deal for me, Maya.
Hanging out with you, and last night.
I really like you, Maya.
And I am not Jack. I'm-- I'm--
I'm his freshman-year roommate
from San Diego State.
There's my boy. There he is.
But who's your daddy?
Who is your daddy?
Oh, let me love you.
I am so proud of you.
-Well, that's nice.
-Okay. All right. Details. I love details.
-No.
-What?
Jesus. It's private.
Tell me what happened or I'll tie your
dick in a knot.
Let's just leave it, okay?
You didn't get any, did you?
-You're a homo.
-Right. Yep, I'm a homo, yeah.
Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened, okay?
Write out my gay confession, and I'll
sign it, okay?
Just stop pushing me all the time.
You're an infant, Jack.
This is all a big party for you, but
not for me.
Come on. I'm sorry, man.
Did you have trouble performing?
Yeah, that's a shame.
Don't answer it.
-Jack.
-Hello.
Yeah.
It's Christine.
Yeah. Yeah.
Let me call you right back.
Miles and I are kind of in the middle
of something.
No, it's nothing serious.
He's having one of his freak-outs.
I love you too. I'll call you back.
This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.
I just wanna go home.
I know what you need.
How about this one? We didn't hit it.
-Frass Canyon, that's a joke.
-Ever been in there?
-I don't have to.
-I say we check it out. We're right here.
Tastes like the back of a fucking L.A.
school bus.
They probably didn't de-stem, hoping
for some semblance of concentration.
Crushed-up leaves and mice...
...and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.
Fucking Raid.
Tastes pretty good to me.
Look. They have a reserve Pinot.
-Let me use your phone.
-What's up?
I can't take it anymore,
I gotta call Evelyn.
Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.
Hi, Jennifer, it's Miles again.
-Hi, Miles. Let me see if I can get her.
-Okay.
-You're in luck. I'll put you through.
-Okay.
Hi, Miles.
Hi, Evelyn. It's your favorite client.
How's the trip?
It's good. We're drinking some
good wines, kicking back. It's very nice.
So, what's happening? Still no word, huh?
Well, actually there is word.
I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Right. And?
And they're passing.
Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it, they
really wanted to do it...
...but they just couldn't figure out
how to market it.
He said it was a really tough call.
I'm sorry, Miles.
I don't know where that leaves us.
I'm not sure how much more mileage I
can get...
...out of continuing to submit it.
I think it's one of those unfortunate
cases in the business right now...
...of a fabulous book with no home.
The whole industry's gotten gutless.
It's not about the quality of the books
anymore, it's about the marketing.
Excuse me, can I get a pour here, please?
Sure.
There's a special on the syrah.
By the case.
Hit me again.
Excuse me. Could you just pour me
a full glass? I'll pay for it, okay?
Sir, this is a winery. Not a bar.
Just give me a full goddamn pour.
Excuse me.
Why don't you buy a bottle and go outside.
What are you doing?
I need a drink so I'm gonna help
myself, okay, pal?
-Put the glass down.
-Let go of the fucking glass, fucker.
How's that?
Whoa, buddy. It's okay.
-Get him out of here.
-Thanks a lot.
His motherjust died.
So you write another one.
You've got lots of ideas.
No, I'm finished.
I'm not a writer, I'm a middle school
English teacher.
The world doesn't give a shit what I
have to say. I'm unnecessary.
I'm so insignificant I can't even kill
myself.
Miles, what the hell is that supposed
to mean?
Come on, man, you know.
Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.
You can't kill yourself before you've
even been published.
What about the guy that wrote
Confederacy of Dunces?
He committed suicide before he was
published.
Look how famous he is.
Thanks.
Just don't give up. All right?
You're gonna make it.
Half my life is over and I have nothing
to show for it. Nothing.
I'm a thumbprint on the window of a
skyscraper.
I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue...
...surging out to sea
with a million tons of raw sewage.
See? Right there.
Just what you just said, that is beautiful.
"A smudge of excrement...
...surging out to sea."
I could never write that.
Neither could I actually,
I think it's Bukowski.
Hey, baby.
Look what I got for our favorite girl.
-You motherfucker!
-Jesus Christ.
Fucking bastard, lying piece of shit!
You're getting married on Saturday?
What was all that shit you said to me?
-Stephanie, stop!
-I can explain!
-You said you loved me!
-I do!
I hope you die!
Stop it, Stephanie!
-Fuckface! You too!
-Me?
You fucking told Maya!
No, I did not. No, I did not.
It must have been Gary
at the Hitching Post.
I think we mentioned it to him the
first night.
Did "we" mention it?
You mentioned it, asshole!
I'm fucking hurting over here!
Keep it elevated.
It's Miles.
I had to call and tell you again...
...how much I enjoyed our time together...
...and how sorry I am that
things turned out the way they did.
I think you're great, Maya.
Always have.
From the first time that you waited on me.
And while I'm at it...
...I guess maybe you should know that...
...my book is not getting published.
I thought this one had a chance, but I
was wrong, again.
Once again.
So you see, I'm not really much of a
writer.
I am not much of anything, really.
I have to have an operation.
Maybe even a couple of them.
They'll wait for my nose to heal first.
-And then they break it again.
-Oh, Christ.
-Good thing you have a voiceover career.
-It's gonna fuck that up too.
I ought to sue her ass.
The only reason I won't
is to protect Christine.
That's thoughtful.
How did Stephanie know
it was on Saturday?
We didn't get into that with Gary.
Yeah, let me think.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Yes, I'm sure, I'm sure.
And just what are you implying, Jack?
I'm pissed off at you about all this,
if you wanna know the truth.
What is Maya gonna think of me nowjust
for associating with you?
-I don't know. Sure seems fishy.
-Well....
Wherever there's a fight so hungry
people can eat, I'll be there.
Wherever there's a cop beating up a
guy, I'll be there.
I'll be in the way guys yell when
they're mad.
What's this look like to you?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
And when the people are eating the
stuff they raise....
I'm hungry.
-Nice.
-Thanks.
-And here are your Handi Wipes.
-So that's what those are.
For a minute, I thought you guys were
promoting safe sex.
That's good.
I'll have to remember that one.
I'll be back with your corn bread.
Alrighty.
Bet you that chick's two tons of fun.
You know, the grateful type?
I don't know. I wouldn't know about that.
Nice technique there, Cammi.
Thank you. All in the wrist.
You know, you look really familiar to me.
Are you from around here?
Actually, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know, you just seem familiar to
me.
Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Hang on, hang on.
Did you ever know Derrick Sommersby?
Dr. Derrick Sommersby
from One Life to Live?
Just have to imagine him with a, you
know, bandage and shorter hair.
No way. No way! Oh, my gosh!
That's great! Oh, my goodness!
Could you tell me where the bathroom is?
Yeah, it's right over there, past the
buffalo.
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe you're sitting at my table.
Listen, man. Cammi gets off in an hour.
So I was thinking I'd just hang around,
have a drink.
You know, make sure she gets home safe.
You're joking, right?
No.
Un-fucking-believable.
Can't we just go back to the motel and
hang out?
Get up early, play nine holes of golf
before we head home?
Listen, man.
You're my friend.
And I know you care about me.
And I know you disapprove, and I
respect that.
But there are some things that I have
to do that you don't understand.
You understand literature, movies, wine.
But you don't understand my plight.
Yeah.
-Holy shit!
-Fuck! Fuck!
-Jesus Christ!
-God! It's fucking freezing out there!
God. Yeah!
Vicodin, where's the Vicodin?
Here.
-Fucking chick's married, man.
-What?
Her husband works a night shift, and
comes home...
...and catches me
with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus Christ. Jesus, Jack.
You walked all the way from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five klicks, Jackson.
Fucking-A right it's five klicks.
At one point I cut through an ostrich farm.
Those fuckers are mean.
We gotta go back.
-What?
-We gotta go back. I left my wallet.
Credit cards, cash, my fucking ID.
We gotta go back.
Big deal. Don't worry about it.
We'll call now and cancel your cards.
No, you don't understand.
The wedding rings.
The wedding rings are in my wallet.
Fine. They're in your wallet.
And you left it in some bar.
Christine will understand.
No, she had to order them special.
It took forever.
They've got this design of dolphins and
our names engraved in Sanskrit.
We gotta go back, man.
Christine will fucking crucify me.
No way, no way.
-Please. Please!
-Forget it.
Your wallet was stolen in a bar.
It happens--
We gotta go and get my wallet, Miles.
Those rings are irreplaceable.
Look, I know I fucked up, okay?
I know I fucked up.
But you've gotta help me.
You've gotta help me.
Please! I can't lose Christine, Miles.
I just can't. I can't lose Christine.
I know I fucked up.
I know I did a bad thing, all right?
And I know I'm a bad person. I know I am.
But you gotta help me.
You have to help me, Miles.
Okay? Tell me you'll help me.
If I lose Christine...
...I'm nothing.
I just am....
I'm nothing.
Did she tell you she was married?
-Yeah.
-What were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till 6.
Fucker rolls in at 5.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?
This is the block.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
That's it. That's it.
That's the one right there.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, so, what's the plan?
-The plan is you go.
-Me?!
Because of my ankle. Still hurts.
Just go explain the situation, Miles.
Explain the situation?
"Yes, excuse me, sir...
...my friend was balling your wife
a couple hours ago.
Really sorry.
He seems to have left his wallet behind.
I was wondering if I could come in,
poke around."
-Yeah, just like that. That's good.
-For chrissake.
Oh, fuck it. I'll go!
I guess I have to do everything.
No. Hold on.
You think I don't fuck you, bitch?
I'm fucking you now!
I'm a bad girl! I'm a bad girl!
You picked him up and fucked him,
didn't you, bitch?
I picked him up and fucked him.
I'm a bad girl.
You liked fucking him, didn't you, you
little whore?
You caught me fucking him! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
-You are a bad bitch.
-Yeah, you caught me!
Such a whore. Oh, baby! Oh, baby!
-You're so bad!
-I am!
You are such a whore!
What the fuck!
The wallet! He's got Derrick's wallet!
-Motherfucker!
-Here's your wallet! Shit!
Open this door! Open the goddamn door!
-I'm gonna kill your ass!
-You got my wallet!
I'll find you! I will find you!
I'll find your ass!
You're mine, man! You're mine!
-You wanna let me drive?
-No, it's all right. I got it.
You know, you ought to invite Maya to
the wedding.
Somehow, I think inviting Maya to the
wedding...
...is not the right move at this juncture.
I don't know.
In fact, after all of your shenanigans...
...it'll be hard for me to
go to the Hitching Post again.
You know, there was a nice way to
respond to that.
-Come on, let me drive.
-I got it. You should rest.
You know what? I feel like driving.
Okay.
Put on your seat belt, okay?
-I was about to. What's the problem?
-Just wanna remind you to be safe.
-Jack, we missed the entrance.
-Yeah.
What are you doing, Jack?
Hey, hey, whoa!
-Hang on.
-What the hell are you doing? Jack!
What the fuck!
-You said it looked like an accident.
-What the fuck!
-I'll pay for it!
-Jesus.
Christ, Jack! Oh, for--!
Look at this!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anyone
was injured in this one.
No, no.
Watch your head.
Boy.
You broke a couple of them, you know.
-Whatever. Sorry.
-No, no, no. It's not whatever.
You fucking derelict.
-You ready?
-Just get it over with.
Okey-doke. All right.
-Well, I guess that's about it.
-You wanna come inside?
No. No, you're on your own.
All right.
-I guess I'll see you at the rehearsal.
-Yep.
-Come here. I love you, man.
-Yeah, back at you.
Miles, don't drive away until they see
the car.
I know, I know, I know. Wait a second.
How come I wasn't hurt?
Because you were wearing your seat belt.
Nicely done.
Hey, Miles.
Hi, Vicky.
Wow, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
This is Ken Cortland, my husband.
-How are you?
-How are you?
-Good, thanks.
-Nice to meet you. You're a lucky guy.
Yes, I am. Thank you.
Well, I'll just wait for you at the car.
-It was great meeting you, Miles.
-Ken.
-Well, that was big of him.
-Yeah, he's good that way.
-He's very considerate.
-That's great.
So how you doing?
Since the last time we spoke?
I don't know.
Could be better, could be worse.
So, what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Miles, that's awful.
What are you gonna do?
Back to the drawing board, I guess.
Or not. I don't know.
So anyway, you're married.
Congratulations. You look happy.
-I am.
-Good.
Seems like everybody is getting married.
Last year was all divorces.
This year it's all weddings.
Cyclical, I guess.
I guess.
Well, what do you say we hit the
reception?
Have some champagne, toast the
newlyweds.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking? Really?
I'm pregnant.
I see.
Yes, I see. Great.
Well, congratulations again, Vicky.
Boy, that's wonderful news.
-See you over there, Miles?
-Yeah.
"'The marrow of his bone,' I repeated
aimlessly.
This at last penetrated my mind.
Phineas had died from the marrow of his
bone...
...flowing down his bloodstream
to his heart.
I did not cry then or ever about Finny.
I did not cry. Even when I stood
watching him being lowered...
...into his family's strait-laced
burial ground outside of Boston.
I could not escape the feeling that
this was my own funeral.
And you do not cry in that case."
Should I keep reading the next chapter,
Mr. Raymond?
No, we'll pick up there Monday.
One new message.
Hello, Miles.
It's Maya.
Thanks for your letter.
I would have called sooner, but I
needed some time...
...to think about everything
that happened and what you wrote to me.
Another reason I didn't call you sooner
is...
...I wanted to finish your book.
I did last night.
And I think it's really lovely, Miles.
You're so good with words.
Who cares if it's not getting published.
There are so many beautiful...
...and painful things about it.
Did you really go through all that?
It must have been awful.
And the sister character. Jeez!
What a wreck.
But I have to say that....
Well, I was really confused by the ending.
I mean, did the father finally commit
suicide or what? It's driving me crazy.
Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy here
lately.
But I like winter.
So listen, if you ever do decide to
come up here again...
...let me know.
I would say stop by the restaurant, but...
...I'm not sure how much longer I'll be
there. Because I'm gonna graduate soon.
So I'll probably wanna relocate. We'll see.
Anyway, like I said, I really loved
your novel.
Don't give up, Miles. Keep writing.
I hope you're well.
Bye.
