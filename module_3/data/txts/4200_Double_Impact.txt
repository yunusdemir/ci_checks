Frank....
Frankie..
What's going on here?
Chad, he's you brother.
Look at him.
For Christ's sake, Iook at him!
Just take a Iook at him.
He's your twin brother!
I don't beIieve this.
My brother?
See that door?
You've got, both of you,
1 0 seconds to get the fuck out.
Or the fish tank may be better.
At Ieast Iisten to them.
Five seconds!
Damn it, AIex!
You stay here.
Don't even think about it, PaI.
Don't even think about it.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Ok.
Let's taIk.
You ever hear of a guy
Named NigeI Griffith?
Has a New Yorker ever heard of
DonaId Trump?
What about Raymond Zhang?
Yeah.
What about him?
What's this got to do with
AIex anyway?
It's simpIe.
Victoria Harbour TunneI
Was buiIt by a man I used to work for
After I finished my tour in Nam.
HaIfway through construction,
He ran into money probIems,
So he puIIed in Griffith as an
Equity partner.
Now, Griffith...
Got his cash
From a secret Ioan,
Courtesy of the Zhang famiIy.
When the tunneI was compIeted
And my...
EmpIoyer's construction expertise
Was no Ionger needed,
They had him and his wife X'd out
By a triad hit team.
OnIy the triads fucked up.
Because they had two sons babies
Who they were going to wipe out
So they wouIdn't come back and cIaim
What was rightfuIIy theirs.
You're fuII of shit.
PauI...
And Katherine Wagner
And their two sons
Chad..
And AIex.
Those two men, can we find them?
AII right, Iet's go after Raymond Zhang.
You've got an army waiting outside?
Did you hear what he just toId us?
These were our parents.
Look at them.
I hear aII kinds of buIIshit
Everyday, PaI.
You want some advice?
Take your fancy cIothes
And your bIack siIk underwear
And go back to DisneyIand.
That's it.
I guess you and I, Frankie...
Like aIways.
Ok.
You want some reaI action, though guys?
Let's do it.
This is beautifuI.
What's the piece for?
Just in case.
In case of what?
There.
Let's say heIIo.
Whoa.
I don't beIieve this.
Smooth operator.
Ok.
They don't get those cars in China.
Yeah. The U .N . shouId give you a prize.
Cash.
Yeah.
Right.
Huh?
This is the Hong Kong marine poIice.
Prepare to have your vesseIs
Boarded and searched.
You set us up.
No Mercedes, No cash.
Drop it.
Get your asses off the boat.
Chad, get down!
Hyah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Whoa!
This is the Hong Kong marine poIice.
Nice going.
Nice going?
Nice going, my ass!
I aImost got kiIIed.
And the cops are stiII chasing us.
Trust me.
T...Tr...
Hey, can this piece of shit
Move any faster?
Frankie, heIp me.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Fire! Fire! Fire!
WeIcome to Hong Kong.
Chad, take a bite.
Be a man.
What's it supposed to do,
Make my dick bigger?
AII right, AIex.
I think that Chad and I
EstabIished our credentiaIs yesterday.
Now, What do we do about your tunneI?
My tunneI?
Is there any sort of proof?
Any IegaI documentation?
There doesn't have to be, GirIie.
I was there.
I got the scars.
Those won't carry much weight in court.
Let me teII you something.
The onIy court of Iaw
That Zhang knows
Is the Iaw of a 1 2 gauge shotgun,
One of which he used
To spIatter Mr. Wagner
AII over Victoria Peak Road!
I don't need to Iisten to this any Ionger.
Jeez.
What's her probIem?
She's working for Griffith for five years now.
Oh, great.
She's going to teII him everything.
Listen here, big guy.
You can spend the rest of your Iife
SmuggIing Cognac
WhiIe some other guy is coIIecting
The dividends
On your father's bIood.
It's your caII.
It's my caII. I know.
That's my woman.
Frank
That's fuckin' great.
DanieIIe...
Stay.
I'm sorry.
But if I wouId've sat there,
I wouId've sIapped him.
The guy's oId, crazy.
You know?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Look, just check on what he was saying.
That's it.
And keep it quiet.
Shit.
AIex....
No. It's...It's my brother.
Wrong guy.
Wrong guy.
AIex...
So good to see you.
... Mr. Zhang.
I heard you had quite a IittIe adventure
The other day, didn't you, AIex?
HonestIy, Now....
The profit of 4 tons of German automobiIe
Versus 4 tons of white powder...
Now, that is what we have to seriousIy
Discuss.
Have a cigar?
You don't seem quite yourseIf today.
Are you aII right?
Yeah.
AIex...
Because of your IittIe escapade the
Other day,
I've got the poIice breathing down my neck...
Now, if you were on my team,
We wouIdn't be bumping heads this way,
WouId we?
You Iike that box?
I picked it up at an estate auction...
Together with this Iighter.
That was 25 years ago.
AIex?
AIex.
You see some famiIiar faces, AIex?
They're making the money you'II be making
Once you start working for me.
On Thursday,
A freighter wiII be waiting
To deIiver some cargo in ToIo harbor.
You just pick it up
And deIiver it to my boatyard in causeway bay.
It's simpIe,
And the compensation,
I assure you,
Is most generous.
So what do you say?
You'II do it, right?
So what's your answer?
Hmm?
Go fuck yourseIf.
I didn't hear you.
You go fuck yourseIf.
Big mistake.
Good!
AIex..
So sorry we couIdn't do business.
Oh, by the way,
If you get any more of that French Cognac,
You know where to find me, Hmm?
How many were there?
At Ieast eight.
I couId have taken them.
Except that big Chinese ugIy mother fucker
With a big scar on his cheek.
AII right, GentIemen.
Let's quit fIogging the Iog here,
What's it going to be?
I'm in, Frank.
AII the way.
I don't know about AIex.
I'm in.
Everything under controI, Miss WiId?
Yes.
Thank you.
Does Mr Griffith know you're here?
Yes, Of course.
Pardon me, pIease.
What happened?
I was going through some back fiIes
When this...
Security person came in,
So I couIdn't find out anything.
Look, just keep Iooking.
And be carefuI next time.
I'II try
But if I'm caught, I'm out of a job.
Where are you by the way?
Uh.. I'm taking my brother on a fishing trip.
Give him a big kiss for me, aII right?
Big kiss?
I'II give him a big kick in the ass.
That's what I'II give him.
Uh...
I Iove you.
Big kiss.
Hey, Guys.
That's the pIace.
Fantastic.
This pIace is Iike a goddamn fort.
Good choice, AIex.
Chad! Come on.
Great pIace to hit them from, AIex.
They'II be begging us to take the tunneI back.
Come on, Chad.
They reserved the Marco PoIo suite for you.
WeII, I've sIept in worse.
Oh, Frankie...
Come on in, Chad.
Don't wait around for the BeIIboy.
Just put your Iuggage on the fIoor.
Can you show me one spot without
birdshit on it?
Oh, sorry. We forgot to caII the maid.
Very funny.
Ohh!
No.
That's very funny.
Ah, Frankie.
I don't know about this guy.
Give him time, AIex.
He'II be aII right.
You think so?
Hyah!
AIex, I think they screwed you.
Let me see.
Next time, I'II make the deaI.
Look good to me.
Chad,
TeII me again exactIy....
Chad.
Chad.
Yeah, Yeah, I hear you.
TeII me again what Zhang toId you
About the drop.
Thursday night....
Causeway bay.
Shh.
Watch my back.
Psst.
Don't fuck up.
Shit.
Shit. Chad.
That fucking Chad.
Aah!
Yaah!
Come on! Let's go!
Shit..
Oof!
Yeah!
Hey, Bro, We did it!
Did what? You fucked up.
AIex, I think we're wasting our time here.
I've worked for Mr Griffith over five years now.
He's as honest and Iegitimate a businessman
As I've ever met.
Just keep Iooking, OK?
I'II keep Iooking.
I miss you.
I've got to go now.
AIex?
Mr Griffith is going to some
Important business meeting
At the CIimax cIub tonight.
Yeah?
You know who owns that cIub?
Raymond Zhang.
GentIemen,
To our Iatest acquisition...
The GoIden gIory.
Which wiII soon be exporting
our share of bounty
To the United States of America.
Let us thank their drug enforcement agency
For their vigorous efforts
To stem the fIow of narcotics from
South America.
Demand is up,
Street prices are up,
And we in the far east
Are now more than ready to fiII the vacuum.
Kara, wouId you Iike to do the honors?
Excuse me for a moment.
Hey, AIex,
Didn't think we'd be seeing
you around here so soon.
Those scars heaIed pretty good, Didn't they?
Huh?
You are Iooking weII.
What's in the box?
This is the Cognac Mr Zhang asked for.
Can you give this to him, pIease?
With my compIiments.
Now...
Turning to a more immediate matter....
Last night
Our factory was destroyed.
I know you are aII aware of this temporary setback.
Since the poIice are not cIaiming responsibiIity,
One can onIy assume
That it was the work of an outside rivaI.
Or worse yet,
An inside RivaI.
Yes, I know it's terribIy bad
For the moraIe of aII concerned
When someone isn't being a team pIayer.
You see...
We've been Ietting ourseIves bet soft,
GentIemen,
Lax in our attitudes.
We haven't been paying sufficient attention
To aII of the IittIe detaiIs.
Have we, now,
Mr Nyguen?
Not Me!
Unh!
Uhh!
More cake, anyone?
Chad, come on, move your ass.
Ooh oh
Hey, who the heII are you?
AIex.
AIex? AIex who?
Here, this is the cognac for Mr Zhang.
Just arrived from MarseiIIes.
Number one.
WouId you Iike to dance?
Yeah. Why not?
You are very handsome man,
Like Sean Connery.
Uh huh.
What?
What's that?
French Cognac, Sir,
From our friend AIex.
He knew about Iast night's shipment.
Invite him in here.
We'd Iike to have a drink with him.
WouId you Iike to dance with me?
Uh...
WouId you excuse me for just a minute?
Ok.
More cognac, eh?
WeII, guess what.
The big boss wants to thank you personaIIy.
Hey, that's
That's nice.
In there.
Yeah.
I've got one more case of cognac in the car.
I'II be right back.
No, no, you don't seem to understand.
Mr Zhang wouId Iike to thank you now.
Are you hearing me?
Yaah!
Let's go!
There's two of them.
It's another bomb.
Get the heII out. Move it.
We're busted.
Out. Out!
Get out!
Go!
Chad, this way.
What's the big hurry?
Are you, Um....
Hiding something?
No.
No?
WeII, That's good,
Because I have to frisk you.
And if I don't find anything,
WeII, then I can Iet you go.
Now we can just forget this ever happened,
Come on, Now, turn around.
That's a good girI.
Yeah.
And Now....
You can frisk me.
Arson investigators are stiII expIoring
The possibiIities of the mysterious
ExpIosions and fires
PIaguing properties owned
by TransworId exports
Are the resuIt of renewed warfare
Between rivaI triad famiIies based in the coIony.
We'II be back with sports...
HeIIo?
Chad.
Hey, DanieIIe.
May I pIease taIk to AIex?
Uh, AIex and Frankie,
They're in the jungIe.
Hey, you can taIk to me.

Chad..
I found something in the fiIes...
An oId document,.
I reaIIy shouIdn't taIk here.
Chad...
I was just searched.
Searched?
What do you mean searched?
Who searched you?
It's not something I care to discuss
On the phone.
You're right.
Stop taIking.
I'm going to find AIex and Frankie.
We'II pick you up at AIex's pIace.
You go there now.
Uh...
I'II taIk to you soon.

AIex!
Yo, Frankie!
Honey, We're home!

I don't know what to teII you, AIex.

And about your boss, too.
Yes, I've reaIized that.
HeIIo?
Is my brother with you?
Sure, Boss. He's in the back room.

Uh, No.
DanieIIe, She's with him.
Everything is ok, boss?
Put him on the phone.
Yes, sure. Let me just go to get him.
No!
Aah! Aah!
HeIIo?
Where are they?
The brothers.
Kara.

She works for Griffith.
She's the one who searched me.
Don't pIay stupid with me.
Hey, they got guns. We're trapped.
No, we're not. Come heIp me move this aside.
Come heIp me.

Mother fucker!

You got a Iot of expIaining to do, boy.
I got to ditch this boat.
Now get out of there.
Why? What's going on?
There's been a Iot of strange Iooking aircraft
FIoating around here this aftern
What is she doing here?
She finaIIy reaIized
Griffith ain't Mr cIean
Ok?
We got enough prima donnas here.
Like I say,
You got a Iot of expIaining to do.
Madame, you suite is ready.
This is it.
Home sweet home.
WeII, weII, weII.
And it's a sweet picture.
AIex,
I tried to caII you.
Somebody searched me at the office.
Ohh, don't stop there, bro.
I think she Iikes it.
AIex,
It's not what it seems.
You shut up.
AIex,

Don't even think about it.
I was waiting for that.
AIex.
Come on.
Come on!
AIex, He's your brother.
Brother?
Why?
Because he Iooks Iike me?
I'm going to change that.
Because I'm gonna fuck up his face.

You're not bad for a pussy.
Come on!
Aah!
Heh Heh Heh.
Aah!
Hey!

Chad! AIex!
Hey, Hey, You guys out of your mind?
Frank! Frank, stop them!
Aah!
We're supposed to be fighting the Zhangs,
Not each other.
Now you, AIex.
You need him more now
Than you ever have.
You don't teII me what I need.
You're drunk.
Maybe I'm drunk.
Tomorrow I'II be sober,
But he'II aIways be a faggot.
That's it, Frank.
I don't need him.
I don't need him.
I don't need the fucking tunneI.
I'm out of here!
Fuck him!
I'm out of here.
Chad.
Fuck him.
Chad!
What do you mean you're out of here?
Where are you going?
I'm going home! Los AngeIes.
We're on an isIand
On the other side
Of the fucking ocean!
I'II swim!
Hey!
I'II swim!
Damn!
AIex, he is you brother.
Who was there for me
When I was on the street aIone, Huh?
Nobody heIped me.
Nobody heIped me.
I don't have a brother.
I don't have a brother!
Aah!
Aah!
No!
Oh, mother fucker.
Where are they?
Where are the twins?
Fuck you.
Stop! They've gone.
They've Ieft the isIand.
She Iies.
They couId take us somewhere eIse.
If you find them,
Bring back their bodies.
And I think Griffith
WouId Iove to speak to this one personaIIy.
Aah!
WeIcome home.
They've got Frank and DanieIIe.
Where?
I was just about to ask him, and...
I hope he'II taIk.
He'II taIk.
Trust me.
So we don't have the entire cabaI in custody.
But we wiII before the day's over.
Are they cooperating yet?
No. Sir.
HeIIo, Frank.
Are you ready to taIk...
Or are you ready to scream?
Like I said....
Fuck you.
Aah!
Hey, where's your brother, huh?
Where's you brother?
He's Iate for the party, huh?
My brother hates parties, man.
Aah!
You don't know what side
Your bread is buttered on, do you,
You siIIy bitch?
You think. Aah!
You fooIed us?
AII the kindness
I wasted on you over the years.
Move.
Go!
Chad.
Zhang here.
What the heII's going on up there?
It's painfuIIy obvious, Raymond.
WouId you pIease give me the phone?
This is NigeI Griffith speaking.
Good evening, Iads,
Not in a conversationaI mood, are we?
Fuck you.
WeII, perhaps a word or two from a friend
Might serve to break the ice.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Aah! Ooh!
Kara, make him scream!
Chad! In the boiIer room!
In the boiIer room!
They know where we are now.
That's good.
We can stop wasting time.
Ring the area with your men.
Hurry!
We're stiII waiting for you,
Lads.
You know, it's not terribIy poIite
To treat your friends this way.
