Welcome to Miami.
While in the airport, please
observe Florida laws...
... which prohibit smoking
in the terminal.
Thank you for not smoking.
Your son-in-law dealt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.
He saw that woman every night.
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.
It's unpIeasant, I know.
Discreet, isn't he?
What an imbeciIe!
I tried to warn my daughter,
but what can you do?
I worry about the chiIdren.
My invoice is in the enveIope,
if that's aII.
Yes, Mr. WeIIes. Thank you.
Senator, Iet me know if I can be
of further assistance to you.
I'II be in touch.
HeIIo?
You're home.
We're back here.
How did it go?
I think very weII.
Good.
Daddy's home, sweetie.
How's the textbook business?
I got 10,000 words on
the FederaI Theatre project.
It shouId be 4000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.
So, kind of bad.
How was Miami?
Fine. Lonesome.
CouIdn't pay me enough
to Iive down there.
Then why'd you go?
Senator MichaeIson
has powerfuI friends.
HeIIo, CindereIIa.
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.
Oh, that's my girI.
She missed you.
I missed you.
You been smoking?
Smoking? I'm not smoking.
Come on, honey.
You reek of it.
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars foIIowing this guy.
Is this the first thing I get?
-You're accusing me?
-I'm not accusing you.
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been aII through that.
I'II make dinner.
Are you hungry?
You're cooking?
I missed you.
I don't Iike it when you Ieave.
ShouId I go?
I'm going to do it.
Come on.
What's aII the troubIe, CindereIIa?
There, there.
I Iove you.
I Iove you.
Honey, phone!
Okay, I've got it!
Sorry, I was just switching phones.
It's a pIeasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. LongdaIe.
How can I be of assistance to you?
Four o'cIock wouId be fine.
I think I know where it is.
DanieI LongdaIe.
We spoke on the phone.
PIeasure.
I'm the Christians' attorney and
an executor of the estate.
This is Mrs. Christian.
An honour to meet you.
You come highIy
recommended, Mr. WeIIes.
I've spoken to associates of mine in
Harrisburg, Lancaster and Hershey.
You have infIuentiaI friends.
I've been priviIeged to provide
services for peopIe I admire.
You were praised
for your discretion...
...your strict adherence
to confidentiaIity.
Thank you.
As you know,
my husband passed away recentIy.
My condoIences, Mrs. Christian.
His passing has Ieft me
with something of a diIemma.
I'II do whatever I can to heIp.
My husband's inner sanctum.
Not many peopIe have been
inside this room.
My father worked the Pittsburgh miII.
Irving United SteeI, I beIieve.
But you attended Penn
on an academic schoIarship.
That's right.
Peers went into Iaw and finance.
You chose surveiIIance.
I decided it was the future.
Your husband is a Iegend.
PIease.
We were married 45 years.
Four chiIdren, seven grandchiIdren.
But his true passion Iay...
...in his work.
But he was aIways IoyaI.
I Ioved him deepIy.
I understand.
DanieI.
My husband was the onIy one
with the combination to this safe.
We hired somebody to open it.
I prevented anyone...
...from seeing the contents.
I feIt these were
my husband's private things.
I didn't....
I didn't reaIize....
Do you want to teII me
what you found?
Cash, stock certificates.
Nothing out of the ordinary,
reaIIy, except that.
It's a fiIm...
...where a girI appears to be murdered.
I'm not sure I understand.
It's very reaIistic.
But how many peopIe seem to be
reaIisticaIIy kiIIed...
...in movies and on TV every day?
It begins as a reIativeIy
sIeazy bit of pornography...
...and rapidIy turns
quite vioIent and bIoody.
What you're taIking about
is caIIed a snuff fiIm.
Snuff fiIms are a kind of urban myth.
Sex industry foIkIore.
There's no such thing.
That's what I expIained
to Mrs. Christian.
This is probabIy
an S & M fiIm of some sort.
SimuIated rape, simuIated vioIence.
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.
Fake bIood, speciaI effects.
WouId you Iook at the fiIm
and give us your opinion?
AII I want...
...is to know that
this atrocity is faIse.
I want the proof.
WeII...
...whoever made the fiIm
was adept at authenticity.
But I'm no expert.
Let the poIice make a determination.
Out of the question.
That'd be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...
...not the Ieast of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.
Find out who made this fiIm...
...and estabIish whether it's reaI.
You can name your price.
You'II be provided with
whatever you need to buy information.
GirI's aII I've got to go on.
I couId treat it
Iike a missing persons case.
Understood.
Of course...
...we need to be assured
that you wouId not copy this fiIm.
You have my word on that.
But I'II be deaIing
directIy with you...
...and onIy you.
Your reIationship with
your attorney is your own.
-No offense.
-None taken.
I reaIize you've given this
carefuI consideration.
You couId have destroyed it.
TeII me the poor girI wasn't kiIIed.
PIease?
Find her aIive.
I'II do the best I can, ma'am.
Cleveland?
You just got home.
I wish I couId stay,
but this is the mortgage.
It's Cindy's coIIege money.
If I do right by her,
with the circIe she runs in...
...this couId be a big break.
Do we need a break?
Your father thinks we do.
So, what was Mrs. Christian Iike?
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feeI sorry for her.
It's a missing persons.
I toId her I'd give it
a coupIe of weeks. Three.
It can't take Ionger than that.
It's an outside shot.
That's aII I can teII you.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.
It's aIways that way.
-She's awake. I'II get her.
-I'II be up in a sec.
-You're taking the gun?
-I won't need it.
Don't take it.
I won't wear it.
It's a precaution. Don't worry.
WiII you caII me
when you get there, pIease?
/'ve been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...
...a runaway, about 18, maybe.
They buy her a meal.
The doctor tries to convince her...
... that, at least,
she should call home.
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself. ..
...that was the Iast they saw of her.
We had a friend of mine
at the department work up a sketch.
They want to see
if I can I.D. this girI...
...then pass aIong
a message to the parents...
...Ietting them know
the kid's aIive.
You don't mind if I run a check?
Go ahead.
You want it, you got it.
Knock yourseIf out.
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1,000,000
missing every year.
We got as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.
Files are by state
and year of disappearance.
Children are separate.
No eating or smoking.
-There's coffee.
-Any good?
Horrible.
/t'll be your best friend
after a few days...
... if you last that long.
Good luck.
Honey, it's me.
How are you?
/'m good.
Where are you?
/'m still in Cleveland.
How's Cindy?
She's sweet.
She's sleeping.
-/'m missing you bigtime.
-Yeah, / miss you too.
/'ll call you tomorrow night.
Good night.
Good night, sweetheart.
Hello, Mrs. Christian?
Tom Welles.
Here's where we stand.
/ checked the film stock.
/t's called Supralux 5-4-4.
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.
So the fiIm was made prior to that?
Yes. I'm probabIy being
overIy thorough with this...
...but you might dig up your husband's
financiaI records...
...about 6 or 7 years ago.
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.
This isn't a movie you drop off
at the one-hour photo.
So you think it's one of a kind.
The film is what we've got.
There's no negative.
Unlike video, it's not
designed to be duplicated.
Whatever this is,
/ have a feeling...
... there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.
/'m looking for a girl
we're not even sure is missing.
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...
... finding the guys who made this film
is going to be very difficult.
/ know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.
/ will. /'ll keep trying for you.
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.
We can't come to the phone now,
so please leave a message at the beep.
Honey, it's me.
I'm sorry I forgot
to caII Iast night.
I won't forget tonight.
I've been gone a Iong time.
I hope I'II be home soon.
I Iove you, and I miss you.
We'II taIk tonight.
You Iooking for Janet?
HeIIo, Mrs. Mathews?
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a Iicensed investigator.
I've been hired by the U.S. Resource
Centre, Missing Persons...
...as part of an internaI audit.
I'd Iike you to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent....
NeiI. NeiI CoIe?
Yes, Agent CoIe. He toId me
he'd caII and Iet you know to expect me.
He didn't caII?
Is this you?
You Iook about five years oId.
A IittIe oIder.
Sweet.
It's important that you don't
Iet this raise your expectations.
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.
AII I'm saying is, pIease know...
...I'm not here to create
any faIse hope.
We fought aII the time,
Mary Anne and me...
...and her stepdad.
She hated him...
...because he wasn't her reaI dad.
TroubIe here, troubIe at schooI.
TroubIe.
Didn't Iike ruIes.
Takes after me, I guess.
I had to Iearn the hard way.
Can I speak to your husband?
Her stepfather?
Dave?
Gone.
Two years after Mary Anne Ieft.
AII the time, she resented him.
I Iost her because of him,
and then I Iost him.
I'm the onIy one stiII here.
Did Mary have a boyfriend?
She was sneaking out with someone.
She wouIdn't teII me who.
Coming home with hickeys,
Iying aII the time.
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...
...with the stepfather...
...were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?
There was nothing Iike that.
The poIice and FBI asked.
There wasn't anything Iike that.
She'd have toId me.
I apoIogize. I had to ask.
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.
They'II be waiting for her
when she comes back.
It's because I sIapped her.
I know.
We was fighting about Dave,
and she was just pushing my buttons.
And I sIapped her.
Jesus!
Next day, she was gone.
When kids run, they
aImost aIways Ieave a note.
It's guiIt, usuaIIy.
There wasn't one.
PoIice Iooked.
An abduction's one thing,
a runaway's another.
Sometimes it's not the priority
for the poIice it shouId be.
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?
You're probabIy right,
but wouId you Iet me Iook?
You teII me...
...not to get my hopes up...
...not to raise my expectations.
Go ahead.
I need a drink.
Thank you.
Dear Mom,
if you're reading this...
... it means / called you
from Hollywood, California.
/ left my diary behind because
/ want you to see why /'m leaving.
/t's not because you hit me.
/ hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.
Warren Anderson and me
are in love.
/'m going to start
a new life with him.
His dad owns
that garage in town.
But Warren has even bigger plans.
He'll become a star
in action movies.
He says /'m prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.
/ could be a star too.
You want a drink?
When we cruise into Hollywood...
.../'ll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because / am in love.
You were right.
I didn't find anything.
Fixed you a drink.
Thanks, no.
I've got work to do.
I'II stop by tomorrow night.
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.
Don't come looking for me,
because /'m not coming back.
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TV or in magazines.
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.
Mr. Anderson?
Who's asking?
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.
I'm Iooking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?
Sure.
What's it about? You a cop?
No, sir.
Just a friend from a whiIe back.
Owe him some money.
You owe him money?
That's a new one.
You can Ieave it
right here if you want.
If it's aII the same,
I'd Iike to send it to him.
CaIifornia, right?
CaIifornia?
Son, you know where
the FayetteviIIe Iockup is?
That's where Warren is.
Doing eight months on a B and E.
Thank you.
Yeah, man, I knew her.
Dumped that bitch right
before I moved to L.A.
She shows up knocking at my door
Iike a fucking staIker.
ToId that bitch she couId go to heII.
Where'd she go?
HeII, maybe.
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck, either.
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.
Ask me, her tits
weren't aII that great.
Did you hear from her again?
Because I fucked her
doesn't mean I wanted her there.
She came to HoIIywood to be
a big fucking movie star.
And so did I.
Check me out now.
Why don't you pass me
one of them smokes?
I don't smoke.
How you doing?
/'m okay.
You don't sound okay.
It's not easy.
Why? What's going on?
It's just tougher than
I thought it wouId be.
Is it getting to you?
/ got a lead / can't drop.
I'm aImost done.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
I Iove you.
Give Cindy a kiss for me.
Wait, I think she wants to say bye.
Say bye to Daddy.
Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.
Hi, Cinderella.
She's touching the phone.
You shouId see her face
at your voice.
I Iove you.
I Iove you too. Bye.
I was just making dinner.
I've made enough for two,
as it happens.
I'm sorry, I can't stay.
I wanted to Iet you know
I spoke to my peopIe at the agency.
I toId them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.
WeII...
...stay for a drink, at Ieast.
You sure you're not hungry?
It'd be nice to have a meaI
without the TV on for once.
I have a Iong drive ahead of me.
It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating aIone.
I don't know why. You think
I'd be used to it by now.
Mrs. Mathews?
Janet.
Do you ever consider....
Do you reaIize that
Mary may never come back?
I think about it every day.
Every time the phone rings...
...every time, I stiII think it's her.
She's aII I think about.
Can you teII me...
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...
...Iiving a good Iife, being happy...
...but you don't know...
...you never find out...
...or the worst being true...
...her being gone...
...but you know.
You finaIIy know...
...what's happened to her.
What wouId I choose?
Yes.
I wouId choose to know.
I need to know.
Excuse me,
I have to use your restroom.
You're Ieaving.
I'II caII you if I find anything out.
How you doing?
Big date tonight?
Yeah, guess so.
CouId I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?
It's tempting, but no thanks.
I'd hate to see you in one
of those everyday situations...
...that caIIs for it
and you don't have one.
I'II risk it.
AII right, your totaI
is $74.58, pIease.
A hundred.
TotaI's $25 and some change.
Thank you for shopping
at AduIt Bookstore.
And have yourseIf a fabuIous day.
What are you reading?
Catchy titIe.
What are you reaIIy reading?
Hard to beIieve it's got
any parts worth highIighting.
Capote.
You know how it is.
WouIdn't want to embarrass yourseIf
in front of your feIIow perverts.
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.
Where wouId I be then?
Have a good day.
How are you?
Hey, honey.
-How you doing?
-/'m a little beat.
How's Cindy?
She's sweet. She misses you.
How's it going?
The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.
ReaIIy?
Honey, wait.
Can I caII you back?
/'ll call you right back, / promise.
Bye, honey.
Mrs. Christian, there were three men.
Not just the cameraman
and the masked man.
/ caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.
/'ll get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not--
All right, /'ll keep trying.
Thank you, / appreciate
your support. Goodbye.
What we have here is
137 biIIabIe man-hours...
...a hundred-pIus thousand
doIIars machine...
...and the resuIt is an enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.
Want it framed?
There you go. Have a nice day.
It's Iike a gas station,
you pay before you pump.
Remember me?
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after aII.
I need information.
Maybe you can heIp.
Thomas WeIIes. Nice picture.
What sort of information?
I got aII different kinds.
The kind I'II pay for.
I don't know
what you're Iooking for...
...so we're cIear from the start,
I'm straight.
CongratuIations.
Thank you.
Zip it!
I can hook you up.
Name the vice,
I name the price.
-How Iong you been working here?
-AImost two years.
What's your name,
if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Here's the deaI.
This thing has to do
with underground pornography.
Stuff that's soId
under the counter, iIIegaIIy.
There's not much iIIegaI out there.
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good Iook.
If you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.
You're not a cop, are you?
If I ask and you are,
you got to teII me.
I'm not a cop.
A private detective?
Like Shaft?
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on saIe.
How much you make in there?
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.
Let's pretend I Iive
in the same fantasy worId...
...where you make $400
a week in that dump.
I'II give you 500 for a few days.
Six sounds good, Pops.
Five.
Here's my number.
When can you start?
WeII, tomorrow night I get off Iate.
Tomorrow.
AII right.
And don't caII me Pops.
Of course not. I wouIdn't
want to hurt your feeIings.
/ don't know what your scene is.
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.
You don't look like your average
sleaze. More like your average cop.
So when you ask people
about fucking illegal stuff. ..
...it has a certain patina to it.
Patina.
It's a Truman Capote word. HeIIo?
If someone never soId a snuff fiIm,
they shouIdn't care what I ask.
If they have,
they shouId be nervous.
Whoever acts insuIted,
knock on their door.
Look, Pops, it's not too Iate
to change your mind about aII this.
There's things you'II see
that you can't unsee.
-They stay in your head.
-How do you know what I've seen?
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their Iimit.
I've been here six fucking years
trying to get my music together.
So I start part-time
where I work, to make ends meet.
And boom, a coupIe years go by,
and here I am.
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.
Don't worry about me.
But thank you.
You're weIcome.
Pops, you dance with the deviI,
the deviI don't change.
DeviI changes you.
Some of your Iyrics?
That's cute.
This pIace has been around
about 3 years...
...but they keep moving it
house to house.
This is the tip of the iceberg.
Lots of Mexican S & M,
Iots of Asian bondage...
...aII kinds of bestiaIity,
if you're into that.
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, teII FriendIy.
Ask him.
Don't do that!
AII right! It's cooI!
AII right? Okay.
Come on, Iet's go. AII right!
Are you affiIiated with Iaw enforcement?
Fuck you, Larry.
Are you a Iaw enforcement agent,
or affiIiated with Iaw enforcement?
Fuck you, Larry.
You're getting cooI there, WeIIes.
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.
But these saIes
won't Iast much Ionger.
It's risky,
and everything's on the Net.
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.
Then there's cIassified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...
...wires through dummy corporations.
If something's iIIegaI, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?
How's it going, SamueI?
I'II say hi to her.
How are you? I Iove that.
It's the MichaeI Jackson Iook,
with the zippers.
What are these?
Extreme bondage.
Rape fiIms.
Sick shit.
Buy five, get one for free.
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
There's no such thing as snuff.
What you see is what I got, mister.
Do you know where I can get some?
Fuck off.
There she is.
There she is.
It's DoubIe SIap Dorothy.
That chick couId be
a basebaII pIayer.
The swing on her is unreaI.
Some of these S & M and bondage fiIms
you'II see straddIe the Iine.
Foot fetish, orgies, shit fiIms...
...hermaphrodites, mutiIation.
It's harder than hard-core.
But mostIy IegaI.
Stick.
One guy sees it and pukes.
Another guy sees it
and he faIIs in Iove.
This is the guy I toId you about.
Got the tapes?
$1000.
-1200 for the two.
-You toId Max 1000.
I know. This is more fun. I raise
the price, you get pissed off.
-I thought we had a reIationship.
-Is it reaI?
Sickest shit you'II ever see.
Is that reaI?
That sure as shit Iooks reaI.
She's not breathing.
Who makes these fiIms?
I don't know.
Looks Iike the PhiIippines.
Yeah, definiteIy the PhiIippines.
Wait a minute.
That's the same girI.
Isn't that the same girI?
Look.
It is the same.
They're fakes.
That's great.
Snuff 2.: The Resurrection.
Oh, boy.
WeII, what do you expect for 1200?
You want a beer or something?
I couId use anything.
But I'm sorry, man.
I toId you snuff was bogus.
I just wish I wouId have
gotten you a receipt.
'' Hard Spank.''
'' Max CaIifornia.''
That's my oId band.
We broke up.
When?
Maybe about a year ago.
I don't mean any offense...
...but what are you doing
mixed up in aII this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something eIse.
Thanks.
I wish you owned a record IabeI.
Look, it beats pumping gas.
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.
I just point the way.
You said it gets to you.
WeII, heII, yeah.
Parade of Iosers I see every day?
What choices have I got?
The music industry is not exactIy
beating down my door.
And what about you, Tom WeIIes?
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?
A daughter.
So you got a wife and a daughter...
...and a nice IittIe yeIIow house...
...and a dog named Shep.
What the heII are you doing here?
Good question.
Do you get turned on
at pIaces Iike tonight?
No, I am not.
You don't exactIy
get turned off, either.
DeviI's changing you aIready.
Good night, Max.
This gentIeman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girI.
Yes.
I remember Mary.
Mary Anne Mathews?
She Iived here for onIy about a month,
if I recaII correctIy.
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?
Not yet, but I'm Iooking
into it for her parents.
CouId you get
that fIowered one down for me?
That's her suitcase.
I'd forgotten about it
tiII you showed me her picture.
I suppose I aIways
hoped she'd be back.
She seemed so Iost.
After a time, aII I couId do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.
Can you get this suitcase
to her peopIe?
If it's appropriate.
Yes, of course. Thank you.

Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.

What city and listing?
/ don't know. Hollywood.
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and / need an address.
Please hold for
phone number and address.
-I was here first.
-Sorry, I'II just be a coupIe minutes.
Eddie PooIe?
A process server?
No, I've been inquiring around if,
by any chance, you've seen this girI.
You a cop?
I'm a member of her famiIy.
You know how much pussy
comes through here?
PIease, if you'd just take a Iook.
It wouId've been a few years.
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.
Never seen her.
You sure?
I just Iooked
at the picture, didn't I?
Come on. I got
a Iot of shit to do.
Who's next?
This'II be fine.
What kind of shit are you peddling?
My tapes sell.
People eat the shit up.
/ had three jerks
returning your tapes last month.
You know how bad it has to be
for a jackass to come back...
... with a receipt
and try to fucking return it?
How bad?
Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.
Till then, fuck you!
Does your mother have any teeth?
/f she does,
send her down, you fuck.
He's not answering.
Hey, boss.
There's a case of beer in there.
-How was your day?
-Great.
-Everybody here?
-Everybody but one of the chicks.
Been watching them?
Celebrity Films.
I know aII about it.
Yeah, you know about what?
About that girI...
...six years ago.
I know what you did to her.
Who is this?
You murdered her.
You and your friends.
What the fuck are
you talking about?
You kiIIed her on fiIm.
Now you're fucked.
You're aII fucked.
Come on.
Come on, give me something, Eddie.
/t's me.
What do you want?
/ just got a call.
We got to talk.
And not on the phone.
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.
Fuck! Fuck!
So you Iike to watch, paranoid fuck.
Phone is listed under ''D. Velvet''
in Manhattan.
Dino VeIvet.
He's a producer/director/weirdo.
He's Iike the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.
How hard is his stuff?
How hard do you want it?
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.
DefiniteIy not for the squeamish.
Kind of hard to come by.
MostIy out of the back
of bondage magazines.
But he's got fans.
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.
He's toId me VeIvet wiII do
commissions if there's enough dough.
Nothing iIIegaI, but borderIine.
If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit--
I got the picture.
Max, get in here!
So...
...you're going to New York?
Maybe.
Looking Iike that.
You'II need me.
This Frenchie guy is more
than just a fan of VeIvet fiIms.
I can get you in if you want.
For more money, of course.
PIus expenses. I fIy first cIass.
So when are we Ieaving?
What are you doing?
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad AppIe.
I toId you, don't fiIm me.
Fine, Howard Hughes.
You didn't say it'd be this Iuxurious.
-It's the PresidentiaI suite.
-A comforting sense of humour.
I'II be a coupIe of doors down.
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fIeabag.
PeopIe mind their own
business in fIeabags.
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever VeIvet tapes you can find.
Get receipts.
Yes, sir.
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.
Between November...
...of 1992...
...and March...
...of 1993...
...he wrote one check out
to cash from each account.
My husband never dealt
with money personally.
Certainly not cash.
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.
When totaIIed together,
the five checks...
...from the five different accounts,
they equaI $1 miIIion.
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.
I onIy mentioned this because...
...you asked me to Iook
for anything unusuaI.
I've got about $5000 Ieft in cash.
I'II need another 50, if you approve
the pIan I mentioned earIier.
I'm very cIose to identifying
the man in the mask.
I'II have Mr. LongdaIe arrange it.
How will / get it to you?
I'II give you the address.
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.
Who is this?
In the mask, who is he?
Come on, wake up.
Who is this?
One of Dino's Iunatics.
He's in a bunch of these.
What's his name?
I don't know.
That's his whoIe thing.
He aIways wears a mask.
He caIIs himseIf Machete--
No, Machine.
He caIIs himseIf Machine.
He's a Iover, man.
DefiniteIy Ioves
what he does for a Iiving.
Can't say the same about you.
Yes, yes.
You can see they reaIIy
appreciate my styIe here.
I'm not the kind to bIend in
with the crowd, if you didn't notice.
Like these Iadies here,
they Iike my styIe.
Who is it?
This is Max CaIifornia.
I caIIed earIier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's, from L.A.
My partner and I wouId Iike
to speak to Mr. VeIvet.
He's not here.
We have to give him
a Iarge sum of money.
If he's not interested, we'II spIit.
What are you taIking about?
Can't you just answer
my simpIe question?
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!
I've been asking you that
the Iast 10 minutes.
Sit down.
Make yourseIf comfortabIe.
You idiot!
Going to shoot in two days?
Man, you're spending my money.
Yeah, you better do that.
Fucking asshoIe!
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.
God!
So, what can I do you for?
We'd Iike to commission a fiIm.
A Dino VeIvet originaI, one of a kind.
That's right.
I'm a huge admirer of yours.
God, I Iove fIattery.
You're a genius, Mr. VeIvet.
A goddamn genius.
The onIy one stiII transferring
fiIm to video.
Nobody reaIIy appreciates
that kind of integrity anymore.
The grain and the gritty Iook you get.
Which is your favourite?
If I had to choose, it'd either be
Choke or Devil.
The subIiminaI imagery in Choke
is what gets under your skin.
WeII, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.
What kind of a budget
are we taIking about?
Five thousand now.
Five thousand upon deIivery.
Two women. One white, one bIack.
Hard bondage, of course.
Other than that, trusting...
...your artistic interpretation...
...I onIy have two stipuIations.
ChaIIenge me.
I want to watch you work.
You don't want a franchise, do you?
SteaI the recipe for my secret...
...hot sauce?
No.
That's good.
I appreciate that.
Second stipuIation.
The other performer...
...has to be...
...that animaI you use.
The man in the mask.
Machine.
I don't know.
He might be interested.
But I think it'II cost you another...
...five to seven grand.
I can arrange something
reaIIy speciaI for ten.
You can do that.
Good enough for me.
I'II just have to put
my thinking cap on.
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.
You make sure you caII me
after 10 o'cIock tonight.
10 o'cIock.
You know, you have a very speciaI,
very beautifuI face.
The way Iight hits it.
I'd Iike to shoot you.
You don't mind?
I'm camera-shy.
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?
Those are two different
kinds of trust.
I hope we can do business.
Hoyt Avenue, BrookIyn, 3 o'cIock.
I'II be there.
I got something to tend to. Thanks.
So are we in the movie business?
That's for you.
-What is it?
-Money.
PeopIe use it to purchase goods.
That's awfuIIy generous and everything--
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deaI.
There's a pIane ticket for the fIight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.
This is as far as I want you to go.
What are you taIking about?
We're a team.
We're partners.
Max, I'm sure you reaIize
these peopIe we're deaIing with...
...are extremeIy disturbed.
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.
You did a great job.
It's time for you to go home.
But this is, Iike, our big case.
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?
Okay, what?
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff fiIm, right?
I can't figure out why you're invoIved.
Maybe the victim--?
First, who said you're right?
Second, who said
anything about a victim?
OnIy 3 ruIes in Iife, Tom WeIIes.
One, there's aIways a victim.
And two, don't be it.
And three?
I forgot three.
Good, I want you to forget everything.
I want you to get on a pIane to L.A.
and forget it aII.
I get caIIs for work on the West Coast.
I'd Iike to caII you again.
You're going to Iook me up
and caII me?
I couId use your heIp. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.
I'm not patronizing you.
WeII, thanks.
AII right.
You take care, Max CaIifornia.
AII right, Tom WeIIes.
DeviI's waiting on you.
There you are.
Come and join us.
HeIIo, Machine.
Love your work.
Did you bring the money?
It's right here.
Good.
Where are the women?
Women...
...they're aIways Iate.
What are these for?
They're just props.
Nice, aren't they?
Machine and I were just taIking
about the beauty of knives.
My guests have arrived!
Mr. W., wouId you be so kind as
to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you doing?
I hate to repeat myseIf.
It makes me Iook so stupid.
SIowIy.
PIease, show me your gun.
Nice and easy!
That's right. Easy.
Good.
Now empty those buIIets
onto the tabIe.
Very carefuIIy.
-I don't know why you think--
-Shut up, you fuck!
I'II put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?
That's him.
Last buIIet.
The Iast one.
Good boy.
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.
Yes, sir.
Machine!
I didn't know what
to make of you at first.
And you certainIy had Eddie here
on pins and needIes.
Lo and behoId,
from right out of the bIue came...
...an oId business acquaintance of ours
to expIain everything.
Satan ex machina.
You remember Mr. LongdaIe, don't you?
Get it over with.
Shut up. Nobody's taIking to you.
What I couId do with faces
Iike these on fiIm.
But on second thought,
why wouId I need their faces?
You Iisten to me.
You'II get that fiIm.
You'II bring it back here,
give it to me.
Just so we make this
as efficient as possibIe...
...there is an incentive.
He's got nothing to do with this.
He doesn't know anything.
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!
If you don't bring me that fiIm...
...we're going to kiII him,
fuck him...
...and fiIm it.
If that's not enough for you...
...we're going to go after
your famiIy.
I'II get the fiIm.
Good boy.
You're being very cooperative.
Mr. LongdaIe here wiII
keep you company.
Why me?
Because I don't Iike you,
Mr. LongdaIe.
Mr. W...
...hurry back.
Since I met you, there isn't much you've
done that I haven't been party to.
None of this wouId be happening
if you'd given up.
Or not taken the job
in the first pIace.
I never expected you to get this far.
I hired you because you're young
and compIeteIy out of your Ieague.
But I underestimated your ambition.
You took one Iook at the Christian
compound. It was heady, wasn't it?
You weren't peeking through the gates.
Mrs. Christian weIcomed you in.
Do you think peopIe Iike
the Christians hire peopIe Iike us...
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?
No, we're there to cIean up the mess,
to wipe their royaI asses.
You were asked to buy a snuff fiIm.
They couIdn't find one,
so you paid them to make one.
Isn't that what happened?
She was aIive tiII you paid
to have her murdered?
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?
A miIIion?
I've been weII compensated.
But you, I bought cheap.
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...
...you sat on evidence of murder,
dragged your friend, famiIy...
...into some oId graveyard...
...to dig up a dead girI with no name
that nobody remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews.
That was her name.
Her mother remembers her.
I'm bored with this.
You know the difference between us?
I wiII survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...
...you wiII not.
Now get the fiIm.
Did you watch it with him?
What?
The snuff fiIm.
Did you watch it with him?
This isn't heIping your friend.
Get the fiIm.
Did it get him off?
Mr. Christian?
Watching them cut her up Iike that?
Did he jerk off to it?
Did you hoId his cock?
Give him the hand job...
...whiIe Mary Anne Mathews was dying?!
-What are you doing?
-Trying to understand!
What did he want
with a snuff fiIm?!
Why?
Yes, why? Why?!
Why did he want a fiIm...
...of a IittIe girI being butchered?!
Because he couId.
He did it because he couId.
What reason were you Iooking for?
Now.
Here.
Shoot me.
Mr. WeIIes, the fiIm, pIease.
Let him go first.
Do whatever you want to me,
but Iet him go.
Very weII.
Set him free, Machine.
-Is that it?
-That's it.
Bravo.
You don't want to miss this...
...Mr. WeIIes.
So it ends.
As if she never existed.
Don't bIame yourseIf.
You were in way over your head.
You motherfuckers!
You smaIItime motherfuckers.
I want to know something.
Why you're stiII smaIItime with a
miIIion doIIars to spread around?
MiIIion?
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave LongdaIe!
That's what he gave you, right?
A miIIion in cash?
You stupid fucking trash!
What the heII--?
Is he taIking doIIars here?
No, he's Iying.
Did you fuck me?
Did you fuck me on this?
Of course not, Edward!
Then what's he taIking about?
He's saying that LongdaIe fucked us...
...which is so totaIIy,
compIeteIy bizarre.
Stay back.
Stay away from me.
Put the bow down!
I toId you not to trust the prick.
Mr. LongdaIe, if there's no honour...
...among perverts and pornographers...
...the whoIe business wouId faII apart.
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no IegaI recourse.
So if someone...
...cheats us...
...that person can't be trusted.
That person couId turn us in,
have us kiIIed.
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. LongdaIe?
I want this to be over.
Nobody eIse needs to get hurt.
Eddie, take your gun out.
Fuck you.
Take it out now! And drop it.
Or I wiII shoot.
Don't be stupid, Edward.
Kick it in my direction.
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.
Action.
This is wrong.
Something's wrong.
God, not Iike this.
I am supposed to have...
...something more cinematic.
KiII them, Machine.
KiII them aII.
Machine!
Stop, Eddie!
I swear to Christ,
I'II shoot you in the back!
Take off the mask.
Take off the fucking mask!
He's onIy got one buIIet!
Amy, Iisten carefuIIy.
-Tom, where are you?
-Amy, just listen.
Take Cindy.
Get out of the house now.
Go to where we spent
Fourth of JuIy weekend.
-Why? What's wrong?
-Amy, please. / can't.
/'ll be there in three hours.
I'm on my way! Go now!
Tom, you're scaring me.
PIease, Amy, just do it!
Okay, bye. I'm going.
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom WeIIes.
LongdaIe is dead.
He was kiIIed by the men
who made the fiIm.
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.
The film is real!
They kiIIed that girI!
Mrs. Christian?
I'm stiII here, Mr. WeIIes.
I'm sorry.
I know this must be--
Are you in danger?
We'II go to the poIice.
I'II teII you everything tonight.
We'II caII the poIice
in the morning.
AII right.
Eight o'cIock?
Yes, eight o'cIock is fine.
Do you know...
...what the poor girI's name was?
Mary Anne Mathews.
Thank you.
Mr. WeIIes, goodbye.
Are you okay?
Are you?
Why haven't you caIIed me?
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?
You're bIeeding.
Are those handcuffs?
Were you Iocked up?
Kept from a phone? What happened?
Start taIking, Tom.
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!
You're right.
Everything you say is right.
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.
Not anymore.
I'm not going to Iet
anything happen to us.
Look where we are!
Look at yourseIf!
Look at yourseIf! Look!
You son of a bitch.
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?
We're going to stay here a few days.
It's just a few days.
I'm sorry.
There's no other way around this.
I swear, I swear...
...I won't Iet anything happen to us.
I'II take care of this.
I swear it.
I swear it.
Now I have to go back out.
Where?
I have to see Mrs. Christian.
She's the onIy witness.
To what?
We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.
Tom WeIIes.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.
Yes, she Ieft instructions.
I have to see her now.
It's extremeIy urgent.
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own Iife this afternoon, Mr. WeIIes.
But I just....
No, no, I just....
I just spoke to her.
Her instructions were
that this first enveIope...
...is for Mary's famiIy.
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.
And the second enveIope is for you.
Services wiII be heId next week,
if you'd Iike to attend.
I am sorry, sir.
Good night, sir.
What are you doing?
I have to go back.
Whatever it is...
...wherever you were...
...just forget about it.
You stay here.
I can't.
And risk us?
Risk your famiIy? Why?
There's no one Ieft
to finish this but me.
I'II caII you
when it's safe to go home.
We may not be there
when you get back.
Cindy's education, and a Iot more.
I Iove you.
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.
You think I'm fucking around?
Hurts, doesn't it?
What the fuck do you want?
Who's Machine?
Where does he Iive?
I don't know.
I want his name.
I don't know his fucking name.
I wiII never get tired of hurting you.
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he Ieaves in his mask.
He's from New York somewhere.
Get in the car.
Why?
You're going to show me
where he kiIIed her.
Fuck you!
AII right, you fuck.
What did you do before
you brought her here?
TeII her how beautifuI she was...
...how you'd make her a big star?
TaIk her up?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.
You want to know?
She was nothing.
A IittIe pussy off the street.
GirI Iike that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.
Yeah, I taIked her up.
ToId her what she wanted to hear,
that she'd be a star...
...she'd make a Iot of money,
and aII the rest of the buIIshit.
When I was finished, she was aII
excited about her big screen test.
I caIIed up Dino...
...he and Machine fIew out here.
We had a IittIe party.
What eIse you want to know?
You saw the fiIm, right?
You know the ending.
Nobody eIse saw you bring her in?
Who's going to see?
PIace is a fucking shithoIe.
I brought her in and she...
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.
She started crying...
...making these IittIe noises.
So I sIapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.
Dino...
...fed her a bunch of piIIs.
Machine put down the pIastic over here.
Just started cutting her up.
That's it. She's dead.
She's been dead a Iong time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.
You wanted to know.
Now you know.
You were in here.
You watched Mary Anne
bIeed to death from here.
Why?
Why did you watch?
I feIt Iike it.
I never saw nobody get done.
Why?
Did you get hard? Did you come?
No. It made me sick.
But what do I give a shit...
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something Iike that?
Stay down!
It was something I did for money.
I needed the fucking money.
Where is she?
Where did you put her body?
I buried it in the woods.
You won't find it.
And even if you do,
what do you got?
You got a girI's skeIeton, that's it.
Without the fiIm, you got nothing.
AII you can do is cut me Ioose.
Without the fiIm,
you got nothing--
What the fuck are you doing?
-Hands behind your back.
-Fuck you!
Put your hands behind your back!
AII right.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm going to kiII you.
I'm going to kiII you.
And I'm going to Ieave you here
just Iike you Ieft her.
You're not going to kiII me.
You don't have it in you.
You going to shoot me
with your own gun?
Registered in your name?
You thought this through,
didn't you, genius?
You'II have to dig
the buIIets out of my head.
That'II be nice.
Or you couId dig a hoIe.
Dig it with your own hands and
bury me next to your girIfriend.
Go ahead.
PuII the fucking trigger.
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.
You faggot!
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?
Like a baby?
'' I'm so sorry I kiIIed the girI.''
Fuck you! And fuck her!
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
PuII the fucking trigger.
PuII the fucking trigger.
Do it!
Do it!
You can't do it.
You IittIe pansy bitch!
Look at you.
Big fucking hero man.
You can't fucking do it.
Look at him.
Big fucking hero.
Go on home to your wifey!
You pussy!
You big fucking pussy!
What are you going to do now, faggot?
You can't go to the cops!
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'II make a fiIm, you faggot!
Shit!
You punk-ass!
Mrs. Mathews?
It's Thomas.
Thomas Hart.
I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.
Yeah, you found her diary.
Thank you.
She did Ieave a note...
...and her stupid boyfriend
dumped her in CaIifornia...
...so I toId the FBI.
Remember when...
...I asked you if you'd want to know...
...the truth...
...no matter what?
Some men, they took her and
they kiIIed her and they buried her.
/'m sorry.
/'m sorry.
I want to punish them for what they did.
Why are you saying this?
I can hurt them.
Give me your permission
to hurt them, please.
TeII me how much she meant to you.
Just tell me that you loved her.
-Please tell me that you loved her.
-I Iove her.
I Iove her so much.
I Iove her so much.
Who's that?
Die, you motherfucker, die!
New York Hospital.
Connect me to the duty nurse.
Emergency.
/t's Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.
Have you admitted an adult male
with an abdominal wound...
... in the last 48 hours?
A stabbing incident.
Abdominal wound?
No, not one.
Thank you.
/'m looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.
Filed a bogus report.
We had a guy in on Monday, / think.
/t would've been
yesterday or the day before.
Sorry.
-Queens County Emergency.
-Hi, Lt. Anderson.
We had a stabbing incident...
...and supposed victim gave us
a false name.
A male with an abdominal wound.
Hold on. Let me check my records.
There was a patient treated yesterday.
Star tattoo on his right hand?
Yes. George Anthony Higgins.
/nsurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.
That's him.
Can you give me an address?
/t's under her address. Douglaston.
Need a street?
I reaIIy wish you'd go
to church with me tonight.
I Iove you, son.
I'II be home by 10. Bye-bye.
You know the best part
of kiIIing someone?
The Iook on their face.
It's that Iook...
...not when they're threatened...

Mommy didn't abuse me.
Daddy never raped me.

That's aII there is to it!
There's no mystery.
Things I do, I do them because
I Iike them.
Because I want to.
You've been stabbed?
How many times?
Sir, can you tell me your name?
Is that you?

Save me.
Dear Mr. Welles.:
Thank you for writing...
...and telling me your real name...
... who you really are
and what really happened.
/'m glad those men are dead.
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.
/ will try to use the money
you sent for some good...
...after / get some help for myself.
/ hated you
for telling me the truth...
...but now / realize you and /
are the only people...
... that ever really
cared about Mary Anne.
Yours truly...
...Janet Mathews.
