And here we are.
I'm George Tillman, Jr.,
the director of the film.
- Hello, George.
- Hello.
My name is Oona Chaplin.
I play Ruth in the film
that you're about to watch.
Yes. So, let me see.
I think the script came to me
around March of 2014.
Um...
It was a script that was written...
Craig Bolotin did a draft.
And by the time I came on,
when I read the script,
Fox 2000, who I previously
had done two other films with,
wanted me to read the script.
And they were excited about it
because it was
a Nicholas Sparks script and I was...
I thought that was kind of funny.
I just thought,
"Why would they recommend me
for Nicholas Sparks material?
"You know, with Soul Food,
Men of Honor and Notorious.
And, actually,
when I sat down and thought about it,
I was pretty honored that
they were able to see me outside of...
Of your box.
That they could stretch you.
That they can stretch, right?
So, I took the script home and I read it,
and it felt pretty epic at the time,
but I felt like the script needed some work.
But Fox 2000 was very open to it
and I liked the idea of Temple Hill
with Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey
producing the film.
Cause Marty Bowen's
a real cowboy in his spare time.
So... I know,
exactly, right?
So, I thought it would be something great,
something that we can make
something great out of it.
But we had to start
with the material, but...
- Had you read the book?
- I never read the book.
I haven't...
I've only seen The Notebook.
- That was the only...
- The only reference, Yeah, me too.
Only reference
that I'd seen of...
Pretty good reference, though.
Really good reference.
I thought Ryan Gosling
was awesome in that movie.
And I thought that's
a pretty tough movie to beat,
cause a lot of fans hold that movie
to a whole another level.
So, what I loved about it,
working with Fox 2000,
Elizabeth Gabler was like,
"You can make it your own.
"You can do something
completely different.
Yeah.
So, it all started with the cast,
and, "Who are we gonna find?
And right Off the bat,
Britt Robertson was the first person
that we saw in Mary Vernieu's office.
She came in and it felt completely different
from the typical women that
have played in Nicholas Sparks films.
- Yeah, she's got spice.
- Yeah.
She's got...
She's a feisty little minx.
Yeah, yeah.
- And it felt right for the character.
- Yeah.
Someone who just wanted to.
- There she is.
- There she is.
Hello, Britt.
So, it felt something
completely right for the character,
for someone coming from New Jersey
who wanted just to study art,
and really wasn't looking for love.
Britt is a very independent person.
- I remember the first time that I met her.
- Yeah.
After we had our first sit-down,
she offered to pay for a lunch
that I put together.
Hmm.
And I was like,
"Why do you feel like...
The studio's taking care of this.
"Why do you feel like
you wanna have to pay for this lunch?
She was very adamant, saying,
"I don't like nobody taking care of me.
- I like to take care of myself, you know.
- That's perfect.
So, I started to feel
this independence about her,
and she's a young child actor.
Um...
She has her...
I figured she's, like, 23?
She owns her own house.
I didn't own my own
house until I was 30.
I know, right?
She's 23 and she owns her own...
She's something like...
Yeah, she's really very young,
but she has a very old soul.
- Yeah, she's definitely, I mean..
- Yeah.
She's got her both feet
on the ground and her head screwed on.
And she's sort of...
She knows a thing or two.
- She's really impressive.
- Very impressive.
So I said,
"Okay, who's the leading guy?
Everybody agreed that Britt Robertson
was the person to play Sophia.
So, who's gonna be Luke?
So, we saw a bunch of guys that came in,
and then Scott Eastwood came in.
And I wasn't familiar with him as an actor.
I knew he existed,
but when he came in the room, he looked...
-  I've never...
- Have you seen his abs though?
- Not then.
- You haven't seen his abs?
- Not... Not right away.
- That's really surprising.
So, I think he came in
with a button-up shirt,
- when he came in.
- Oh, really? Did he take it off?
- He didn't take it off right away.
- Damn, why not?
That's not till
after he got the role.
- But, okay!
- Right, yeah.
Then he felt more comfortable.
So, those two started...
We got them in a room
immediately together,
and there was this odd chemistry.
The chemistry was that
these two people probably
would never hang out...
Yeah.
He's from
Southern California.
She's from South Carolina.
They're completely different.
- He's this surfer guy.
- Yeah.
And then, Britt,
even though she's Southern,
she sometimes reads urban to me.
- Or metropolitan.
- Yeah.
But in the room,
there was this
magnetic thing going on between them,
this opposite that we wanted
for the two characters to have.
Oh, really?
They did have that really amazing dynamic.
They take the mickey
out of each other a lot.
- Yeah, that's what they...
- They kind of insult each other,
and then make faces at each other,
and then have a hug.
Then they have a hug right after.
In this, I thought it really worked.
Their acting style is completely different.
And then, right away,
we just felt like these two
were the two people to play the role.
I felt like Luke...
Yeah, cause Luke and Sophia
are really different.
They're really
different as people.
Him wanting to be
the number one bull rider,
getting back after an accident,
after a year.
- We felt like he needed to be...
- Look at him.
Yeah, definitely,
He's focused.
He needed to be very goal-oriented.
Actually,
you know what?
Alan Aida said something
the other day that really struck me,
and that I looked out for
when I saw the film the second time.
And every time that Luke gets on the bull,
he has a different kind of fear
come across his face.
Mmm-hmm.
Which is really extraordinary, actually,
cause he doesn't really
appear to be doing much.
But every time he gets on that bull,
you see him throughout
the course of the film,
- it's a different kind of fear.
- Yeah.
And it's a fear that's perfect
for that moment.
And that's really amazing,
the way you guys did that.
It's so perfect for
the journey that he goes on.
Yeah, And it really
worked out that he was very open
for the boot camp that we placed together.
Him working with Troy Brown,
a stunt coordinator
in Hollywood who's working,
but also who's a professional individual
who works in the PBR bull riding circuit.
He's a guy who knows bulls, knows riders,
and plus he's a stunt coordinator.
So he was very involved
in creating this boot camp...
- Oh, that's great.
- to get him prepared.
Yeah. I heard that Scott basically
went over there and said...
With a case of beer and went,
"Right. Guys, let's talk about bulls."
- And the cowboys immediately loved him.
- The cowboys...
- And that's the kind of guy he is.
- Yeah.
-"He brings beer, He's one of us.
- He brings beer, Exactly.
So, he was really ready,
you know, to get involved.
He had the physicality
that we were looking for,
he had the looks that
we needed for the romance,
and he had the chops and
the chemistry between these two.
So, when it came down to
who's going to play Ira and Ruth,
that was a lot more tougher,
in terms of "Who are we gonna find?"
Because Ruth is really
critical for the film.
She's the one that Ira adores,
she's the center of the whole story.
So, I was seeing a lot of
different individuals that came in.
No one just didn't seem right.
Everybody had chops,
and everybody had the skills,
there's a lot of people who had the looks,
but who had the spirit?
Aw.
- So...
- I'm blushing.
And you just came in.
I think it was at the end of the day,
after we saw a bunch of people.
You came in.
And I think I still have
that audition somewhere.
Oh, gosh.
You just came in
and you just had this spirit,
and this nice, lovable thing.
It just reminded me
of this Richard Lester film
- that I told you about, Petulia.
- Yeah.
That Julie Christie
played in 1967 or '68.
Such a good film.
And that spirit,
that quirkiness, but also having a heart
that you would immediately
fall in love with.
So, you came in, and I wanted you
for this role right after you left.
But then you were
on a plane going back to...
Going back to Europe.
It's been an interesting
few months for that.
It's been a bit of backwards and forwards.
I think I'm still dizzy from it.
Yeah, You know...
I still haven't quite recovered
from those trips.
Yeah,
You had a concern that...
A lot of people had a concern about,
"What's people's perception
of the material?
Or maybe I was feeling the same way as...
Maybe,
"How does this connect to me?
"I don't want this to feel corny
or feel oversentimental.
I don't know if that's
what you were feeling,
but I was feeling that way
and I had to dig that within myself.
But I even had to explain that
even to these guys, to Scott and Britt.
I find that with every person
who's in the movie.
But you had reservations early on.
Yeah. There was a couple of
things, I think, that were my prejudice,
particularly with women
sacrificing anything for men,
and men not sacrificing
anything for their women.
I mean, historically, that's been the case.
And as a woman, I find that
a little bit hard to swallow.
But, really, what won me over
was you explaining to me that
it's just all about love.
And when I heard that you've been
together with your woman for so long,
and that just having a real sit-down
and actually thinking,
"What's important in life?
That's what won me over to the script.
It was you telling me about love.
And I was like, If anybody
can do this film that's about love,
"then it's gonna be George.
So, that's what made me wanna do it.
That is awesome,
I just remember a...
I never actually made a phone call to Paris.
- That was my first phone call to Paris.
- Oh, really?
I've been to Paris,
but I never made a phone call there.
Never made a phone call to...
- Yeah.
- I was staying at a really nice hotel as well.
I think it was...
Yeah, it's gotta be 12:00 my time,
which was really late,
I think you're...
Yeah, we were, and I think I had
a photo shoot, or I had something.
What was I doing?
I can't even remember
what I was doing in Paris.
Yeah.
So, I made a phone call,
we talked for a while.
And then, I get off the phone and told Fox.
Fox loved you.
And so, I'm glad it happened,
because that was the center point of...
It was great, because you and Britt,
as the two leading ladies,
are completely different.
- Oh, we're polar opposites.
- And...
But we have a lot in common,
which is good.
- Which is great, you know?
- Yeah.
And so, it came down to
"Who's going to play Ira?
And I remember Jack Huston 's name
came up early.
For some reason,
I heard that he passed early,
but then it turned out that
he was actually doing a play in London.
And it was just that
he just wasn't available.
But then he became available.
So, really, it was just a meeting, really.
- Yeah.
- Between you two guys.
We didn't even have time to audition,
cause I think he was going out
or doing something the next...
- Yeah, he was working.
- He was working on something.
And so, we sat down at a restaurant,
actually, in the lobby of my office.
- Yeah.
- And it was really late one night.
- And you guys just...
- He just charmed my pants off, really.
- Really? Right away, right?
- It was like, "Look at this charming man.
- Yeah, you know...
- How dare he be so charming?
I know, right?
It was just... It was great.
It was about 20 minutes.
It wasn't even long.
- Yeah, it wasn't long at all.
- It wasn't long.
And then you took
a photo out in the hall,
and I was like, "He's gonna look
so much better than me in this photo.
I just had a whole day
of talking to people.
And you know
what I really love, too,
is that it had a sense
of color in the story.
I like you guys complexion.
You guys are darker...
Yeah, It's like
Barbie and Ken,
and then versus
Wonder Woman and Action Man.
Yeah.
Cause, really, Scott Eastwood
looks like a Ken doll.
- I mean, it's actually uncanny.
- Yeah, you know?
They should make
a Barbie and Ken film
and just cast Scott as Ken,
cause it works.
It works, right?
I believe it, I buy it.
And I just love that
it just had different perspectives
and that really honed in
the visual style for me
in terms of the movie, is that,
really, these are two different stories
with two different visual styles,
two different looks
in terms of camera style,
in terms of camera lighting,
in terms of sets
and, sometimes, even behavior.
How these guys' scenes
are completely different
from what you guys are
doing in the '40s through this,
all the way up to 2000.
Yeah, cause this part of the film
that we're watching now
has this cleaner look, doesn't it?
It's more like, it is very...
It's actually very modern.
It's very pristine and it's got that
really lovely Southern feel as well.
- You can really tell you're in the South.
- Yes.
Like everybody's colors...
It's all the nice pastels
and nice green leaves and all the...
- Yeah.
- It's lovely.
And then in our bit it's more like...
It's got that vintage feel to it.
It's more tungsten,
ls that even a word?
- Yeah...
- I don't know if that's the right term for it.
- You're close enough...
- I'm trying to be technical.
That's good, I like you
being technical, That's good.
- Yeah, I'm with you, I'm with you.
- I don't know about those things.
- But definitely...
- More sepia.
- Yeah, there you go. There you go.
- It's a little more sepia.
And we're pretty much...
I mean, we really made sure that
these two stories look completely different.
But what really made it organically
connect together was the relationship,
which, almost,
I always counted as a third story,
- which is Sophia and the older Ira.
- Yeah.
Which is almost...
Their color tone is very neutral,
which allows us to go back and forth
between our de-saturated look in the 1940s
to the saturated look...
- Yeah, he's a real good link.
- in the modern look here, so...
- Look at this.
- Yeah, that's great.
So, really, what's really
working here in terms of story is the setup,
pretty much Luke meeting Sophia.
Luke is a dreamy cowboy.
Yes, He has
to go into campus.
And he's got all the sorority
sisters sighing and squealing.
So, here we
are on our first date.
And I think it was a very important scene,
because in the setup
of most romantic stories,
usually, the first date
leads these guys in the right path.
But for these guys,
it leads them the opposite way.
They decide to go in a different direction
and not really pursue a relationship.
And I really like that idea,
that that's really counter...
A little bit counter
what you really expect in most romance...
- Cause also, it's a perfect date.
- Yes.
- It couldn't go any better.
- Yeah.
This is the thing, right?
This type of film should inspire people
to make these kind of dates happen.
And not just for a first date.
Just, if you're married for 60 years,
take your woman out in your truck
and take her to a nice lake.
- And look at what he's doing.
- Yep.
Look at this lovely lake.
Where was this? Where did we shoot this?
This was...
God, I think this was in Winston-Salem.
Winston-Salem,
Look at this beautiful lake.
- I mean...
- Yeah.
Hang on, it's coming,
It's coming.
- There it is.
- Yeah.
You can see
it in her face.
It just takes your
breath away, really.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Yes, I think people should be
very inspired to do this kind of thing.
Yeah, this location
that you just mentioned,
it was actually in Winston-Salem,
near the college Winston-Salem.
And this is a place called
Dobson, North Carolina.
- Dobson.
- This place was hidden away.
It was actually owned,
all this land is owned by one family.
- Oh, we were there as well.
- Yes.
That's where we shot
Black Mountain, isn't it?
Yes, This is where
the Black Mountain was shot as well.
Yeah.
It was beautiful around there.
- Beautiful place and...
- And such a nice family.
Nice family.
Nobody had ever shot here before,
so they allowed us to come in.
I kind of knew that
tips from my dad's diner...
weren't really going to cut it.
I just...
I love art.
I love everything about it.
I love studying it.
I love the culture that it brings...
and the whole human experience...
Here is...
Now this scene was always discussed,
how we can get it right.
Scott was always concerned
about this scene.
How can you make this
a really great relationship,
a great first moment in just one night?
And, ultimately, we tried different scenes,
and ultimately, this scene was
put together by a combination,
written by a combination
of different individuals.
And we came up to the idea of,
"It's a long night.
It's really a succession of three,
possibly four different scenes
in one particular night.
Mark lsham's score's
really working very minimally
in a very nice, subtle way.
But what we found that really made
the scene really work was that
you're looking at two individuals
who are talking about
their needs and their goals.
This was the center of
what the story's about,
with the young Sophia/Luke story,
is that, even today, it's like
a commentary on today's society,
- is that we're so goal-oriented.
- Yeah, we are.
He wants to be the number
one bull rider, She wants to go to New York.
They're ignoring this emotional magnet
between each other.
They're ignoring this little chemistry
that they're having.
And even after a beautiful night,
they both choose to keep going
and let it just go by the wayside.
And Sophia's really the one
who's the first person,
she's the one who's more ready to let it go.
Yeah.
And I always liked that idea, was that,
she's the one who's making the choice,
actually, not to pursue love.
- Yeah.
- And he's the one who wants to continue.
Well, it's also
like she's...
I mean, bull riders don't have
a very long career.
Whereas, she is looking at a really lengthy,
and the-sky's-the-limit career opportunity.
- Yes.
- Which is, I think, a lot harder to give up,
especially as she says...
Later on in the film, she mentions that
she comes from
quite a humble background.
And she has this opportunity
to break through that
and become a big, big fish in the art world.
And that's what she wants.
And so, I don't know.
She's kind of like,
her whole thing is New York and it's so sad.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Cause they...
'Cause, I mean, look at his eyes.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Look at his little eyes.
Oh, they almost kiss.
- Almost, and they...
- But they didn't.
- Yeah. They used to at one point.
- They used to.
- Really? Yeah, right.
- Yeah.
There was a
cut before you saw.
Did someone eat some garlic
or something?
Yeah. No, what happened
was, we decided to save it.
They did...
We had a couple...
We had one early test screening
and the audience felt
they kissed a little too soon.
So I took it out,
and then we shot the bar scene
where they actually go out
on their second date.
So we created a second date for these guys.
Oh.
And I just felt
like it worked stronger.
Again, it's that they want to,
but they just can't.
They got other goals in mind.
And I really like this scene, too,
'cause it takes its time.
It's like a two minute, two-and-a-half
minute scene on both fronts,
with them at the table
and then here, them at the fire.
- Yeah.
- It's allowing two people to talk.
It's allowing the audience to really get into
their relationship and be with them.
And then you're gonna hear
the thunderstorm that's gonna
come in the background.
That's one of the things
that I discussed early on, is just...
How do you make
a thunderstorm happen?
Yeah, it was more like...
Mostly, I always remember
in Nicholas Sparks films,
always it's raining with thunderstorm,
and they're kissing in the rain
and everything.
So, I always felt like...
They're always
kissing in the rain.
Yeah, so I felt
like here in our story,
all the thunderstorm
and rain always happens
when the story shifts
or when something big plot-wise
is going to happen.
So it's not necessarily complementing
or exploring love.
It's just exploring story.
- Yeah.
- Right now the story is, during this rain,
there's gonna be a life-altering change
with these characters,
because they're about to meet the older Ira
in the car, on the side of the road here.
And this is the change in their story.
Alan, Alan.
Alan, wake up.
Alan, wake up. Grab the torch.
Just open the door, Scott.
There you go. That's it. Pull him out.
- He's such a legend, Goodness.
- Yeah. Awesome guy to work with.
Oh! Alan Aida,
What an institution.
It's actually beautiful,
this thing about the rain,
because the rain in North Carolina
is astonishing.
Mmm-hmm.
I mean, it starts pouring down
and there's drops as big as your hand.
- Yeah.
- And it just soaks you through.
And you don't understand
where it came from.
Yeah, yeah.
And it doesn't, also,
ever seem to stop once it starts.
One of the guys on the set
was always saying...
He says, "Welcome to North Carolina.
"If you don't like the weather,
just hold on 10 minutes and it'll change.
It will change, exactly.
And that's exactly what happened.
It would rain for about 10, 15 minutes,
and then it would be
completely different later.
Yeah, And then it'll be sunshine
and not a cloud in the sky,
- and mosquitos...
- Yeah, It is a great thing.
- That was my first time in North Carolina.
- Yeah, me too.
And it was awesome
because we shot in Wilmington,
we shot in Greensboro,
we shot in Jacksonville.
We shot in Dobson.
These are all the cities that
we were able to shoot most of the film in,
and I never knew that
North Carolina was that huge.
- And that beautiful.
- And beautiful.
It doesn't seem like it's...
It's not like a tourist destination
- for some reason.
- No.
- But it is absolutely stunning.
- Yeah.
- Like those Smoky Mountains?
- Awesome.
- I mean, come on.
- Yeah, beautiful. Beautiful.
- And you had good food as well, grits.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Hello, grits for lunch.
- Were you near...
You were living right next to
a restaurant or something...
Yeah, we were living
right next to number 9,
which is such a brilliant place
'cause they served us grits.
They just saw me coming
and they knew that
they had to put some grits on the table.
And yeah, we were staying
in this beautiful little cottage
called the French Cottage,
or the French House.
And Jeremy Irons had
stayed there before.
And I was staying in this little annex
with the lowest ceilings I've ever seen.
Everything looked miniature.
And they were really low ceilings.
And every time I got into the shower,
I hit my head on the ceiling.
Oh, really?
And I started thinking
about Jeremy Irons
every time I got in the shower,
cause he's really tall.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And if I was hitting my head,
I don't know how he would have been,
like, managing this space.
I don't know what he did.
But it was a lovely house.
It was so beautiful and the...
You stayed there
the whole time, right?
Yeah, the people
were so nice.
And it's true, we were right in
the center of the historical part of town.
- Yeah.
- The historical district.
And just everyone's so nice,
and the food is just grits.
- I'm completely in love with grits.
- Really? With grits.
And here now,
this is where we start shifting,
where we start getting
into our second story...
- Here we go.
- which is Ruth and Ira.
- Back in time.
- Back in time.
So, just to talk about briefly,
we had about a week,
maybe a week and a couple of days
to really start talking about the character,
'cause the script was shifting so much.
And a lot of that was, you know,
just trying to really make the schedule,
make the budget, and to make
the characters in the story improve.
But one of the great things is that
I had you and Jack
for about six, seven days.
And really, just with wardrobe,
and talking about makeup,
and then we were
talking about the characters.
So, we had this nice,
big conference room at this hotel
at the Hyatt, downtown Wilmington.
And we would just spend hours
just talking about the character.
Talking it through,
talking it through.
It was so great, actually,
to be able to rehearse
and go, like, really get your teeth
stuck in, It was so lovely.
- And Jack was really up for it as well.
- Yeah.
And we were all just sitting there,
analyzing everything that we could.
- Yeah.
- Every doubt that came up,
we'd just battle it right until the end,
just for the sake of it.
Just for the sake of
really understanding these people
and what brings them together.
It was really
totally stimulating and wonderful.
Yeah, it was a great process.
It was completely different, too,
with what Sophia and Luke's process was.
With those guys,
I'd rehearse some of the scenes,
and we'd talk about the objectives,
about the characters, what they want,
do some blocking and...
Or sometimes, we'd throw out some lines.
But we'll go through the scenes.
And that was just the style
for that particular story.
- Yeah.
- You guys' style was completely different.
Sometimes we'd show up,
and then you and Jack
would just sometimes
- start talking for, like, 30, 40 minutes.
- I know, you were so patient, George.
- Cause you guys...
- You deserve a medal.
You deserve some kind of prize
for having to put up with us.
Cause you guys talk a lot,
and you guys have got this chemistry
that's just amazing.
It's just... l don't know cause of
the European thing or something.
Both of you guys
spent a lot of time
over there.
And that's great, 'cause all that culture,
all those worldviews that you have
is really what Ruth...
And I love that, 'cause I felt like
talking is really rehearsing.
- Yeah, Understanding.
- And that's part of the process.
Understanding,
And so, we spent...
Your story spent...
Our rehearsals were different.
- Yeah.
- Where it'll just be a lot of talking.
Sometimes we'd stand up on our feet.
- Yeah.
- We'd do a little bit.
Jack was always concerned
not getting too into the scenes early.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted to save the money.
- You have to be very delicate with Jack.
- Yeah.
And the difference with Scott and Luke,
with Scott and Sophia, or Scott and Britt,
- they just liked to do it over and over.
- Yeah.
So, it was a different, delicate thing,
and that's what you learn as a director,
- each actor has a different...
- Yeah.
Different situations.
And I noticed that you and Jack
spent a lot of time at night, or restaurants,
- or talking, or going over the material.
- Yeah.
Or sometimes you guys
would write some things,
or I'll write some things and
we'll come together and throw it out.
So it had that leisurely,
but in-depth, rehearsal time.
- Yeah, It was so wonderful.
- Yeah.
I think every film should have
at least a week rehearsal,
where everybody just gets to actually...
Cause our story
was really filled throughout.
Like, really filled out
throughout that time.
We understood,
we went deeper than on the surface
just by analyzing the whys
and the hows and the whats.
And we really managed to fill it out.
And, actually,
when it came to doing it on set,
it was so much easier
than if you were trying things out on set
that you weren't really sure about.
Yeah.
It was a total privilege to have
those days of just hanging out
- and going into the script.
- Yeah.
And also, I think, 'cause
Jack and I both have got that
slightly cynical aspect
to British heritage.
We get raised with this love story.
- We're like, "Nah, come on.
- Right. Right.
Cause the...
I don't know.
There's an inherent cynicism in the UK
that you don't really get here.
People are much happier
expressing their feelings here.
So, it was good just to be able to
actually talk about feelings,
and about really going for it.
And, actually, once we made the...
It was almost like
we had to make a decision that
we were gonna be really romantic.
It was almost like
we had to make some kind of,
"Okay, it's gonna be all right?
Yeah? It's all right?
"It's all right if we...
Okay, we're gonna do this, right?
- We're gonna? Okay, let's do it.
- Right, right.
And it would...
Then we went in full romance mode.
Mmm-hmm.
So, I mean, interesting,
with your character,
what was your...
I know we spent time talking
and we talked a little bit about the book,
more about the script.
What was your process
of preparing for Ruth?
I think it was a lot
to do with the accent.
And I think the accent and the period
were two things that
really informed the character,
because it's so different
to what I'm used to, evidently.
And they're boundaries that
then you can find a lot of freedom within.
But really setting those boundaries
and being confident.
I never thought in my life
that I would be playing Austrian.
So, it's not one of the accents
that I just have up my sleeve.
So, working with a dialect coach,
and really trying to get it sounding natural,
and right, and not too much,
and not too little...
And I think that, sort of, was the main...
That was the main bulk of it.
And then, from then on,
it was just working with Jack and you
to try and get the truth of the scenes.
Because I'm familiar with...
I'm quite familiar with
World War ll history in Europe
because that's what I studied
in school, in history class.
And I was always very interested in history.
So, that's something that I found...
I had a lot of references
that came quite quickly
with the whole Jewish community.
I'd also just read this fantastic book
about Viennese nobility or aristocracy
that were very involved in the arts.
- So I think that helped as well.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, just trying to get the truth of the...
This was an interesting scene.
Because this scene,
it's their first date, really.
Yes.
And yet, here she is talking
about the horrors of the Holocaust,
which I really shouldn't be laughing about.
I'm laughing at the juxtaposition
of those two things,
- rather than of the actual...
- Yeah, Yeah.
The events.
But it was a really hard balance to get
because, obviously, what was
happening in Europe at the time
was just so inhuman and confusing
and dark and just preposterous.
Yeah.
And especially for these guys
that had left and still had family there
and didn't know how to get in touch.
And you'd hear
all these stories on the news
and in the papers and
you wouldn't know what was true.
And you couldn't possibly believe
some of the things that they were doing.
So it was really difficult to
just tap that on the surface
and then go back to being all smiley and...
First date with this lovely guy and like...
There he is. Now he's gonna...
Yes, Jack. Go on, ask me out.
And I love that look, too,
that you gave him when he turned away,
like he cannot ask you out.
And that's just such a great thing.
I just love when
you and Jack and Britt and Scott,
when you guys are
completely in the moment,
completely being honest in the moment.
And as a director, you love that
because you're surprised with...
I'm gonna be surprised by
what you're gonna do.
And I love that,
being surprised, not knowing.
How do you take what's on paper and really
just take it to another level because...
Humanly or behaviorally,
that is what you're gonna do.
And that's the reason why I love this scene,
is because it really showed
the sense of where...
It shows the beginning
of happiness in what she finds,
when you say on the beach,
"This is the first time I've been happy.
And then it goes later
to when you leave him.
It's all connected to happiness.
That's what we were saying.
"What is Ruth's drive?
What is what you want?"
And we always came
down to happiness or...
- Yeah, goodness.
- Goodness was the word.
Yeah.
That's one of the things
that I really loved about Ruth, actually,
more than anything else,
was the fact that
she had come from this world
of tragic suffering of her people.
Which, if you...
You hear stories about the Holocaust
and you think this couldn't have happened,
one human being could not have done this
to another human being.
It's just insane that this happened.
Only a few decades ago. It's crazy.
And she comes from this place of darkness,
and all she wants to do is make
love and life and light come out of it.
Let's go to Luke Collins.
If he makes a qualified ride
on Carolina Thunder...
he will crack the top 35
and punch his ticket to Vegas!
Let's go!
So here we
are in the bull riding...
Which is the most exciting thing
I've ever seen in my life, by the way.
Well, this is one of the great
things that I liked about the story,
is that I haven't... There's only really
been one film that I remember
that dealt with bull riding,
I think it was a film called 8 Seconds,
but it was done years ago.
And in exploring what bull riders
go through in the process,
it really became very different for me
when I went to Las Vegas for...
In 2014 to see the championship,
the final championship
for the bull riders that year.
And watching it on television, I thought,
"Okay, it's a cool sport. It's great."
But when they put me behind the chute,
when I actually saw the bulls and the force,
how they come out of that chute
and how dangerous and how much force
and how fast eight seconds really is,
it changed my perspective
of how to shoot the bull.
And my perspective as a director was
really try to make the audience to feel
what it's really like to be a bull rider.
And each scene,
I felt should feel very different,
and it should be shot
in a very different style.
And at the same time,
I should really, really get the idea
of what Luke and his agenda is
in every scene,
so it doesn't feel like the bull riding scenes
had nothing to do with the story.
So, it's a combination of those things
that really made us attack each sequence
and made it the best they could really be.
A lot of that was done
with having six, seven cameras.
A lot of that was done
bringing in the phantom camera,
where we would be able to shoot
very, very slow speed,
where we can really capture the muscles,
the speed, the energy,
what the bull riders go through,
and really, a combination
of angles that I felt that
even the PBR circuit and the PBR
has not even shot themselves,
in terms of the angles,
the styles and the placement.
So, a lot of that was done
through prep with,
you know,
first attacking through storyboards,
attacking what the scene is about,
also attacking what is the best way
visually to shoot these scenes.
And you really can't really
shoot your load early,
because you got the last sequence
coming up in the very last act.
So everything had to be built towards that.
So, it took us about, um...
I think we shot all the bull riders
at the end of the film
in nine days or something like that.
And that was in Jacksonville,
wasn't it?
That was all...
Well, it was a combination
of Jacksonville and Winston-Salem.
And the Jacksonville was the first scene
where Luke meets Sophia outside.
And the rest of the Winston-Salem
was actually done
where all the other sequences
were done at the same time.
So, with that,
I mean, we had a lot of great help.
I mean, we had the real guys
out there who...
These guys, you know,
like Sean Willingham, Kasey Hayes,
Sammy Matthews, Brant Atwood,
Billy Robinson, Cody...
I heard so many
stories about those cats.
- These are the real guys.
- They really left their mark on set.
These guys
are the real guys.
They did a lot of the
bull riding in the movie.
These guys came out, did it multiple times,
cause sometimes you shoot a bull ride,
and sometimes they'd only be
on there for two seconds.
Then you got to keep going
until you can go back and do it again.
- So these guys were rolling...
- They had a championship coming up.
They had a championship coming up too,
so all those guys were doing double duty.
They didn't want to
injure themselves
too badly whilst they were making the film,
because they wanted to go and compete.
But at the same time, they had to
make the film look really good
and that's their passion,
so they were doing it 100% anyway.
So, it was really high stakes
for those guys sometimes.
Very, very high stakes.
And these guys, the PBR, were awesome.
I mean, without them
we would not have done...
Gotten everything we needed for the film.
You know who else I think
really made the film
just so special, was Babs McDance.
- Yes.
- Babs McDance,
who was, no kidding, our dance teacher.
This is the scene where we're
going in to have a little boogie.
And we met this lovely woman
who came to do the choreography with us
for hours and hours and hours,
until Jack got it 'cause...
I got it instantly,
but Jack took a little longer.
But, yes, this woman
was actually called Babs McDance,
and she was, I think, made of sunshine.
Her molecular composition
is joy and unicorns.
This woman is the happiest pumpkin
I've ever met.
Wow.
And this was great too,
because you guys were... I was...
This was in the middle of the shoot,
so I was still shooting.
She would send me over tapes
of what you guys were doing.
And it was interesting,
seeing you guys on video.
I'm sorry. She was showing us tape
of what you were trying to explain to her
that you wanted for the scene.
And watching George Tillman, Jr.
try and do a 1940s little step is hilarious,
'cause he just looks like a gangster
trying to have...
I don't know what he was trying to do.
It was beautiful.
- It was pure, pure joy.
- Oh, man.
And this was great.
You guys were on time
all the way, every take.
And look at Jack.
He really got it, man, he really got it.
He's actually a brilliant dancer.
I'm just making fun of him.
And all these guys around
them are all from her school, I believe.
Yeah, they were all
the North Carolina dancers.
- Mmm-hmm.
- The Wilmington dancers.
But you know what?
There is such a beauty to this kind of dance
that doesn't really exist anymore,
where you actually have to make
physical contact with the other person
and you have to, sort of, read...
It's almost like you have to
physically read what they're saying.
It's like you have to obey, particularly
the guys that are... The guy's lead.
Yeah.
- And... Oh! There's a smooch.
- There it is, yeah.
The guy's lead and the girl has to listen
to the slightest touch of the hand,
to go left or right or up or down.
And it's such a... There's such
intrinsic beauty to this type of dancing
that I think is perfect for the film.
Yeah.
It immediately makes you feel...
Have butterflies in your belly.
- Yeah.
- And so do these cars, as well.
These cars make me have butterflies.
Yeah, it was very hot this day
when we were shooting.
Oh, my goodness,
it was boiling.
And getting into that car
with no air conditioning
was just the sweatiest experience,
I think, of the whole film.
This was a fun day.
Yeah, it was a fun day.
There are some great
beaches in North Carolina.
A lot of these guys contribute
and really brought something to the script.
Craig Bolotin did the original draft.
Also, just with the actors,
making the lines, making them work.
You guys tweaking,
constantly tweaking on the set.
That's something you don't want to do.
You want to have a script ready to go,
but we were on a fast deadline.
Everybody was... It was moving fast.
But when you really
spend time in rehearsals
and spend time with the characters,
you know what feels right and what don't.
And that's what
that rehearsal time really did.
But off the bat,
everybody made a commitment
on both stories, the actors on both stories.
"How can we make this
the best that we can make it?
"How can we stay away from clichés?
"How can we make sure the audience,
when they're watching it,
"they don't quite know
what's going to happen
"or what's not going to happen?"
So, once you make that commitment
on all fronts with the department heads,
everybody on one accord,
what's the theme, what's the story,
you really have a good chance
to really tell a good story.
And I think it starts with us
as creative people saying,
How can we make sure
we're not repeating
"or make sure we're not making something
"that we all have seen
and the audience is gonna be bored?"
This scene is a great example of
what you're saying, actually, because it...
I mean, I've never watched a film
where before the guy is about to propose,
the girl says, "Well, stop right there.
I want loads of kids.
"So unless you're prepared to give me that,
I'm not gonna say yes. So you should...
"I'll save you the embarrassment.
These are my conditions first.
I mean, it's so unexpected,
actually.
And that's something I really like
about Ruth and about the script.
- It's kind of...
- Yeah.
- It's sort of...
- Yeah.
And this bit, we didn't... I mean, we...
I think it changed at one point
and then we changed it back.
We changed it back, yeah.
To the original of,
"No, I want a family.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I think it's great.
And I think we even
threw this, we even...
The scene got longer and I cut it down.
Even to break up the rhythm of,
"Okay, here's the proposal scene."
We even, when you're about...
Yeah, you interrupt him the first time
because you say this is about the kids.
And then we even threw in
the mom at one point...
Yeah, that's right.
Ruthie, the mom
interrupted and threw him off again...
But we just, I felt like,
"Okay, it worked really well."
Yeah,
it's cleaner like this.
- It's lovely.
- It's cleaner this way.
It's more to the point.
So, here we have
the story of Sophia
hearing all the stories
from Ira,
the older Ira.
Now it makes her realize
about her relationship
and that's what this moment is about,
her, "How can I pursue?
How can I make things better?
"How can I personalize
my feelings, my emotions?
And it is connecting her to Luke
a little bit more now
after hearing Ira and Ruth's story.
And a very fateful song
comes on the radio.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then we just connect it right to
Luke driving in the same fashion,
and thinking about her.
So again, it's trying
to focus the story.
I have to say,
I had a really great post-production team.
I had a great editor, Jason Ballantine,
who really was in the...
He was in the fighting fields with me
with this story.
It's hard, because you've got
two different stories,
so when do you come out of one story,
when do you begin another?
The biggest challenge was
how can the B-story, Ruth and Ira,
really come in and help our A-story along?
Yeah.
If that connection doesn't
happen, the movie doesn't work at all.
So then it came down to the point,
"When are they making comments?
"When is that happening?
So, it was making sure
that when they meet,
that's when we meet Ira and Ruth.
When they break up, that's when
Ira and Ruth are gonna break up.
When they have their biggest
situation and obstacle,
that's when Ruth and Ira
will have their biggest obstacle.
And it really wasn't...
I was concerned at one point
that it really wasn't on the nose,
but it's very subtle in how it works
and how it crosses over.
But I think what it does is
it proposes the universality of love.
But also retains the individual nature
and the particular nature
of each relationship,
which is different.
Each relationship is faced
with different challenges
and each life has different obstacles
and things to overcome.
But ultimately, we all want the same thing.
- Yes.
- And I think that's what it captures.
What you guys really, I think,
captured beautifully.
So there's a couple things
I did to really make the connection more,
just with the photo booth there.
I shot Luke and Sophia in
a photo booth as well to connect that.
What's so funny too
is all filmmakers out there,
if any filmmaker is watching
and listening to this, you know,
our makeup test just with wardrobe,
I just shot you guys in a photo booth
just to see how you guys looked
and we ended up using it.
Yes, that's right,
I remember that.
So I try to shoot things
and try to get extra things in.
Luke and Sophia did the same thing, so...
This is just...
This was the...
Actually, this whole section was
a part of the lunch break, wasn't it?
Yeah.
You just cut and you just shot
a little bit of the lunch break.
Yeah.
That's what lunch
looked like on set.
The people throwing the bombs are the...
Yeah.
This was all done...
- Grips and the...
- Yeah.
This was done all in six hours,
this whole scene.
This is North Carolina in the summertime,
you don't get night very long.
I think you get six hours.
Yeah, which is
the perfect position
for the very limited shooting schedule.
But everybody was great.
The stunt coordinators worked this out.
My AD, H. H. Cooper really did a great job,
really organizing what shots we need,
when the bombs drop, when we go
right into the dialogue moments.
We actually came out...
We... the day...
The weekend before,
we actually choreographed
the whole scene,
so we'd be ready to rock and roll
a few days later when we shot the scene.
So, all that really worked out right.
But it really came down to,
"Okay, how do we...
We don't want to just shoot a war scene.
"How's this working
with the narrative?
And I looked at it like I did
with the bull riding.
This whole sequence is all about,
"Got to get back to Ruth.
You promised.
I promised I was gonna come back.
So using "I promised" really informed
what this scene needed to be.
And this is something too,
was just straight in the narrative,
which is,
I got to get back to Ruth.
So, that's what this scene
really is all about,
is getting back to a love and a life
because the marriage didn't happen.
It was interrupted by World War ll.
- It finally caught up with you guys.
- Yeah, Yeah.
And here he is
with a very bad fever.
Yep.
I'm very sorry.
I think it's nice how you resolve
this whole thing about
what actually happened to him,
to stop him from
being able to have children.
I think it was a tough challenge,
because how do you...
How do you say it without saying it?
How do you tell the story without...
Yeah.
Without going in...
I mean, without going into
the ins and outs of
the specific medical condition?
And I think it becomes very clear,
right now you don't really know what's up.
And it's very nice,
'cause it leaves a little bit of mystery.
Yeah.
And then in the next scene,
the audience finds out
at the same time as Ruth.
Yeah.
And I think this house
that we shot, your home,
was right down the street
from where you were living, right?
Yeah.
It was right around the corner.
That's pretty much where...
That's what where I was living looked like,
which was just so delightful.
Always liked the
last moment of this scene,
when he finally looks up at you.
He refused to look at you in the face
because of his broken promise
to come back,
which is physically coming back to see you,
but he chose to alienate you
because of how he's feeling,
what he's not able to do,
which is have kids.
And he's not 100% sure on that yet.
There's still a chance.
Which we spent a lot of time talking about.
But it's this very moment
when he finally does look at you,
I just love that...
He's very broken.
Yeah.
But somehow in this moment
when you sit down
and he finally looks at you,
it's like this moment,
which only Ruth can give,
it's just full of love and I'm here for you.
It's one of my favorite moments
that I always made sure
I preserved and didn't cut down
and I just stayed with it.
It's just that look there,
how you're just there for him.
I really love that moment.
That was really
difficult for me to access.
That was actually a really...
'Cause it is that thing of, you know,
"How do you treat someone
who's just come back from
the most horrific
experience of their life?
"How do you approach this person
who's just come back from the war?
And there is a real balance
to be found between
not pitying, no pity,
because pity is an alienating attitude.
Yeah.
And no...
But at the same time,
you can't be too hard on them.
So, it's like this really
interesting balance.
And I think it was helpful
to think about all the...
I've got a couple of friends
that have been in the war,
like, in the Middle East now.
And it was helpful to think about
what they would want.
Yeah.
Which is just,
"I'm here if you want to talk.
"If you don't want to talk,
if you want to go out
"for a glass of wine,
I'm here, too.
Yeah, yeah.
And our... Here, so in this moment,
it was interesting, in the script,
originally written,
Ruth comes in and says,
"Ask me now.
And then Ruth here...
Ruth here says something totally
different that I totally fucked up.
Ruth says
something totally different.
When he came in, you were like,
"I can't say these words.
I don't think I feel right.
Well, it's just...
The way that it was written was...
It came out as something
that she was desperate for.
- And I was very reluctant to give in to that.
- Mmm-hmm.
Because I felt like it was more
she's calling his bluff
rather than if he doesn't marry her,
she's gonna die.
- Yeah.
- So, I really wanted it to be that,
and that it was clear that she was going,
"No, don't play these
games with me.
"I know you want to marry me.
I want to marry you.
- I know what I'm getting into, It's fine.
- Yeah.
But then, as you know, as I often do,
got a little carried away.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got a little carried away.
And it was one of the only times
that I think we didn't reach
a constructive compromise,
in a way.
But, hey, it doesn't look too bad.
It doesn't look too bad.
Yeah, it worked out.
- It was all right.
- Yeah.
- And I remember, too...
- I think Jack really makes it, that one.
- Yeah.
- Jack makes that scene.
Cause I remember
we were ready
to shoot this scene right here,
this love scene.
She's such a hussy
in the '40s, having sex.
In the '40s.
And I remember
we're about to,
it was about 20 minutes before shooting,
and someone came over to me,
cause I had this big idea of
how to block the scene out.
And they came to me and Fox was like,
"They don't want you to shoot the scene
the way you imagined.
The woman isn't on top,
basically.
Yeah, it was a scene
where you sit Ira down on the chair.
- Yeah.
- And then you get on top of him and...
- And do him a favor.
- And do him a favor.
I felt like, again,
that's us really pushing the cliches,
which in the '40s stories,
you don't really see that.
And we talked about it early on.
Everybody was game.
Everybody was...
You were game.
And everybody in the '40s
was game, Let's not pretend.
Yeah,
And you were like,
in terms of what we show,
and everybody, with Britt and Scott,
nobody had any issues.
We knew we couldn't show much.
But in terms of, "How do we make this
the best love story and feeling real?
"Let's push the sexuality.
Let's push what we have.
I think you told me,
I've been nude in stuff before.
"I don't care.
Or something, you know?
- I love sex scenes, They're hilarious.
- Yeah.
99% Of the time.
But, also, I think it's...
I mean, it's obviously important
to do them with taste,
because you don't want to enter
this world of cheap boobs and bum
and all this kind of stuff.
It has to be relevant.
But in this film, it's particularly relevant,
because these couples are,
as you said the other day,
they're so mismatched.
They're so unlikely
that the thing that's really
tying them together is chemistry.
It's like this undeniable,
unstoppable, magnetic force
bringing these people together.
And that is often expressed through sex.
And through that kind of intimacy.
So, I think it was
really important in this film
to get the things that are bringing
these couples together
as well as the things
that are tearing them apart.
Yeah. So we were
about to shoot the scene,
you were about to straddle him.
And they were like... Fox said,
"No, they don't want you to do that
with the '40s story.
"Just calm that part down.
And I was like...
I was a little mad for a moment.
And I told you guys about it
and we just did the scene...
Anyway.
in a more, no straddling,
but in a tame way.
And ultimately, they were right,
in terms of... I think you said it.
In the '40s, you just want that to be
a little different in terms of...
I think it's important to
acknowledge the fact that it was there,
but it is a different style of film,
you made two films.
And you wouldn't have a sex scene
in Gone with the Wind, for example.
That would be ridiculous.
A sex scene completely counters the style.
So, it was important, I think, to stay within
the style that you were establishing,
which is good.
I think it works the way that you left it.
I think it was just enough but not too much.
Yeah, yeah.
And here is that these guys
are now on their second date,
and because of Ira's
influence on Sophia
and also a little bit on Luke,
who was there for the story...
- The World War H story.
- Yeah.
These two's given a second chance
and now opening themselves up.
And it goes with the line, with him saying,
"I like you because you're different,
"because you're not different.
You're not like everybody else.
So, this shows these two guys
moving in the right direction.
So, now you have B-story
completely influencing A-story,
and, also, at this point,
the audience don't quite know
how they're going to
converge together.
Which is what I love, is that
we're staying ahead of the audience.
Yeah.
But then again,
we got these little clues.
You see her just pulling Luke along.
It's the same thing with Ira.
It's just Ruth pulling
Ira on the dance floor.
We'll see that again
as Sophia's pushing Luke
to jump in the water.
The one thing I love is that the women
in the film are really pulling the guys.
The guys are a step behind.
As it happens in real life,
most of the time.
No offense, yeah.
But that's pretty much the truth.
Yeah,
you guys are more...
Ruth and Sophia has more culture,
understand more art,
has more worldviews.
Ira's the guy who's in the back store
of a clothing store where he works.
He makes suits.
Luke is a professional bull rider.
Never even went to college.
Yeah, but they...
They have their own identity
and their own culture.
Which is great.
I think they...
It is just as profound and just as...
I think in that previous scene,
in the date scene,
she captures it perfectly, where she's like,
"I wish I had roots,
You have roots.
"You really know a lot
about this one thing.
Whereas she would maybe know
a little bit about a lot of things.
So, it's just a different
kind of attitude to life,
which is so amazing to bring together,
I think, in both instances.
So, that's the connection
with Sophia and Ruth,
that they're from two different places
but they have very much
the same attitudes
in their respect for their man
and how they lead their man
and what they do for the man in the story.
This is, I think,
one of the funniest scenes in the film.
Wait, just, it's coming up.
It's coming up soon.
I think it's one of my favorite
Scott Eastwood moments.
Here it is. Look at this.
- Come on.
- Look at the...
- Look at her, you could see...
- Wow, I mean...
Nobody could get away with that
except Mr. Eastwood.
You can see Sophia
about to laugh over there.
It is just
a priceless moment.
Did you ask him to do that or was that
something that came naturally?
That's something
that came naturally there.
Of course it did.
You can't ask someone to do that.
It would never occur to anybody
to ask somebody to do that.
This genuinely cracked me up.
Because it's perfect timing,
it happened so quickly.
- Yeah.
- It happened so quickly.
She's just...
And you know what's happened.
So this is a really great set
that we just fell in love with.
We just felt at the time
that Luke probably,
even though he lives with his mom,
that he probably would have
moved out of the house
and probably moved into
the barn next door.
And we wanted to really show
that he's a guy, too,
who's very artistic with his hands
and you see all these little, small things
that he probably would have built.
That he's a person who got his...
The colors on the windows there,
of the bathroom.
- He's a guy who's creative.
- There's more to him than meets the eye.
Yeah. So then, what we imagined,
just a regular cowboy.
Yeah.
Again, we go into the sensuality,
bringing up the heat...
And I love that she casually
leaves the door a little bit open.
- Yes.
- And then looks surprised
when he's looking. Come on, Britt.
There you go. Now you're being honest.
Now you're...
And it's just really hitting that moment.
It's just slowly slowing us down, slightly.
And just her looking deeply at him,
it's finally this connection.
Audience has been waiting for it.
And this is her taking a step.
Yeah.
I wanted her to be the one
to make the decision
and even leading his hands.
Her hands come up for him.
I think he also gets
a really good balance between
absolutely terrified, really turned on,
and knowing what's at stake here.
Yes, Yeah.
So, I think you got a really good
performance out of both of them.
And we have a great score
here where Mark [sham did a great job.
And this is my third film
working with him on.
David Tattersall did the...
David Tattersall's a genius.
Did the lighting here,
the cinematography for me.
We came up with this device,
device using color, real time.
Again, we're looking at
the PG-13 short version.
The MPAA really honed this down.
This scene was a lot longer.
These guys gave it all.
And when I mean "all,
it was all out there.
Oh, really?
But at the end of the day,
I think we have what we needed
to make what we wanted to get across.
Yeah.
And we feel that these two
have a sexual energy,
but more importantly, they are
emotionally connected to one another.
This is brilliant, how..
The innuendo of the bull.
I mean, if I was a guy and I was trying to
get some girl to fall in love with me,
I'd be like, "Yeah, come and sit on
my bull for a second. On my bull.
"I'm gonna just rock this
backwards and forwards casually,
- try and throw you off.
- Right.
So how do you know
which one you're gonna get?
You don't.
You pick from a bowl.
And the fan favorite
from Walkertown, North Carolina...
Luke Collins!
Number four is the chip you selected...
It was really Sophia entering
into Luke Collins' world.
She's there to support. She's there for him.
And also, as they're getting closer
in terms of their relationship,
we see how he travels
and how that whole
bull riding circuit really works.
So, this sequence always stayed the same,
and I think it just gave me
a really good idea
to really put energy
into the bull riding style,
and also to educate the audience
on how bull riding works.
Even though you got the sexuality
and romance between them,
but you gotta hold your hands up,
you can't touch the bull.
- And he describes the bull...
- And she's terrified for him.
And she's terrified at the same time.
So, there's a lot of
different things going on,
but the great thing is
we got this great song,
and Mark lsham's score bridged
everything all together here.
But yeah, there's the sexual...
But it's really good editing,
actually, between the bull and the bull...
Her on the bull and him on the bull.
- I really like that, actually.
- Yeah.
It's really subtle,
and I hadn't picked up on it before,
but now I'm looking at it, and it's like,
"Actually, this is the perfect montage.
Well done.
I didn't even realize it was a montage.
- Great. That's great.
- It's perfect.
And it's such a fascinating world.
The bulls are like...
They get treated...
They're gods to those guys.
- These guys are rock stars, yeah.
- They love the bulls, They either...
They call them athletes,
which really confused me at first,
cause I didn't realize
the vocabulary.
When we went to Vegas, the PBR,
I didn't understand the vocabulary.
So when they were talking about
athlete Bushwacker,
I was like, "Wow, who calls
their son Bushwacker? This is terrible.
But it turns out
they were talking about a bull.
And, yeah, they really have
an amazing relationship.
It's like a real...
It's a beautiful expression of
the relationship between man and beast.
Yeah, yeah.
And actually,
these bulls have a better life
than a lot of American people,
I hear
Yeah, yeah.
- Was Bushwacker in the film?
- His name was.
- His name was in the film.
- Yeah.
- Only by name.
- Only by name.
- Cause he had a run of 42 buckoffs.
- Big run, big run.
I think he just retired,
They just retired him.
They just retired him.
That was the last run
that we went to see in PBR.
Yeah, they gave him a little...
He ran around the ring
and they gave him a big retirement party.
And they did a...
They showed a little film
of where he'd lived and things.
Bushwacker had a pimpin' lifestyle.
I'm like, "This bull has a good life.
What a bull."
No wonder he's so...
- No wonder he's so winning.
- Right.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Marty Bowen, I think his wife
is giving birth today.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yep.
But we had some
really cool people working on this,
with Wyck and
my business partner, Bob Teitel.
Mr. Teitel.
Missy Imperato
really did a great job,
- cause this is a big schedule.
- Yeah, Missy was great.
And I remember this particular
scene here, Black Mountain.
I remember when we found this location,
it was just...
Which we talked about in Winston-Salem.
But Black Mountain, let me just tell you,
when I first started the movie,
I didn't know anything about art.
- I was mostly like Luke in the story.
- Yeah.
I just didn't know much
about Black Mountain College
and when I started doing research,
it was pretty amazing,
and I saw these pictures and I was like...
I wanted to create the same thing
in these pictures like here.
Just seeing these individuals
on the side painting right there.
This is a real painting.
This person right here in the suit here,
that's the real deal,
what I saw in the actual photo.
I actually got these guys down to a T
with the wardrobes
and what they're doing with the dancing.
- These are photographs on this pier here.
- So amazing.
These are real pictures
that we just emulated.
Yeah.
So, I wanted to capture
the spirit of Black Mountain,
cause I thought it really
tapped into Ruth's spirit
and why she loved art
and why she loved life as much as she did.
Yeah, it's amazing
when you see an art lover, actually.
My sister's an art historian,
and when she takes me to a gallery,
I really get a little glimpse
of what it means to love art.
It's a really profound and
sensory experience for some people.
I mean, I love it,
but I don't get it in that way.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I don't get it in that...
A couple of times
I've seen paintings, particularly in Italy,
but never with modern art, curiously.
And, actually, you're right.
Learning a lot about Black Mountain
in this film was great.
Such an opportunity
to learn something new.
Yeah, we used a lot of guys
like Franz Kline, de Kooning.
- Jacob Lawrence, we used a lot of his art.
- Yeah, that's right.
Josef Albers.
You saw Josef Albers in the opening...
- Yeah, he was giving the lecture.
- The lecture there.
That was a real speech
that he actually gave.
- Pat Passlof.
- Yeah, to choose this painting.
- Yep.
- Choose this painting.
And Mark Rothko, as well,
went to Black Mountain.
Which is nuts,
'cause you know all these people,
but you don't really associate them
with one school.
And it was interesting, too.
I found out that Robert De Niro, Sr.,
you know Robert De Niro,
his father went to Black Mountain.
- No way.
- Yeah.
So, we actually called him up
and got his name on the invitation
that Ira hands out to Luke and Sophia.
Wow, that's so great.
So great that these guys
were all here at one particular time
- and really making history.
- Making history.
That was pretty amazing.
And it was in North Carolina.
- Wow, it's pretty amazing.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's almost too easy
for Nicholas Sparks.
He happens to want to
make a film about art,
and he googles "Artists, North Carolina,"
- And... Boop! There it is.
- There it is.
Black Mountain College.
It exists, that's the story that he tells.
He was like, "I had no idea
that Black Mountain College
was in North Carolina.
"And then I googled it,
and then, there it was.
I was like,
"That is just so unfair.
"You've already
got all these stories
streaming through you.
"Now you've got all of the set
coming together as well?
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's perfect.
- So, this is a question I have for you.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are those actual photos of Scott?
- Yes, they are.
- Yes? I knew it!
- They are, Yep.
Of course he had a cowboy hat
in the bathtub when he was little.
I think Scott Eastwood is actually Luke.
- What do you think?
- I think so.
And we jump in time, too.
We start in 1940 all the way up to 2014.
- That's a big chunk of history.
- That's a big chunk of history.
We did a lot of makeup for you.
- Eventually, we decided to not dial back.
- Yeah.
And not really spend...
Even with Alan playing in his 90s,
we just felt like,
just play it as naturally as we can.
Do little subtle makeup changes
here and there.
Starting, I wanted to be more radical
and be more,
"No, she's gotta look like this in the '60s.
In the '70s, she's gotta look like this.
But eventually, we felt like
we didn't have all the time
to really do the makeup
the way we wanted.
Two, it was very hot
- down there in North Carolina.
- Oh, my goodness.
So, makeup was a problem.
Literally peeling off my face.
It was pretty scary, actually,
at some points,
where you look at yourself
in the mirror and you go,
"ls that leprosy?
No, that's just my makeup.
It's fine, it's fine,
guys, it's fine.
So, really, we just relied a lot
on slight, subtle makeup,
but mostly your hairstyles.
You had really...
With wardrobe and hair.
Well, it's a film.
You know it's not real.
Yeah.
When you go to the theater,
you are so willing to suspend your disbelief
when people are changing the set
in front of you,
and you're still involved with the story.
So, I think it should be the same in film,
in many aspects.
If somebody tells you
that they're 45, they're 45.
Yeah.
Are you sure that you wanna
go to this gallery showing in Charlotte?
You want me to, right?
Of course.
And here's the point where
we're coming to the place of the story
of Luke and Sophia entering,
"How do you make a relationship work?
Once you have that commitment
and once you realize that
all that early honeymoon part
of the relationship is over,
how do you complete it?
How do you make this work?
My way, I was able to connect
to the story very early on,
and I was telling Elizabeth Gabler this,
who's the president of Fox 2000.
In '91, I think I was a production assistant
on a commercial in Chicago.
And my wife, we were just dating.
I was only maybe 22 at the time,
and I was working at nights
in this production assistant job.
And then this
60-year-old lady comes out
and she says, you know what,
I just had an argument
with my husband on the phone.
"I love him,
but sometimes I can't stand him.
Sometimes I fall out of love with him.
Sometimes I love him more.
Sometimes I don't wanna have sex
with him for a long time.
Sometimes I wanna just have sex
with him right now.
You know what,
that's a part of relationships.
It goes in and out,
It's just a long ride.
This is what somebody told me in '92.
- It's a long ride?
- It's a long ride.
So when this script comes across me,
I was like, "The Longest Ride?
- That sounds familiar.
- That's awesome.
- And I felt like, "Okay...
- That's so crazy.
And I was like, I felt in the script
there was something that was just missing
in terms of what "the longest ride" meant.
And Nicholas Sparks
always had it in the book.
So, I was able to put that word
back into the final voiceover
that Alan Aida has for us in the movie.
He says, "You know, the longest ride
is this thing called life.
"It's really not about riding a bull.
It's about life itself.
- Yeah, it's not eight seconds.
- Yeah, it's not eight seconds.
And that's what I feel
would really make relationships work.
As much as we may have heard it
this many times before,
the true honest thing about
making relationships work and love,
as Alan says,
it's about adjustment.
Yeah. Being agile.
There you go.
Being compromised. Being open, you know?
- Flexible.
- Flexible.
Those are the words. And here it's just...
- And paying attention.
- There it is.
Paying attention is so important.
And here's the
moment where Luke is
not being any of those things right now.
No, he's not
paying attention at all.
He's being a bit of a...
So, in his...
Looking at the squiggly lines,
that's how many people may feel,
and sometimes my wife may have
thoughts and things
that's important to her
and sometimes you'd be like...
I don't understand
what you're talking about.
And sometimes
I gotta stop myself
and sometimes I lose it,
I don't stop myself in saying,
"That's not important to me.
So, why should it be important?
So, this is something
that we all are to blame.
And that's what's
going on with Luke,
is that for a guy who just knows bull riding
and lived in North Carolina his entire life,
this makes him a little bit...
It frightens him a little bit,
this whole another world.
Well, it makes him feel like
he's not in control.
- Yes.
- And that's something that I think
this guy, in particular,
but I think people in general
are very afraid to lose control.
And when you feel out of your depth,
it's very easy to become defensive,
which is exactly what's happening now.
Actually, I spent two mornings
with Alan Aida in New York.
I was doing the press junket.
And I think I learned more about love
in those two days
than ever in my life before,
cause he's just so wise
and 58 years married.
- A long time.
- Which is twice my age.
Yeah.
- Nuts.
- That's nuts, right.
And there they are,
still at it.
And he just has
the most beautiful comments,
like, being agile and flexible.
I'm like, "Yes."
- It's like a sport.
- It's like a sport.
- It's like gymnastics.
- There you go.
And seeing that these two
are having issues in trying to move forward
and we'll see what
the bull riding's setting up.
What bull riding's gonna do
and how does that come between them.
Who she goes to,
the only person she knows to talk to...
- Is Alan.
- Is Alan.
And now we'll see how B-story
is going to educate us,
the viewer and Sophia,
in our A-story,
which just goes into the conflict of what's
gonna happen between Ira and Ruth.
Which we get into the idea of,
finally, it's catching up to Ira
that he's not able to have kids.
Well, that's the wonderful thing
about this movie,
is that it takes you through
the whole journey from beginning to end.
So, you get to see the bad months,
maybe even years, of just
things aren't as good as they used to be.
And then you have to
ride the wave a little bit.
Yeah, I think this was the
first day we ever shot this scene right here
- Yes.
- First day, I thought...
- It was the first day.
- Yep.
The first day, let's bring
200 kids in, That's a great idea.
And I always love this,
I cut out right before you look back.
- Yeah.
- You just felt him there.
And then later, we revisit that
when you actually look back at him.
Yeah, that's true.
But here with the kids is now
Ruth wanting other things
after being settled in the job
and in the house.
- Yeah, teachings not enough.
- Teaching's not enough.
And she cares
about these kids.
I think she's got quite a good
relationship with them.
- I liked those kids.
- Look how good they are, these kids there.
Yeah.
Mean.
If anyone teases him about this,
they'll have me to deal with.
That's one scene where
the Austrian accent really helped.
It does makes me sound stern and scary.
Yeah, exactly.
Good morning.
This was a hot...
I think this was the day that
my face was peeling off.
Yeah, your face
was peeling off this day.
This poor kid.
Daniel had to look at me
and pretend to be really friendly with me,
and this boy Floyd who, by the way,
was just so great on set.
He was looking at me,
terrified,
cause he was like,
"What's happening to this woman?
Her face is melting, She's all scaly.
What's going on?
Oh, dear.
I just love
that I slowed this moment down,
because I just felt like
just you taking in the joy
of what it means to you
to at least have a kid around.
Yeah. Be able to nurture,
cause that's what she wants.
- She wants to nurture.
- Yeah.
She wants to nurture someone
and help them grow.
Look at this kid. He has no idea
what the hell is going on here.
- Where am I?
- Right.
Why did l...
What have I done to deserve this?
Yup, this was a particular...
This was a really,
really good scene to be in.
Because George got really excited
about this kid eating on set.
He was by the monitor,
by the camera,
and he was telling Floyd, for that close-up,
he was telling Floyd to eat.
And he was like, yeah, yeah, okay, now.
Yeah, now eat that.
Okay, now eat that,
No, no, no.
"Okay, just carry on eating,
just carry on eating.
George, I think, was more invested
in the eating than Floyd.
And Floyd was just there
stuffing his face, but, okay.
And I was so impressed with
how much this little boy ate.
He ate, Every single time,
he ate.
But I was particularly impressed
with how passionately
you could feel about it.
Oh, man.
Look at this.
The North Star, Polaris.
Now we just look at Star map
on our phones.
We just download the app.
We don't need one of those.
Again, using hairstyles
to jump periods a little bit.
Also, he was able to burp really nicely.
- Yeah, burp on cue, Floyd.
- Right on cue.
He did it right on time, every time.
I love Jack's face in this one, by the way.
Happy little family.
Yeah, the hairstyles
were amazing.
- Colleen was just incredible.
- Yeah.
She had me ready
in under 10 minutes every day.
And with my hair,
it's always a bit of an issue
to get me ready in the mornings,
because it was all wigs.
There we go. That's a state secret
that you now know, those of you watching.
- All your hair was all under there?
- Yeah, my hair was all under there.
That was the first thing
you said, Can't cut your hair.
I'm like, yeah, I'm not
cutting my hair, Just put on wigs.
Cause in the North Carolina humidity,
my hair would not stay straight
for five minutes.
Not curly, rather,
It would just go straight.
So, it was amazing to have these wigs.
And she was so fast
and so good and so chippy.
And I absolutely love this woman.
And then there was Ken for makeup,
who somehow tried to
make us look 17 and 45.
Yep, yep.
I love this look that
you give him right there.
Just that look of distance there.
- I hate him in this scene.
- Yep.
So, then we set up the first clue
that the picture's gone,
which is the picture
that Luke brings back to Ira.
And the picture that's gonna
come back years later,
- for the older Ira.
- Yeah.
But this was... It's gotta be
100 degrees right now right here.
And this is the scene
where your face is peeling.
Yeah, if you pause
it right around here,
you can probably see
some of my face peeling.
But it's all makeup, I guarantee.
- It's not scabies or leprosy.
- Yep.
Yeah, thank God
for visual effects now, We can clean that.
Oh, really? Did you clean it up?
I couldn't notice at all, so I think...
- Yeah, we cleaned it up for you.
- I was looking out for it.
- I was like, Let's see what they did there.
- Yeah.
But I'm so impressed
with Floyd in this scene,
because he actually was
trying to hold on to me
- as opposed to trying to run away.
- Yeah.
- No, he was really good.
- Yeah.
And these guys were great as well.
What were their names?
- These guys were awesome, these two.
- Yeah, they were great.
These guys were
from North Carolina,
and that was your first time.
We didn't rehearse with those guys.
Those guys just came in.
- That was your first time meeting them.
- Yeah.
And they were local actors.
He was an acting teacher as well.
So, we had a really
good actor-y lunch,
where we talked about acting
and how to do things properly
and all these things,
It was great.
And Romain...
- Romain was absolutely amazing.
- Yeah.
- The props guy.
- Yes.
So, this is a scene that I kept
taking in and out of the movie.
- First it wasn't here.
- Really?
Yeah, I said,
"I cannot leave this scene out.
Because it has to show you guys' downfall,
but it was this matter of
am I in one story too long,
and is it time to shift
over to another story?
So, that was always something,
pacing-wise, that we were trying to find.
- Eventually, the motion...
- Yeah, you had to leave it in.
Yeah, we had to leave it in
to really show Jack feeling...
Yeah, But also
that this whole situation
was actually having an impact on them,
- on the way they felt about each other.
- About each other, yep.
That's the important bit about this story,
is that they manage to
eventually overcome this.
Yes, Yes.
He was so good in that scene.
And the food was good.
Another shout-out to Romain Gateau.
Romain Gateau is his full name,
which makes me laugh,
because it's "lettuce cake.
- And the food was good?
- Yeah, the food was really good.
And they were all cooking in the back.
The food was great.
The props were always there.
And this guy is out of this world.
I love him,
I love this man.
He was the one that was there
in the PBR finals in Vegas.
And he is so incredible,
how he's got this much energy.
- He really knows his audience.
- Yes.
- And he really makes people laugh.
- Yep.
But he's also a really, really
talented singer and dancer,
- which is crazy.
- That's awesome.
So, all these guys you see
are the real guys that PBR use.
These are the real fighters
who are there to help the bull riders out
in case they get in trouble,
make sure the bull
gets out of the rider's way.
Look at that,
These guys get really close in.
Like I said, the PBR was involved
with this film all the way.
They made everything possible for us
in terms of the advertising you see,
Cooper, all that stuff,
and the colors, the scheme.
This is all real,
These are their real bulls.
These are top bulls that they use.
That's really Scott Eastwood.
That's Scott Eastwood there,
laying down.
And these are the real fighters,
and these guys were awesome.
Without them, this would have been
very tough to pull off.
And it just feels very authentic.
Jack Daniel's.
Look at all... These are advertisings
that these guys brought to the table
and just making it feel real for us.
And this guy's great,
Tiago, right?
- Yep, yep, yep.
- That's his name?
- He's really good.
- Yep.
He's only in it for a little bit,
but I really like him.
He has a really strong on-screen presence,
and he's got a beautiful face.
That's no lie.
- He's Brazilian, right?
- Yes, he is.
There's a lot of Brazilians
in the PBR, actually.
The PBR bull riding,
it's really big down there.
Yeah, it's huge.
A lot of Brazilians...
- One of the Brazilians took the first prize.
- Yes.
- Was it Da Silva or something like that?
- Yep.
I think it was Da Silva,
Here we go.
This is the moment of truth for Sophia.
When she's about
to go to New York.
And she decides that, actually, she'd just
much rather see if her man was all right.
And I think this is
the first time where
because of Ira 's story
and her relationship with Ira
and because of the time
spending with Luke,
she's able to now think emotionally
and not think mentally,
which, in the beginning,
which is art school, art student,
go into the world of galleries
and let me keep to my goals.
Now she's being able to
follow her heart.
And we're seeing the process
of her character changing.
And it's funny because
it all boils down to caring, right?
So, you can care about art
and you can care about your career
and you can care about money
and you can care about all of these things..
You do have an emotional attachment
to certain aspects of your life.
But you will never be able
to care about anything
as much as you're able to
care about another person.
Yes.
Because that actually,
the fact that it's life for life...
It also happens with dogs,
mind you, and cats and animals.
But there's something about
caring about something that is living,
that is also alive,
that there's a recognition there.
There's a real exchange of,
I don't know, cell molecular energy,
like supersonic megaliths.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know what...
Words, words, words, words, words.
But if you could put a word to it,
then it probably wouldn't be as interesting.
Right.
But, yeah, so she's got
her priorities right now.
Get her priorities right now.
And I do hope Luke is okay.
Yeah, me, too.
Although I still don't
see why he shouldn't
start a PBR in New York,
in Manhattan.
Just buy out a parking lot
and turn it into a bullring.
And turn it into a...
I think, sell the ranch.
Move your mama to New York.
I don't know, get her to,
I don't know, do something.
No, it's not really
gonna happen, is it?
- He's too attached.
- He's too attached.
He's too attached to his environment.
Remember the line he says?
"There's not many cowboys in Manhattan.
Yeah, "There's not many
cowboys in Manhattan.
- That could change though, Lukey.
- Yeah, exactly.
And I like that moment, too,
cause every time he's talking to her boss,
you can just see her cringing,
hoping he don't say the wrong thing.
Yeah, completely.
You can really feel that tension.
Again, here, as I was
explaining, these are the real PBR guys.
That flip that happened
was just by chance.
That happened
while we were shooting,
and I was like,
Let's use that to our advantage.
Wow, That actually
really happened?
That actually really
happened, That is real footage.
And then I was able to shoot footage
- of Scott around...
- Around it, of Scott?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.
That is insane, that they...
- Was the guy all right?
- Yes.
I think he rode the
next week or something.
It's amazing,
This is the thing, right?
In the bull ring, when they were
introducing the cowboys,
the presenter would be like,
on the tannoy.
He'd be like, And next up,
we have so-and-so from this place
and he is such a real cowboy
that he is riding today
"with a broken collarbone,
a twisted ankle,
severely sprained two wrists
and five concussions.
Well done to this guy, right?
Now he's gonna come out of the ring.
And you see him and he comes out,
and he's actually staying on for
more seconds than
I would be able to stay on for.
- Exactly.
- And it's nuts.
- These guys will break their bones.
- They get right back in.
- And they get right back on the...
- They get right back in.
- And that's what Scott was able to take in.
- Incredible.
From body behavior.
The limp that he does throughout the story,
the hands, the way he moves.
- All that just from taking years of pounding.
- Yeah.
Like you say, he's near the end
of him as a bull rider.
He wants to get on top,
He wants to...
The main important thing, his fear,
is he don't know what else to do.
And we were able to see it, the majority
in this scene when he refuses to quit.
Sophia...
Yeah.
Doctors don't know everything.
Are you crazy?
That's a really nice moment, actually,
when he breaks his wristband off.
And it's a really good
illustration, Very good.
Well done,
Well done, George.
It was great, too.
I know Scott was like, You know,
I should wear my wrist, you know?
And I think he was ultimately right.
He would carry that,
forget that it's on.
- And just tear if off.
- Tear it off at the moment of that...
Like, him deciding that
he's not gonna take care of himself,
and he's gonna go off and serve his ego.
You can't expect me to change mine.
Yeah, I thought it was our life, too.
This is what I do.
It's all I know.
It has been a blank.
There was no memory card.
I can't watch you ruin it.
All right,
Now she goes off in a huff,
cause she's like,
That ain't good enough.
I love this woman.
What's her name?
The one that plays the mom?
- Lolita?
- Lolita.
- Yes.
- This woman's amazing.
The next scene that she does,
she has such a mother-son
relationship with Luke.
- You guys nailed that with casting.
- Yeah, she's great.
Although I think she'd be a bit too young
to be Luke's mom, but I don't know.
Maybe that's just 'cause
she takes really good care of herself.
She takes really
good care of herself.
This is, I think, one of
my favorite moments in the film
that just passed, actually, when Alan says,
How was New York?
And his little eyes,
like, this smile.
This smile that's interrupted by this cough.
- Yeah.
- That for me...
Yeah.
He just...
He's such a genius.
And then, this goes into her
wanting to know more about Daniel.
Now she wants to know
how can she fix this relationship?
Yeah.
So, Alan's here.
Ira is telling her the pivotal moment,
the pivotal obstacle
that happened in their life.
We go into one of my favorite
two scenes of the whole movie.
That, you know,
Ruth leaving, leaving Ira.
Yeah.
Which, I think, is really,
really great, what you did in that scene.
I saw this scene in an assembly,
my first assembly cut,
which the editor puts together,
my first viewing of this.
It never changed.
The scene was cut this way
and it never changed.
I never touched this scene.
It just, some
scenes just editorially...
- Just happen.
- Just happens.
And that's what's happened.
You look beautiful there,
The hair.
Love the black,
Even the red lipstick.
The subtleness of it.
Just says that something's going on,
that you were preparing
to go out or leave.
Yeah.
I know it's not your fault.
He was so good in this scene.
It's a shock,
You can't believe what's...
He was so good in this scene,
in this whole sequence,
this whole day that we shot.
He was so, so good.
I think that was the easiest scene
that we shot, weirdly,
because it was the most challenging,
to access that level of...
We're both... Neither of us has
been together that long with...
As long as these two have been together
with our respective partners.
And we're nowhere near that age.
So, how do you access
that timeframe, basically?
- Yeah, yeah.
- That timeframe
and the depth of emotion
that goes with it.
- Yeah.
- But weirdly,
it was just a really, really
easy scene to be in.
- Yeah.
- I don't know.
- It's just as if magic happened that day.
- Just magic happened that day.
Then we went right
inside to do this scene.
And I remember,
Jack and...
You just spoke about it earlier.
This is the scene where
I remember Jack came up to me.
He's like,
You know what?
"I'm just gonna go for it,
in terms of emotion.
Yeah.
Why hold it' back?
That's the main thing
I was thinking as a director.
"Okay, maybe I have it withheld,
I withhold it.
I always felt like emotional scenes
are always best when...
- You play against type.
- When you play against it, right?
But this is one of those moments
where we didn't quite play against it.
No, It just...
But it happened naturally.
No, you play with it.
But I think also,
it's perfect for Ira 's character
and his journey throughout the film.
He is such a solid...
He's always...
He's always underplaying the situation.
Ira, not Jack.
Ira's always on the back foot a little bit,
whereas this time he's really...
This is the moment of truth for him
where he's actually...
This is the most courageous thing
that he could have done,
- and he really steps up to the plate.
- Yeah.
And he lets her go.
And it's so wonderful to see a man
be that brave and that courageous.
- Yeah.
- And that...
That strong.
- Yes.
- Actually.
Even though he's crying.
- Yes.
- He's being really strong.
And this is...
That's what can happen in relationships,
by seeing these two people fall in love
and decades being together,
that one thing can change everything.
And, um, I felt like
that's what chemistry
and two people being together
or two people, two actors...
How do you
make an audience feel that way?
And that's the most...
And that's what made it
a very tough movie, to...
This film became tough to make.
Because you gotta make sure
you'd be in the right tone,
cause you go one way,
"I don't believe any of that.
You mean you don't believe any of
those decades that they're together?
You don't believe
they love each other any at all?
If you do feel they love each other at all,
then you must feel that they...
When he walks away,
you must feel the same thing.
- Yeah.
- So,
all those things before it has to work
- for that moment to work.
- Yeah, completely.
- Yeah.
- They have to be
- a part of one story really, yeah.
- One story, you know?
Oh, look at his hair.
Come here, babes.
I'll do your hair, come here.
Come here,
Let me coiffure you.
Yeah, it's so important
that they came back together.
Cause they, couples now,
they break up
for the silliest reasons, it seems.
I've got friends that have
thrown relationships away
for the tiniest indiscretion
or weird misunderstanding,
or a bad week
where they just weren't connected.
Yeah, yeah.
And they've thrown this
entire relationship away.
And you think that...
I mean, what kind of world do we live in
where there's no sense of
overcoming your obstacles,
where as soon as something
gets hard, you quit?
- Yeah.
- And I think that's something that this...
Look, I'm...
This scene is just...
I think when you
were saying that
some scenes just came easily,
even though they seem on page
to be the toughest?
This scene is a tough scene,
but talking to Alan,
it was the easiest for him, he was saying.
Yeah.
I think he was
saying that all you have
to do is, you're married to someone,
and you just imagine that happening,
and emotionally it's gonna come out.
Yeah, cause he's there
and it's a fear that he has.
Yeah, yes.
And the main thing is,
there's no music there
till the very end of that sequence.
And this, it's all him.
It's great working with him,
former...
Being a guy who does directing,
he does theater.
He does television,
he does film, he does every...
- Just so much skill.
- He does everything.
So, as a director, talking with him,
he immediately grasps things very quickly
or you don't even have to say much,
cause he already knows
what you're gonna do,
- cause he's done it before.
- Yeah.
He knows the language.
He knows
the language really well.
- So, our shorthand was very quick.
- Hmm.
And it was
a very emotional relationship,
in the sense that the material
made our relationship emotional,
in terms of what we
wanted to get across.
Because he had to
trust you so much.
- Yeah, yeah.
- He really had to trust you.
- Because, I mean, for him to go there.
- Yeah.
He was saying that it was,
the whole thing with his Ruthie
waking up or not waking up.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Rather...
I mean, that's such a...
It's a huge...
Like, it's really...
It's a big thing for...
if I imagined my parents going,
it just makes me lose my mind.
Yeah.
So, I mean, you have to
really trust the people
that you're working with.
And you guys have a great relationship.
Yeah, and it was awesome
working with him and doing a voiceover.
We did a lot of voiceover,
as far as finding the right tone.
And here's again the moment where
the picture comes back into the story.
The picture being taken by Daniel
and showing up later in the box
on the floor of Luke's truck,
and then finding itself back.
So, we jump around time passages,
which is what I love,
making the film complex.
But it's very linear, in the sense that
at least it finally found itself back to lra.
And I always felt like
this says something about love,
on the different aspects,
not just on relationships,
but on human beings,
and how we see
and how we view other people.
And how we impact
each other, yeah.
Each other, yeah.
That's the bit
that always makes me cry.
That's the bit that
really gets to me, 'cause...
Why is that?
Um...
I think...
I don't know.
I think it's something that we can
all connect to as human beings,
is hoping..
Hoping that you have
a positive effect on people.
And those moments
where life turns around
and thanks you for the efforts
that you've made.
It's like...
And the fact that you do,
people do remember you
if you've made a good
impact on them.
Yeah, yeah.
And they're grateful even though
they're not Facebooking you,
- or any of that nonsense, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.
They still think about you.
And there's something that is...
I think we all long to be remembered
by the people that we love.
Yeah, yep.
So, that's a really
amazing moment, It's six years old.
This kid probably
hardly remembered her face.
That's why he drew it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can imagine
that whole storyline.
It's like, that's a whole movie
without being seen.
Mmm-hmm, yeah.
- Yeah. And it really gets to me.
- Yeah.
Of course, he had
to die as well, though.
- Yeah.
- Everyone's dead.
This film should be called
Everyone Dies in the End.
Well, here the line is,
"It's only eight seconds, Luke.
- Listen.
- But this girl...
- Could be the rest of your life.
- Rest of your life.
It almost sounds like
a prison sentence, I'm not gonna lie.
Yeah. No,
she's perfect as his mom.
She is such a sassy mom,
and she's got a lovely
feminine quality to her.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah. That's Scott
squeezing out a thought.
Exams, Don't you miss those?
Oh, man, I'm glad
I'm never going back there again.
- Can you imagine that?
- Oh!
You probably
were good at school.
I was good at school,
but exams are horrible.
I think they're..
They should be banned.
Now this,
she's really good here.
I felt like she really got the, um, feeling,
like it must be...
She's just made the connection
with this guy.
- Yeah.
- She's just made this connection.
It's funny how you meet people
and they can become so important to you
- so quickly.
- So important, yeah.
I remember this moment, too,
cause this is the moment where,
in this day,
I think a lot of people
from Fox came down.
And Britt was about to do the scene.
And I think it was
a lot of distractions or something.
Something was going on,
on the campus.
This was actually
Wake Forest University.
So, something was going on
and it was just hard to concentrate,
and we did about
nine or 10 takes of this.
And she was concerned
she wasn't getting it.
I was like,
"Fox said you had it in take three.
Yeah.
And it's really
about emotionally...
She's able to very emotionally, quickly,
get to where we need to get to.
- And...
- Was that one shot?
That was...
No, it was a combination of two shots here.
All right, But two shots though,
that's still really impressive.
Yeah.
Here's all PBR.
- Look at this PBR guy.
- This is stuff that
you've added since
the cut that I saw,
and it's great, cause it really
gets you into the world a bit.
Yep.
- Look at those beautiful beasts.
- Yeah.
Oh, my goodness.
Such power.
It's funny that, um...
It's funny that he goes, really.
I think it's important that he goes,
because he's also making a...
He knows that she's
gonna be there.
 He knows
she's gonna be, yep.
He knows that
she's gonna be there, so he's like...
Yep.
Again, it's like one of the things, too.
The simplicity of the story,
which is...
I think it's always true when they say,
"Simplicity always wins.
- Yeah.
- It's just two people, right?
The story is two people
who can't quite just...
Can't quite get
rid of each other.
Yeah, it's just very simple.
And also, I remember talking to Jack
early in our rehearsals.
He's like, "I just love the simplicity
of just me not having kids
and how one small thing... Which is
a big, emotional thing for two adults.
But it's one small thing
that can affect the whole.
- Yeah.
- And this...
And the small thing is what we have
in our life and what we deal with.
And that's what makes things human.
How do two people, who cannot have
children, want to have children,
how are they able to
survive that ordeal?
Or how can two people who love each other
want to do two different things?
How would they overcome that?
Two simple things in life.
And just embracing those simplicities,
you can really understand characters,
- and understand behavior through that.
- Yeah.
And I remember
that was something
Jack was saying in
our early rehearsals.
He just loved the
simplicity of just Daniel.
Just this one obstacle that is...
Just becomes massive.
- It becomes massive.
- Yeah.
Because when you're
watching your story for a while,
we see you guys falling in love,
we see you guys
connecting and dancing.
We see you guys
getting married, every...
It's a moment of feeling really great,
and then it's just... yeah.
Yeah, and we see
Ruth as well going,
I know what I'm doing,
this is gonna be fine.
- This is the right choice to make.
- Yeah.
And of course...
Yeah, Alan Watts is one of my heroes
and he talks about marriage,
like, early marriage.
And he says quite a few
funny things about it.
But he's like, How can two people that
don't know what to do with their lives at 19
stand in front of a priest and say
'I'm gonna love you forever?
They haven't figured out
who they are themselves.
How can they sit there and honestly say,
I'm gonna love you forever?
And then people expect them
not to break this promise?
And I think that there is that innocence
to what Ruth does.
It's like, I know what I'm doing.
It's gonna be fine.
I love him more than
anything else in the world.
- And that kind of thing catches up with you.
- Yeah.
And when those moments
catch up with you,
that's when you... That's when
the real decision really gets made.
- Yes, Yes.
- I think.
When you're dealing with
the consequences.
- The consequences, exactly.
- Yeah.
Exactly.
So here, we're in the final bull ride.
We did shoot two other sequences
before this where we see Luiz,
and then we see other bull riders
actually riding while Luke is preparing.
But I wanted to keep
the narrative going with Luke.
I just felt, "Let's get Luke going,
and stay in his head at this point.
Because it becomes about...
Sophia is in the back of his mind,
so, still, I wanted to
keep her connected.
So, I decided to out those other sequences
and go right back to Luke.
This sequence was interesting.
I knew we had to
go all-out for this one.
This sequence was combined,
with a combination of six cameras...
Seven cameras around.
- What?
- Yeah.
Seven cameras somewhere around the ring
grabbing crowd reactions.
But really doing a lot of speed changes,
fast and slowing it down.
And just going down to
slow motion right there,
getting us into his world,
rght there.
Profiles.
Again, we're using the Phantom here.
Really seeing Luke,
seeing the perspective of body
against muscle against the bull,
going wide, where you see the crowd
and the banner in the background,
seeing the guys behind
him in the chute.
I think it was a very
important close-up of Rango,
making sure Rango and
Luke's story is still there.
Slowing things down again
with the Phantom here,
just really seeing the muscles.
Underneath there's the bell there.
I really wanted to get
very specific and detailed.
And then we go into
the third section of the sequence
- where we go into the score.
- That's amazing, that...
- Was that Scott's face?
- Yes, yes.
Is it...
Did you do that, add it in post?
Yeah.
- Yeah, that's in post, yep.
- Amazing.
Yep. Again,
close-ups of the bull.
Just things like that,
I think, will keep...
High angle,
which we use sparingly.
Keeping Rango in the mix,
seeing the twisting there,
letting the music start heightened.
I think this bull...
This sequence was combined with
about maybe five different rides.
With five different rides,
with six different cameras,
we were able to capture that.
But then you see the fighters
in the foreground.
Look at that slow motion there,
getting close.
And then we ramp back out.
These are...
It took a whole day just to get this,
this sequence.
And I'm really proud of it.
Yes, it's beautiful.
Everybody
did a great job with it.
But then again,
you gotta take away the bull.
It's not about the ride.
It's about "What is the story?
- It's about Luke and...
- And there he is looking for her.
Looking for her
and she's not there.
So...
it has to take discipline in making sure
the external's not taking over the internal.
So, it was always trying to
editorially find the right time
and when to stop this sequence.
I think at one point,
I had it even two minutes longer.
I think Elizabeth Gabler at Fox was saying,
George, that's the longest eight seconds
I have ever seen.
So, I had to cut the sequence down.
- With all the slow-mo?
- Yeah.
That's 16 minutes
of eight seconds, George.
Amazing.
- There he is, passing the baton.
- Yep.
The baton.
Yeah. And here he realizes...
I love this guy
right here, to the left here.
Yeah.
I think he...
I should have kept in his line.
That man, he said,
Did you see him?
He just walked right by me,
like he didn't know who I was.
I cut that out.
I should have kept it in.
Oh, my God.
Why did you cut it out?
I should have kept it in.
Put it back in for the DVD.
There you go.
That's nuts.
So, we pretty much
set up this painting...
This auction, pretty much based off
of an auction that we saw,
that was one of the highest buys
in the United States.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
We pretty much set
it up the same way,
in terms of the art
being stationed on the side and...
It's a thrilling world,
the auction world.
Yeah.
- I've been to a few auctions.
- Yeah?
I've been to auctions,
but nothing like this.
Like, auctions where people are
getting rid of old crockery
and things like that.
Cause I just really like it.
This is like a whole world of that.
People get really into it.
They're feisty as well.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They get fierce.
They have proper fights and stuff.
- I mean, probably not in one like this.
- Right.
Because this is very posh.
But in East London, I'll tell you.
- Yeah.
- They're at each other's throats.
This guy was great, though.
He was great casting, this lawyer.
- Yeah, Howie Sanders.
- Yeah.
He is great.
Cause he, you could see him
really getting along with Alan.
- Yeah, right?
- With Ira.
You could see that
there was a friendship
- and a trust there.
- Yeah.
And this we go back into
hearing Ira's voice.
Then we see you finally turn around there.
And just putting all these pieces together
as recapping,
this is something I always wanted to do,
'cause I wanted to emotionally
bring the audience back in,
to Ira's words and you guys life,
and remember it.
Even though there's a death
with Ira that happened,
I wanted to bring joy,
They still live.
- You guys still carry on.
- Yeah.
And that's why I wanted to
end the sequence there.
And we had a line,
"This thing called life right here.
So, this was brought together
just to keep them alive.
And I always loved the ending here,
just a kiss.
That's just something that
you just did instinctively.
I think I yelled out,
Kiss each other or something!
You guys, this was your first time
really hanging out.
Yeah, this was
the first time on set.
- First time in costume.
- Yeah.
Oh!
Yeah, there's something so beautiful about
a man that loves a woman that much.
Maybe it's 'cause I'm a girl.
And it just gets me
all warm and fuzzy inside.
Amazing.
I have that painting.
That 12-year-old boy
actually did that, right?
Yep. Yes, he did.
That painting
was actually drawn.
- You guys did a contest or something?
- Yeah, I did a contest.
Unfortunately, I cut him.
He had a scene in the movie, too.
I cut him out because
we didn't really need the scene.
It's the scene where you...
It's actually gonna be
in the Deleted Scenes,
- so he'll be able to see it then.
- Good.
It's you
at the ice cream shop.
- Oh, right, yeah.
- And he shows up.
And the kid shows up.
You're looking at kids.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Did it make me look
a little too much like a weirdo?
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Just looking at kids.
The kid chaser.
Whoa!
Whole different movie there.
She'd end up in jail,
not dead.
But, um...
Yeah.
So, that painting,
it was done by a kid?
Yeah, a really great kid.
He's 12 years old.
He did several for me, too,
cause I always wanna
keep pushing the envelope.
Give me something better.
Try this way.
- Try that way.
- Yeah.
He didn't even budge.
He did it every time for me.
It's incredible.
So, when I showed my mom,
at first, though,
she was like,
What?
That's not you.
And then,
about three days later, she's...
And my mom is very special.
She comes up to me and she goes,
Oona, that painting is
you down to a T.
- Which is crazy.
- Wow.
- That's great.
- It's nuts that this kid
- who's never met me before who got that.
- Never met you before.
And it's true. Like, I look
at that painting, It's a little eerie.
I'm like,
"That's...
- Yeah.
- You've got my essence!
"Give me back my essence!
Yeah, he did
a really, really awesome job.
Here's again,
these moments where... Okay.
Always in these love stories,
you get these moments
when they finally come back together.
And how do you play them differently?
It's hard, and trying
not to be cliche.
But I just...
Really, just playing
the internal objective is no longer...
No longer thinking about bull riding,
no longer thinking about art world,
thinking about who I need to be with.
It's just playing the honesty of that.
But another key thing is,
no one ever said "I love you" in the movie,
which is what...
I feel you don't need to say it.
No, you don't need to say it.
You show it.
- You show it.
- Yeah.
And this is where...
I think it was in the script,
in this scene somewhere.
"I love you.
But people say
"I love you" all the time.
- All the time.
- Yeah.
And I think that was things
that just made it a little differently.
And staying away from.
Eventually, they had to kiss.
They gotta get back together.
- There's no way around it.
- Yeah.
Mark Isham music.
We really played it very subtle.
But I love this bit,
where they're like, "Not now.
- Yeah.
- Not now, no, go away.
Yeah.
And he's about to get
the news of his life.
Yep.
And she's gonna be like,
Yeah, okay, now he's got money.
- I can definitely do it.
- I can definitely do it now.
Now he's a multi-millionaire
an owner.
Now I can really be with him.
in Ira Levinson's will
I need to read to you.
Portrait of Ruth may not be the most
valuable painting in my collection...
but it was the most precious to me...
This is amazing,
though, that...
It's the stuff that dreams
are made of, really.
This is what I like about this film,
cause it makes it a fairy tale.
It actually just makes it a fairy tale.
It's like, every...
Like magic.
There's the magic of life in love.
- And how it comes together.
- Yeah.
And everyone...
- These guys are really good.
- Yeah.
She's got great hair,
that girl.
Look at it,
Look at her hair.
She's got great hair.
That is a fantastic head of hair.
I'm gonna guess that
your head is spinning right about now.
Yeah, That's a good guess.
See how Sophia's now
suddenly all over him.
She's been so reluctant.
Now she's like,
Right, okay, I got a winner.
I got a winner now.
- And here we are with all of...
- This is...
- Ira's art that was collected.
- Yeah.
That they were able to have
and open up their own museum.
Luke got a new truck there.
He's got a fly new truck.
That's all he cares about,
the new truck.
Yeah.
It's not very eco-friendly,
but very useful.
For the countryside.
For the ranch.
Yeah.
It's amazing. You should have put
some people in the gallery, though.
I'm like, Who's seeing
these paintings, though?
You need some people
to come and actually see them.
Yeah.
Look at that building.
Where was that building?
This was in Wilmington.
- That was in Wilmington?
- That was in Wilmington.
I never saw that bit.
How did I miss that?
That's a pretty big building.
Yep.
Hi.
- There we go.
- So again, this scene,
which we talked about,
being compromised, right?
- Being open, flexible.
- Yeah.
How's the ranch?
How's the museum?
It was questioned, "Was it too much?
Do they need to say it?
I just felt like,
"Why not?
Yeah, it's nice, cause they said it
a little tongue-in-cheek.
- Yeah, yeah.
- They say it a little tongue-in-cheek,
- which is good, Cause it means...
- Yeah.
You have those moments
when you're a couple,
where you're like,
"Life is perfect.
- Yep, it's perfect.
- Yep.
Yep, well,
people hate us, So what?
- People hate us, so what?
- Cause we're so happy.
Yep.
Everything is perfect.
And now we're gonna go
and read some beautiful letters.
It's great that they
kept that tradition up.
I wonder if they'll reopen
Black Mountain after this film.
- I feel like they should.
- I think they should.
We should start
some kind of petition.
- I know, right?
- To reopen Black Mountain.
- It is so beautiful there.
- And I think
Elizabeth Gabler should be
president of the committee.
She should be the president
of the committee, definitely.
Doing the...
I'm gonna talk to her about this.
- You got to.
- I got to.
And then again, it's...
Here, it's just like I always say,
it's the woman leading the guy,
always making a jump
towards the unknown.
Trying different things.
This is what Sophia
and what Ruth do to the men.
And that's what that line says,
When a North Carolina boy
meets a girl from far away...
Sophia 's from far away.
Ruth is from far away.
Her taking the move
to jump in and...
Again, it's another ideal of two people,
again, trying to...
How we can make the clichés.
If you go, they'll jump...
I love that he takes so long
to get undressed.
Yeah.
And you jump in the water.
- We'll do it at the end of this film.
- Yeah.
Even in the ocean scene,
we made sure we didn't get in the water.
- I didn't put that in.
- Yeah.
- We did do that.
- We did do it.
But it just felt like,
Okay, we've seen that before.
Yeah.
So... And this is
the ending.
This is what the story for me is,
the great journey,
because, again,
outside the movies that I have done,
this is something completely different,
but it's the same thematically.
It's about... It's a human story.
It's about love.
It's about family,
It's about relationships.
And that's the kind of
movies I like to make.
And Nicholas Sparks and Theresa Park,
who are the producers,
also created the material and being...
Allowing us to make the film
that we wanted to make.
- Yeah.
- And embracing the actor...
- Being flexible and agile.
- Being flexible.
- Yes.
- Like any relationship needs.
- Yes.
- Very good.
And Twentieth Century Fox,
I think this is my..
Let me see,
this is my fourth movie with them, um,
so it's always great
making films with them.
And I wanna thank my entire cast.
These guys were awesome.
You guys were awesome.
You were a treat to work with.
It was absolutely amazing.
I've never seen somebody so enthusiastic
every day on the...
I thought I was high energy,
but then I met George.
And that's probably why
I'm sick right now, right?
Yeah, right?
We're both feeling a little worse for wear.
But, hey,
we need our downtime, too.
We need our downtime.
We had a premiere
a couple of days ago,
so we're still recovering from the premiere.
A couple of days ago, yeah.
Um, our crew was great.
We had a great crew.
- Oh, yes.
- I think I mentioned everybody.
If I missed anybody,
I apologize.
Um, great production designer.
Great DP.
Everybody was just awesome. And...
- Great sound,
- Great sound, Also...
Ty Murray,
That's the guy.
- Great bull rider.
- Yeah?
Awesome, a legend.
He was the first guy I talked to,
in terms of preparing myself,
getting ready for, um, boot camp
and talking with bull riders,
so I knew what I was talking about.
So, he was awesome.
And Sean of PBR, he's the guy
that made it very possible for us.
And we had some really great...
Mary Claire,
who did the wardrobe for you.
- You guys were awesome.
- Yeah.
Mary Claire was amazing.
All the outfits were so great.
And Mary Vernieu,
who did the casting.
- Yep. Betty Mae, Mary Vernieu.
- Such a legend.
Legend.

Mary Claire and her crew, Carrie and Bill.
They did an awesome job.
And then, just always...
With the dialect coach,
he was working with you all the time.
Yeah, William Conacher
and Diego Pardo
were just the two most important people
for my preparation, I think,
in the weeks before I arrived
in North Carolina.
Yep. How long...
You guys were working...
For how long were you guys...
Um, we did..
I did about..
I did a good two weeks, I think,
before arriving on set.
And then it was every day on set.
It was every day.
Wow,
And Mark Garner.
You remember Mark Garner,
he did the production design.
He was there.
And so everybody did awesome.
I just wanna thank
everybody for listening.
And I wanna thank you for coming in,
cause I love having someone
doing this with me.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
- Thank you.
- It was my pleasure.
It's nice watching it
without the sound, actually.
