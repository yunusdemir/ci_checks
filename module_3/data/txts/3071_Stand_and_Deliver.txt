Is there
anything missing?
The key to
the ladies room.
Now, exactly where was
the fecal material found?
Back
there in the corner.
You'll know when
you're near it.
Excuse me.
This was mailed to me.
Just a minute, please.
Excuse me, sir.
If you don't have
a telephone,
could you bring in
a gas bill?
We need proof you
live in the district.
Excuse me.
My name is Jaime Escalante,
and I was supposed
to teach computer science.
We don't
have computers.
Mr. Escalante.
We were supposed
to get computers last year.
There's no funding
again this year.
[Bell rings]
I'm raquel ortega,
math department chairman.
We'll be working together.
Nice to know you.
But you don't seem
to understand.
I was supposed
to teach computers.
Where were you
last night?
What do you mean
where was I?
What do you mean?
I was waiting.
You the new teacher,
man?
You the teacher?
Please find a seat.
Hey, teacher!
What are we going
to do today?
Will everyone please
try to find a seat?
For those of you
that cannot find a seat,
please stand against
the wall.
Let's make a circle
and discuss
our feelings, huh?
One body to a desk.
Girl: Could we talk
about sex?
If we discuss sex,
I have to give sex
for homework.
Yay!
Yay!
Stand back,
everybody, please.
Girl: I could get you
fired for saying that.
Could you move back?
Que dice?
Entienden ingles?
Sometimes.
Todos los que
no entienden ingles,
por favor,
levanten la mano.
Please move forward
if you don't speak english.
Todos que no hablan ingles,
pasen para enfrente.
This front row, please
stand up and move out.
I was
the first one here.
I'll find you
another seat, ok?
[Jeers and whistles]
Please be careful.
This is math 1-a.
Boy:
I don't need no math.
I got a solar calculator
with my dozen doughnuts.
The bus is exact change.
No big deal.
Quiet. Quiet!
[Bell rings]
Teacher: False alarm.
Everyone back
in the classroom!
It was a false alarm.
Everyone back
in the class!
It was
a premature bell.
Back in the class.
That was
a premature bell.
Girl: Premature bell?
I thought we weren't
discussing sex in class.
Teacher:
Sit down! Stop talking.
They rigged the bell.
The little bastards.
Tricky.
[Bell rings]
She's looking
good, joe.
Jaime. When you
coming aboard?
I get seasick
in the rain.
You seen my boy?
Yeah, I saw him riding
around here somewhere.
I hear your company's
pushing whole hog into pcs.
I don't work
there anymore.
Jaime's teaching
high school now.
Here's your thingy.
Why didn't you
come to me
if you got laid off?
We're starting
college kids at 30 gs.
I didn't
get laid off.
I want to teach.
High school teacher.
Well, good.
That's great.
This is your job.
I shouldn't have
to tell you.
I know. That's why
I was hurrying home.
You're not even
breathing hard,
you're hurrying
home so fast.
Have a good
night, joe.
Boy:
I want a burger!
Hold the fries,
onions, and pickles!
He looks like
julia child, man!
What you got?
It's an apple.
How much?
What do you mean?
What you got?
Half.
Good.
Excuse me,
my german accent.
What you got?
Missing 25%.
What?
It's missing 25%
that's right.
Missing 25%.
Is it true
intelligent people
make better lovers?
[Class laughs]
What you got?
I got a core.
You owe me 100%.
And I'll see you
inthe people's court.
Everyone, please
open your book,
chapter 2, page 26.
Multiplication
of fractions...
and percentages.
25%.
50%.
75%.
And 100%.
Who's calling
the shots, ese?
You got a slip?
You got a slip?
Ok. You'll have
to stand in the back
until I can get
another desk.
You sit
right here. Ok?
Everyone, please read
the first paragraph
for a second.
Where's your equipment?
Don't got any.
You got to come
to this class prepared.
I do the work
in my head.
Oh.
You know
the times tables?
I know the 1s,
the 2s...
the 3s...
finger man.
I heard about you.
Are you
the finger man?
I'm the finger man,
too.
You know
what I can do?
I know how
to multiply by 9.
9 x 3. 1, 2, 3.
What you got?
27.
6 x 9.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
What have you got?
54.
Yeah.
Want a hard one?
How about 8 x 9?
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8.
What have you got?
72.
[Bell rings]
Want to talk
to you. Wait.
Do problems
1 through 20.
Page 26.
Can I have my book,
Mr. Escalante?
Don't bring it
to class again.
Sabes que, ese?
Don't get excited.
Cut me a "d" like
the otherprofes.
I'll read
my funny books,
count the holes
in the ceiling.
Kick back.
First thing, I'll
teach you some manners.
I wouldn't do that
if I was you.
Might lose a finger
and won't be able
to count to 10.
We've seenvatos
like you before.
You'll be
hurting soon.
Ponte trucha, huh?
I was so worried
that the kids would
know more than me
that I'd wake up
at 5 a.m.,
down my coffee,
and do math tests.
I finally learned
every chapter,
and then they
change the book.
Math you either
love or hate.
You get some problems,
come see me after school.
Thanks, Jaime.
See you later.
Girl: Leave the tickets
at the door, ok?
Can I have
my shades?
You're in love, huh?
Which one, huh?
Let me know.
No. It's all right.
Come on, Johnny.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not Johnny, man.
I know, tito.
Titogrande.
Come on!
[Shouting]
Angel!
Angel, help us!
Stay out of it!
Angel!
Go get a teacher.
It's frank gar-cia.
When I say garcia,
you answer, ok?
Are your friends
auditing?
I audited them
to come with me.
I'mel cyclone
from bolivia.
One-man gang.
This is my domain.
Don't give me no gas.
I'll jump on your face,
tattoo your chromosomes.
This is basic math,
but basic math
is too easy for you,
so I'm going to teach you
algebra because I'm the champ.
And if all you can do
is add and subtract,
you're prepared
to do one thing... pump gas.
Ripping off
a gas station
is better
than working in one.
Orale. I'm a tough guy.
Tough guys don't do math.
Tough guys deep-fry chicken
for a living.
Want a wing or a leg, man?
Who ever heard of negative
and positive numbers?
Negative numbers
are like unemployment.
10 million people
out of work.
That's
a negative number.
We'll need
lots of kleenex.
There's going to be
lots of bloodshed.
Ever been to the beach?
Yeah.
You ever
play with the sand?
Yeah.
Finger man.
Come on, finger man.
You ever dig a hole?
The sand that comes
out of the hole,
that's a positive.
The hole is a negative.
That's it. Simple.
Anybody can do it.
- 2 + 2 =...
net head.
Orale. Answer it.
Come on.
You know the answer.
- 2 + 2.
Fill the hole.
If I had
that on my hands,
I wouldn't
raise it either.
Orale.
A negative 2 + 2 =...
anybody can do it.
Fill the hole.
- 2 + 2 =...
come on.
Just fill the hole.
You can do it.
You going to let
theseburroslaugh at you?
- 2 + 2 =...
I'll break your neck
like a toothpick.
Orale.
Zero.
Zero. You're right.
Simple. That's it.
- 2 + 2 = 0.
He just filled the hole.
Did you know neither
the greeks nor the romans
were capable of using
the concept of zero?
It was your ancestors,
the Mayas,
who first
contemplated the zero...
the absence of value.
True story.
You burros have math
in your blood.
Hey, Kemo sabe todo.
The man
knows everything.
Kemo sabe.
Orale. Ok.
Parentheses
means multiply.
Every time you see this,
you multiply.
A negative x a negative
= a positive.
A negative x a negative
= a positive.
A negative x a negative
= a positive.
Say it.
A negative x a negative
= a positive.
A negative x a negative
= a positive.
A negative x a negative
= a positive.
I can't hear you.
A negative x a negative
= a positive.
A negative x a negative
= a positive!
A negative x a negative
= a positive!
Why?
Mrs. Ortega, I don't
want to be the principal
of the first school
in los angeles history
to lose
its accreditation.
Raquel: I'm not saying
this math department
couldn't improve,
but if you want
higher test scores,
start by changing
the economic level
of this community.
The purpose
of this meeting
is to review
the recommendations
for accreditation.
Any suggestions?
Anybody?
Yeah. I don't think
I should
be teaching math.
I was hired to be
a phys-ed instructor.
As I said before,
we lack the resources
to implement the changes
the district demands.
Mr. Sanzaki,
you must have a comment.
This may not be
the right time, but...
I'm sorry, but I won't be
coming back after christmas.
I got a job with aerospace.
How much money
you'll be making?
Look, we have
the remainder of the year
before we're
put on probation.
Now, if we fail, we'll
lose our accreditation.
Wefail?
You can't teach logarithms
to illiterates.
Kids come to us with barely
a seventh grade education.
There isn't a teacher here
who isn't doing
everything possible.
I'm not.
I could teach more.
I'm sure Mr. Escalante
has good intentions,
but he's only
been here a few months.
Students will rise
to the level
of expectations,
senor molina.
What do you need,
Mr. Escalante?
Ganas.
That's all we need
isganas.
What'sganas?
We will begin each class
with a quiz.
Aw!
Aw!
There will be...
there will
be no free rides,
no excuses.
You already have
2 strikes against you.
There are
some people in this world
who assume that
you know less than you do
because of your name
and your complexion.
But math
is the great equalizer.
When you go for a job,
the person giving you that job
will not want to hear
your problems,
and neither do I.
You'll work harder than
you've ever worked before.
And the only thing
I ask from you isganas.
Desire. A haircut.
If you don't haveganas,
I will give it to you
because I am an expert.
Today is monday.
Tomorrow's wednesday.
Friday is payday...
the weekly test.
There will be
no diagonal vision.
You have 10 minutes
to finish the quiz.
If you finish early,
work on that assignment.
No questions?
Good.
Angel.
Vamanos.
I was said
to go here.
[Chair scrapes]
Nice knowing you.
Have a good day.
Arrivederci.
You're in luck.
Take the seat.
Relax.
Take sominex,
but don't sleep
in my class.
I take that as an insult.
Hello.
Hey, Kemo, man.
I want to talk to you
about the class.
You ain't got a seat.
Don't give me no gas.
That was a mistake.
I'll fly straight.
I got a little problem.
Yeah. Me.
No. Seriously, man.
Books.
The homies can't see me
haul them around.
You wouldn't
want anyone
thinking you're
intelligent, huh?
Maybe I can have 2 books
and stash one at home?
I'll cut you a deal.
I'll give you 3 books.
One... take one home.
One for your class.
This one's broken.
One for your locker
so nobody
sees you carrying them.
Easily understood?
What do I get?
Protection, Kemo.
Proteccion.
Understand?
I understand.
I understand.
The only reason I'm
still in Kemo's class
is because of that, man.
Just don't let her know
that you dig her.
That's the worst thing
you can do with a woman.
I'm pretty fed up
with this teacher
we got.
Escalante's got
a bug up his ass.
Dude's from
South America,
some Nazi
come out of hiding.
Don't you know
what's happening?
Garfield's having problems
with accreditation.
Only the asshole teachers
will keep their jobs.
What if we all decide
not to take this test?
He can't
fail the whole class.
Mutiny. Cool.
[Horn honks]
See you guys later.
Camejo thinks
she's so hot
just 'cause
she datesgabachos.
If we
don't do better today,
heads are going to roll.
I've never
gotten anything
lower than a b-plus.
That's because you take
those mickey mouse classes.
Always get an "a."
Here you got a chance
for a solid "d."
You got 10 minutes.
What's the matter
with you?
I'm not taking the quiz.
You didn't turn in
your homework either.
The goat ate it.
Don't do your homework,
don't got a ticket
to watch the show.
Give her the chair, man.
Chair.
The chair.
The chair.
The chair.
The chair.
The chair.
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair! Chair! Chair!
Chair! Chair! Chair!
All right.
Yeah.
Uh-uh.
The chair.
Shut up!
Get back to your tests.
You got less
than 9 minutes.
Now you're the show.
What's the matter
with you?
You're a top student.
Come on.
3:00.
You'll have to
do it anyway.
[Coughing]
Te vas a quedar calvo
si no te metes la camisa
adentro de los pantalones.
Si. Si.
Mira, huh?
Woman:
Mi Lindo Juanito,
hijo,
dinner's ready.
Come inside.
Hurry up!
Dad?
[Children shouting]
Vamos todos
a la cama.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
In the bed.
Juanito!
Hi, mom.
Kids go to bed?
Yeah.
Papa go to work?
Yeah.
Want me to fix you
something to eat?
Mi hija, could you
please turn off that light?
[Glass breaks]
Aah! Ha ha ha!
Orale, homeboy.
Teacher time, ese.
Oh, yeah.
Angel?
What?
Tell Kemo I said,
"que hubo?" ese.
Oh, shit, man.
Hey!
Factoring. Ok.
Green light, red light.
Anybody? Ana?
[Door closes]
Late!
Late!
Late!
Late!
Ok, ok, ok.
Ok, ok.
Go see the counselor.
Come on, Kemo.
Take woodshop.
Make yourself
a shoeshine box.
You'll need it.
Ok, Kemo. You're
the man, you know.
Why don't you
put them in college
so dumb
taco benders like me
can pick
their vegetables for them,
collect their garbage,
clip their
poodles' toenails.
I may be a sinner,
but I'm willing
to pay for my sins.
One-shot deal.
Go on, sit down.
See you at 3:00.
Go to hell.
I got
more bad news, profe.
I know what I'll say
will trip you out.
Mr. Escalante,
I forgot my pencil.
He can have mine.
Today's my last day.
No, no, no, no.
Gracias.
Bueno,
did you enjoy
yourtaquitos?
Muy bien, senor.
Muy, muy bien todo...
except for one thing...
someone doesn't
know how to add.
She should be going
back to school.
Anita, ven aca,
por favor.
Despierta, mi hija.
Mira, no mas.
Te equivocaste otra vez.
Papa, this is Mr. Escalante,
my math teacher.
Mr. Delgado,
how are you?
Mucho gusto.
A pleasure.
My wife fabiola.
Mucho gusto.
Can you
sit with us?
Sure.
Anita, bring us
a couple of beers, please.
You should get
another waitress.
Ana can be the first to
graduate from high school,
go to college.
Thank you
for your concern.
Her mother works here.
Her sisters,
her brothers.
This is
a family business.
She's needed.
She could help
the family more
by getting
an education.
Ah, probably get pregnant,
wouldn't finish college.
Anita, go help your mom
in the kitchen, huh?
She talks about going
to medical school.
No.
I don't think so.
She should make
her own choices.
Un momento.
Yo soy el padre
de la nina, no usted.
She'll just get fat.
She'll waste her life
away in a restaurant.
She's top kid!
I started washing dishes
for a nickel an hour.
Now I own this place.
Did I waste my life?
I washed dishes, too,
when I came to America.
Good!
Put on an apron,
give us a hand.
Your husband comes
into my restaurant, eats,
then he insults me.
Excuse my husband,
Mr. Delgado.
He just wants
what's best for ana.
She could go to college,
come back,
and teach you
how to run the place.
Professor...
I don't want your money,
and I don't need
your business.
Skip it.
Tip.
He puts hotchilesin his dip
to sell extra beer.
Iora! Iora! Iora!
Kawasaki!
Kawasaki!
Yeow!
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Ok...
everybody,
look at the board.
Will someone
please read for me
what's on the board?
Anybody.
"Juan has 5 times as many
girlfriends as pedro.
"Carlos has one
girlfriend less than pedro.
"The total number
of girlfriends between them
"is 20.
How many does
each gigolo have?"
Late!
Late!
Late! Late! Late!
Ok, ok, ok.
Ok, ok, ok, ok.
How many
girlfriends
does each gigolo
have? Anybody.
You got it,
einstein?
You think
you'll do it?
Juan is x. Carlos is y.
Pedro is x + y.
Is Pedro bisexual,
or what?
I have a terrible
feeling about you.
Kemo,
5x = Juan's girlfriends?
You're good now,
but you'll end up
barefoot, pregnant,
and in the kitchen.
Can you get
negative girlfriends?
No, just
negative boyfriends.
Please forgive them
for they know not
what they do.
Carlos has x-5
girlfriends. Que no?
Que no? Is right.
Que no.
The answer
to my prayers!
May I go
to the restroom, please?
In 10 minutes. Hold it.
Senor Maya. Hit it.
It's a trick problem,
Mr. Kemo.
You can't solve it
unless you know
how many girlfriends
they have in common.
It's not
that they're stupid,
it's just they don't
know anything.
I'm wrong?
X = Pedro's girlfriends,
5x = Juan's girlfriends.
X - 1 =
Carlos' girlfriends.
X + 5x + x - 1 = 20.
So x = 3.
[Applause]
Good to see you.
This stuff
don't make sense.
How does it work
in the real world?
Would it be possible
to get some gigolos
for a practical
demonstration?
No, no, no, stop.
Just kidding,
just kidding.
Wow!
Check it out!
Get out of here.
Please!
What kind of math
is this?
This particular one
that's up right now
is calculus.
You'll get it
in college.
My daughter uses this
program in her high school.
I want to teach calculus
next year.
Boy, that's a jump.
That's ridiculous.
They haven't had trig
or math analysis.
They'll take them
this summer.
Our best students
attend summer school?
From 7:00 to 12:00
every day,
including saturdays.
Yep. That'll do it.
Our summer classrooms are
reserved for remedial courses.
If you want to change,
start from the top.
Mr. Escalante,
don't lecture us.
Our kids can't
handle calculus.
We don't even
have the books.
If they pass
the advanced placement test,
they get college credit.
There are teachers
in this room
who'd have trouble
passing the advanced
placement test.
You really think
you can make this fly?
I teach
calculus or...
have a good day.
Well, if this man
can walk in here and...
dictate his own terms
over my objections...
I see no reason
for me to continue
as department chair.
Raquel, don't take
this personally.
I'm thinking
about those kids.
If they try
and don't succeed,
you'll shatter what little
self-confidence they have.
These aren't the types
that, uh, bounce back.
Have a good day.
Thanks, man.
Kemo, it stinks
like last year in here.
Somebody give claudia
an orange.
Ok, ok, ok. Sit down.
You think
I want to do this?
The japanese pay me
to do this.
They're tired
of making everything.
They want you guys
to pull your own weight
so they can take vacations
on mount fuji.
Kemo, I thought
this room
was supposed to be
air-conditioned, man.
You should think...
cool.
Think...
cool.
Cool.
Think...
cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Out of the blue,
I get a letter
saying I was fired
because
of proposition 13.
I'm down to $936.
I invest 100
in resumes,
and I bought
this suit.
I hit every
insurance company.
My wife wants us to move
in with her parents.
2 weeks later
I get another letter
telling me
to report to work.
Like the suit?
Fabulous.
How about the color?
Welcome back, pelon.
You ok?
Yeah, I'm ok.
You sure?
Yes. I said I was fine.
[Rip]
Uh-oh.
We'll go step by step,
inch by inch.
Calculus wasn't made
to be easy.
It already is.
Remember the good times
we had last summer?
Do you remember when things
were really jumping good?
The good times
are gone with the wind.
It's now the good,
the bad, and the ugly.
Come on. A contract?
You can't trust us
by now?
[Bell rings]
For those of you
making the commitment,
you'll be preparing for
the advanced placement test.
Have one signed
before tomorrow.
We come an hour early,
take your class twice,
and stay until 5:00?
Believe it
or don't.
We got to come
on saturdays?
And no vacation?
Pass the a.p. Exam,
get college credit.
Big deal.
We're seniors.
It's our year
to slack off.
Johnny, will you make
it saturday morning
playing in your band
friday night?
You love scaring us
into doing stuff, man,
but that gets old
real fast.
Hey, Kemo.
You proud of me?
I'm the first dude here.
What's cal-cu-lus?
Mom...
calculus is math
sir Isaac Newton invented
so he could figure out
planet orbits,
but he never bothered
to tell anybody
until this other
scientist guy
told everybody he
had invented calculus.
But the stupid guy
got it all wrong,
and so newton
had to go public
and correct
his mistakes.
Isn't that neat?
For a genius,
newton was an idiot.
Don't worry, mom.
If I invent something,
I'll be sure to get paid.
I hope this is not
an excuse
to stay out all hours?
Trust me, mom.
Sign it.
Boys don't like
if you're too smart.
Mom, I'm doing this
so I don't have
to depend on
some dumb guy
the rest of my life.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You don't
got it signed,
you got no ticket
to watch the show.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Blue eyes,
thank very much.
Elizabeth,
my Taylor.
Sophia, my Loren.
Get a haircut.
Thank you very much.
Get a new Jacket.
Thank you.
Thank you
very much.
Clint,
you forget your gun?
Unfold it.
Hep!
Get out
of the way. Here.
You didn't sign it.
I'm putting school
on hold.
Sign it.
My uncle offered me a job
operating a fork lift.
Saturdays and sundays
are time and a half.
2 years in the union,
I'll make more than you.
Kemo, I don't want
to let you down,
but the money will buy
a new trans am.
Nobody cruises
through life.
Wouldn't you rather design
these than repair them?
You can't even do that.
They got fuel injection.
[Grinding noise]
You'll strip my gears.
Orale, Kemo.
Don't panic, Johnny.
Just watch out
for the other guy.
Right or left?
Where are we going?
Right or left?
Go right! Go right!
All you see
is the turn.
You don't see
the road ahead.
Orale, buey.
Open the gate.
We'll be late.
What are you guys
doing here so early?
We're in Escalante's
class, remember?
Wake up. Drink
some coffee, man.
One, you got
the graph right here.
Two, this strip,
the most important part...
it's the radius of rotation.
That's it.
Anybody got
any questions?
Anybody can do it
as long as you remember
one basic element,
and that's
the element of surprise.
Stay awake
'cause you're waking up.
Bring toothpicks
to pinch open your eyes.
You understand
what I mean?
I was swimming
with dolphins,
whispering
imaginary numbers,
looking for
the fourth dimension.
Good! Go back to sleep.
That's very good.
Ok, any questions?
Yes? No? Nothing?
Ok.
Ok, you should
have it by now.
Ok, what's the answer?
Anybody?
Claudia?
Come on.
We're going backwards.
You're fooling around
too much during the weekend.
This girl needs work
from the neck up.
We'll have to
stay late again.
Aw! Come on.
You know there's pizza,
'cause they deliver.
We can get fried chicken,
hamburgers with cheese.
Jeez, we'll need donations.
You owe me money anyway.
You don't deserve
the grades you're getting.
Where are you going?
You late
for another date?
She's got more boyfriends
than Elizabeth Taylor.
I don't appreciate you
using my personal life
to entertain this class.
Claudia!
Ok, ok.
Everything is
falling apart right now.
My boyfriend's
freaking out...
my mom...
school sucks.
I'm in that classroom
all day, Kemo.
Look at my clothes,
my hair...
I can't even comb it.
I hate my life.
So, what's the problem?
Kemo.
Ponla aqui
en esta linea.
En esta linea.
No, no, no. Aqui.
Calmate, mi hijo.
Esperame aqui.
Si.
Yes. Uh-huh.
I understand that,
but you'll have
to bring him in.
I'm not a doctor.
There's no way.
Hey.
I don't do diagnosis.
Uh-huh.
Look, I'm sorry.
We'll have...
mira.
Could you hold
a moment?
Could we see the doctor
before next week?
Ok. Hold on. Seguro?
No.
Medl-cal?
No, tampoco.
How will you pay?
If we could pay,
we'd go to
a regular hospital.
My grandmother could
catch pneumonia.
Ok. Take a seat.
We'll call your number.
Ma'am, you'll
have to bring him in.
There's no way
we can get around that.
I understand that.
You'll have to bring him in.
Mm-mmm.
Try the short cut.
This is easy.
Baby stuff for boy scouts.
My mind don't
work this way.
Tic-tac-toe.
Piece of cake upside-down.
Watch for the green light.
I've been with
you guys 2 years!
Everybody knows
I'm the dumbest!
I can't
handle calculus!
They have
a better chance
of making the a.p. Test
without me.
Don't laugh.
How could we laugh?
You're breaking our hearts.
Don't do this, Kemo.
How noble...
to sacrifice himself.
Do you have theganas?
Yes!
Should I do it
for you?
Yes!
Say no!
I'm going to have
to get tough.
We'll work right
through christmas break.
The counselor was just
here looking for you.
Something about some
cosmetology classes.
He says there's
3 different levels...
one for boys,
one for girls,
and one for...
go find out.
Please, listen, man.
It's cool.
My grandmother...
clock out.
Game's over. You lose.
You never listen
to nobody, man.
Te crees
el mas chingon.
Adios.
Why don't you
send me some post cards
or call me?
We love you.
Kemosabethis,
cabron, huh?
That guy's got a bigger
problem than you.
Tic...
tac...
toe... simple.
She's a little sloppy
with her homework.
Dad, get off the phone
so we can eat.
No. She's
a top student.
Your father works
60 hours a week,
then he volunteers to teach
night school for free.
Merry Christmas
to you, too.
He's visiting
junior high schools
in his spare time.
Corn and potatoes?
What happened
to thelomo montado,
pique a lo macho?
Jaime, I don't want you
to teach this holiday.
No.
No teaching...
papa...
there's a problem here
I don't understand.
See what I mean?
His own son has
problems with math.
No books at
the table.
Go wash your hands.
[Doorbell rings]
I'll get it.
You see what I mean?
Oh, senora, como esta?
Muy bien.
Senor Escalante,
Angelito tiene
que regresar a la escuela.
El no puede
perder su lonche.
No se preocupe,
senora.
Pasele, por favor.
Mucho gusto.
Mi esposa.
I've seen you do lots
of underhanded tricks,
but bringing your
abuelitato my house
at christmastime?
Come on.
I need calculus
to take me
to a good career.
Something
smells good.
Icaray!
?? On the first day
of christmas??
?? A cholo came to me...??
This is what's given.
We're looking for the area
bounded by the curve.
What are the limits?
Anybody.
0 to pi over 2.
Wrong. Lupe.
0 to pi over 2?
What's wrong with you?
This is review.
I checked
my work twice.
Check it again.
Mine's the same
asgordita.
Don't call me
gordita, pendejo.
It's 0 to pi over 2.
I got
the same thing.
You should know this.
No way!
What's wrong with you?
This is review!
You're acting like
a blind man in a dark room
looking for a black cat
that isn't there!
What's wrong with you?
I don't believe it!
You're giving me
a shot from the back!
[Door slams]
Kemo finally blew
a head gasket.
It's a pen.
Class: It's a pen.
It's a pencil.
Class: It's a pencil.
It's a chair.
Class: It's a chair.
It's a light.
Class: It's a light.
It's a window.
Class: It's a window.
It's in the room
on the table.
It's 10:00.
Class: It's in the room
on the table.
It's 10:00.
Un momento, por favor.
Class: One moment, please.
Oh!
Page 456, please.
Come on,
you guys. 456.
Will you shut up
and sit down, man?
We told him
to take it easy.
It's our fault.
We sit back
and watch
him burn in.
It's burn out.
He brought
it on himself.
He asked for it.
How can you
say that?
You're a wanna-be
choloasshole, man.
[Spit]
Oh, that's disgusting.
You want me?
I'll kick your ass!
All right,
break it up!
Pancho!
Just break it up.
Now, just settle down.
Later.
Settle down, angel.
Now Mr. Escalante
is ok.
He suffered
a mild heart attack,
and he'll be under observation
for the time being.
Mr. Schloss
is your substitute.
Now, out of respect
to Mr. Escalante,
please give him
your undivided attention.
Now I don't want any
more trouble from this room.
All right, pancho,
you come with me.
Angel, let's go.
Tito, take your seat.
Mr. Molina
has informed me
you have your a.p. Calculus exam
in 2 weeks.
I'll be honest with you.
I've never taught
calculus before.
I'm really
a music teacher.
You mad at me,
mommy?
If I thought it would help,
I would be angry.
Dad...
the doctor
says no stress.
No job-related activity
for at least a month.
I want
another doctor.
Jaime, I have to go.
I left Fernando
with a neighbor.
I'll stay with dad.
Go with your mother.
Don't forget to take
out the trash, ok?
Ok, dad.
Come on, mom.
What time do you
get out of work?
Hi!
Hey!
Mr. Escalante!
I'm still alive.
I'm a hard-dying
type of guy.
Shouldn't you be
in the hospital?
I should
be with you.
Bulldogs!
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Thank you very much
for baby-sitting.
Have a good day.
How are you?
Hey, you should be
taking it easy, man.
No, I should be here
with you guys.
I mean, you already forgot
to stand up. Everybody!
No, against the wall
like a snake. Hurry!
We've been practicing
for this all year.
You're the best!
You guys are the best!
This is
a piece of cake!
Upside-down!
And...
step by step!
All right!
You got it now.
Open your eyes.
Y = ln...
quantity x - 1.
What's the domain?
X is greater
than -1.
No! To the end
of the line.
I'm gone 2 days,
and you forget already.
What's the domain?
All real numbers greater than 1.
X is greater than 1.
I told you
you could do it.
Ok!
Be sure each mark is black
and completely fills
the answer space.
If you make an error,
you may save time
by crossing it out,
rather than
trying to erase it.
It's not expected that
everyone will answer
all the multiple-choice
questions.
When you're told to begin,
open your booklet,
tear out the green insert,
and start work.
You may begin now.
Let's go!
Come on! Get in!
Get in!
Oh, no,
it's too cold!
Anita!
Come on, anita!
Angel!
I like to keep my pants
dry, you know, man?
Angel!
Come on in!
Come on!
The water's great!
Come on!
Ok, fine!
Fine!
This is so stupid, man.
I'm coming!
Angel!
Come on!
Come on!
[Rooster crows]
Orale, grandpa.
We, being teachers,
know the advanced placement
tests are very difficult,
especially in mathematics.
Less than 2% of all high
school seniors nationwide
even attempt the advanced
placement calculus test.
You've been drinking.
I am proud to announce
that no other high school
in southern California
has more students passing
than garfield high school.
No. He just
walks like that.
18 students
took the test.
18 passed.
Many...
we have an
announcement to make.
It's all right.
Ok.
We, the a.p. Calculus class,
would like to present
this plaque to our teacher...
Jaime a. Escalante.
Come on up.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
[Telephone rings]
Yes?
This is guadalupe escobar.
What is this,
some kind of joke?
Wait, wait a minute.
Who is this?
For reals?
What?
You're crazy, man.
"It's standard procedure
to grade the test
"with the identity
of the students concealed.
"Only after the
irregularities were found
was it determined the students
were all from garfield."
You all received
the same letter?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Based upon the unusual
agreement of incorrect answers,
"e.t.s. Has no alternative
but to question the scores
of students with
such unusual agreement."
What's it
mean in english?
We copied each other
because we all had
the same wrong answers.
We're too stupid
to cheat correctly.
Why don't
we just sue?
"The board doubts
the grades are valid for you
because of these
unusual circumstances."
These people are human.
They can
make mistakes, too.
Ana: Kemo, these people
are calling us cheaters.
All right.
This is where we keep
all confidential material,
s.a.t. And a.p.
Tests included.
I assure you,
only my secretary and i
know the combination.
Mr. Molina,
this controversy
is officially between
the educational
testing service
and the students.
It does not
reflect upon your school
or its administration.
I understand.
We'd like
to resolve this
with the least
publicity possible.
I'd appreciate that.
All right?
Yep.
Do you think they got
the test ahead of time?
Well, claudia was having
emotional problems.
Pancho was way behind.
Do you really think
anyone cheated?
No, but my father does.
Damn shit!
Look at this shit!
If I'd have taken
that job with my uncle,
I could have had
a brand-new car by now!
It's ok.
You can fix it.
Come on, ok?
Just relax.
Hey, I didn't know
you two were
like a thing now.
Just something
for the summer.
Come on, lupe.
You're such
an asshole, pancho.
Lupe, wait.
Shit!
Lots of stars up there,
homey. Not too polluted.
Stars aren't
really there, ese.
No, what
you're looking at
is where they
used to be, man.
It takes the light
a thousand years
to reach the earth.
For all we know,
they burned out
long ago, man.
God pulled
the plug on us.
He didn't
tell nobody.
Those stars
are out there.
I don't care
what you say.
[Car engine revs]
Hey, homeboy.
Ialli te llevo,
mi hija!
Come on, throw me
a kiss, baby!
Hey!
Hey, tirame un beso.
[Siren wails]
That's right.
That's right.
That's all you know.
What's the matter,
you can't afford a knife?
Use a pencil,
go to jail.
Can I have
this back now?
You got a tough mouth.
You better watch yourself.
Mucho gusto, officer.
Let's go, Jack.
That was
real smart, ese.
Get away from my ride!
Get up.
Come on, get up!
Where are you going?
Come back.
Angel!
Well...
does anyone have
anything to say?
Ana...
I've known
your family for years.
Tell us the truth.
Nothing happened.
Don't lie to me.
Nothing happened!
Just
leave her alone.
She didn't do
anything wrong.
Then tell us who did.
We're not cops.
We're not here to
put anybody behind bars.
If you cheated,
let us know
so you can go home
and enjoy
the rest of your summer.
Permiso.
I come from
this neighborhood.
Yo vengo
de este barrio,
and I know that
sometimes we're tempted
to take short cuts.
Just tell me the truth.
What happened?
Dime la verdad.
Ok.
We're busted.
Why don't we just admit it?
How'd you do it?
I got the test
ahead of time
and passed it out
to everyone.
How did you
get it?
The mailman.
I strangled him.
His body's decomposing
in my locker.
There's no sense
in continuing
if they
won't cooperate.
Do you know how this
got in my box?
A letter
of resignation.
Anonymous.
My guess is it could have
something to do
with the mess
this school is in.
You think
they cheated?
Mr. Escalante,
you put these kids
under an awful lot
of pressure.
They would have gone to
any lengths to please you.
You didn't answer
my question.
All right.
Well...
every night
when I go to bed
I watch
the television news.
I see lots of people
go on trial.
They deny everything,
or their lawyers say
they were insane at the time.
A lot of them get off.
But I believe
that most people
who get caught
today are guilty.
Don't you?
Yep.
I know
what you mean.
Have you
seen my car?
No.
Do you need
a ride home?
No, thank you.
Kemo, let me
take you home.
[Door closes]
Jaime?
Jaime...
want to talk
about it?
Mm-mmm.
I may have
made a mistake
trying to teach
them calculus.
Regardless of whether
they passed that test
or not, Jaime,
they learned.
Yeah, they learned
if you try real hard,
nothing changes.
Quit.
If that's all you
have left to teach...
quit.
You know, what kills me
is that they lost
the confidence in the system
that they're now finally
qualified to be a part of.
I don't know why I'm
losing sleep over this.
I don't need it.
I could make twice
the money in less hours
and have people
treat me with respect.
Respect?
Jaime,
those kids love you.
[Honk honk]
[Honk honk]
[Honk]
Hey, Kemo!
Check out your ride.
We fixed it up for you.
Going downtown, man,
to take action
on those e.t.s. Boys.
Hey, dad, check out
your new car.
Angel: We got to talk
about the payments.
Golly!
Gentlemen?
My name is
Jaime Escalante.
I'm the a.p.
Calculus teacher
from garfield
high school.
Yes. Yes.
I'm dr. Pearson.
Hello, doctor.
This is dr. Ramirez.
Que tal?
Un placer.
Es un gusto,
senor.
I feel I have
the right to know
why you think
my students cheated.
Mr. Escalante,
I'm sorry you drove out here,
but we're not at liberty
to discuss
the controversy with you.
I'd just like to see
the test, that's all.
Mr. Escalante,
I understand what
you're going through here.
But I repeat,
the problem's between
the e.t.s. And the students.
I'd just like to see
what mistakes were made.
I'm their teacher.
I know my kids.
Mr. Escalante,
have a seat.
No. No, thank you.
There were
some unorthodox,
even illogical
computations
for students
of this caliber.
Mistakes
in simple math.
Maybe they made
the same mistakes
because they had
the same instruction.
I taught them
step by step,
all the same way.
Look. Your students averaged
fewer than 4 wrong
on the multiple choice,
where other schools
average what...
14 to 18
incorrect answers?
And most of your kids
finished with time to spare.
They should be rewarded,
not punished.
Mr. Escalante,
the educational testing service
does not act capriciously.
Every major university
in the united states
subscribes
to our service.
I would like to see
proof of wrongdoing.
I would like
to see the tests.
Let me reiterate.
There's no proof
of wrongdoing,
only a suspicion
of cheating.
One is innocent
until proven guilty,
not the other
way around.
If you're so confident
of your student's
abilities,
encourage them
to retest.
Why should I?
If they don't, everyone
will assume they cheated.
Everyone will assume
they cheated if they do.
I want to see
the tests, please.
Mr. Escalante,
we're psychometricians,
thorough to the point
of boring.
We're not out
to get anybody here.
Hold on. If this was
2 students cheating,
that's one thing.
But by making
a blanket accusation,
you're saying
there was a conspiracy.
Every conspiracy
has a leader.
Who better to lead it
than the teacher?
Nobody's accusing you
of anything.
Not only me.
The school, parents,
the entire community.
Scores this high
would be questioned
regardless
of the school.
If this was beverly
hills high school,
you two wouldn't
be investigating.
Mr. Escalante,
I hope you're
not insinuating
that we haven't earned
our position here,
'cause no one's
given me a damn thing.
You're letting your emotions
get the best of you.
If no one's given you
a damn thing,
you should not be taking
away from my kids!
The identity of
the students were concealed
until it
was determined
that irregularities
existed.
Those scores are
only being questioned
because my kids
have spanish surnames
and come
from barrio schools!
You know that!
We've been patiently
explaining our position
and listening
to your complaints.
Now our conversation
is over.
There's something
going on here
that nobody's
talking about,
and you know
what it is!
No one has the right
to accuse me of racism.
No one has the right
to accuse me of racism!
I know well how to spell
discrimination!
I thought this was over
a long time ago.
Are you doing this
to my kids?
There are
2 kinds of racism...
singling out members
of a minority group
andnot
singling out members
of a minority group.
My kids could teach
you a thing or two.
I'm calling security
if you can't
control yourself.
Go ahead.
You didn't
show me the test.
You didn't
prove anything.
They didn't
do anything.
I'll prove
you guys wrong.
I hope you do,
because this is not
between you and me.
Maybe not,
but if I catch
you on the street,
I'll kick the shit
out of you.
Yeah, this is
guadalupe escobar.
I've decided to take
the test again.
You're kidding.
Kemo, we only have
one day to study.
Ok. 8 a.m.
On tuesday. Thank you.
Why didn't you
let me talk to them?
Call collect. Stick
them with a big bill.
I thought I'd seen this place
for the last time.
We'll have to review
the entire course
in one shot.
You mean
in one day?
Can't do it in less.
It'll be the same test?
Mm-mmm. It'll be harder.
Don't count on that.
Just go step by step
and play defense.
Don't bring anything.
No pencils,
no erasers, nothing.
Don't wear clothes
with too many pockets.
Don't let
your eyes wander.
No spacing out.
Don't give them
any opportunity
to call you cheaters.
You are
the true dreamers,
and dreams accomplish
wonderful things.
You're the best.
Tomorrow you'll prove
that you're the champs.
Start with chapter one.
Kemo, what you
making over there?
You like brains?
Good. I was afraid
you guys wouldn't
appreciate it.
This food lasts
for 24 hours.
You're afraid we'll screw up
royally tomorrow, aren't you?
Tomorrow's just
another day, honey.
I'm afraid you'll screw up
the rest of your lives.
I'm fried.
I don't care
if I don't pass.
Sit down. We got
work to do.
I'm going home.
Sit down.
I'm tired, and
I'm going home.
Ok?
You know
what you're doing?
I'm going home.
That's what I'm doing.
This stuff's ready.
Who'd like some?
Kemo, let's
order out, man.
I was just kidding.
Hey, I had
to see you.
You can't expect me
to be your girlfriend
at your convenience.
I'm an asshole.
Sorry.
I'm sure
you're all familiar
with the procedure.
You have 90 minutes
to complete
the multiple-choice section.
Do not fill in answers
by guessing.
Wrong answers will be
counted against you.
You may begin part one...
now.
Ok. Pencils down.
You have 90 minutes
to complete
the free response section.
Don't spend
too much time
on any
particular answer.
Credit will be issued
for partial solutions.
Open the booklet.
Begin part 2.
Good luck.
Finished?
I cannot
finish the test.
I have an
appointment at usc.
It's related
to my scholarship.
Can't that wait?
No, it can't.
Ok. Did you fill out
your I.D. Card?
Yes. Thank you.
Ok...
pencils down.
Mr. Escalante?
Mr. Escalante,
did you hear
the news?
We got
the computers.
Yep. That'll do it.
Jaime, they want to go
over the test again,
make sure there's
no misunderstandings.
Estelle, I'm going
to the faculty meeting.
Thank you.
Misunderstanding
again?
Can you call
dr. Ramirez?
He'll help us.
He's going to tell me
the same thing, Jaime.
All right.
I'll call him.
Icaray!
This is Mr. Molina
calling again.
Yes, I did.
Oh, you do?
Yes. Yes, I'd
like that very much.
Uh... uh...
one moment.
Yes, uh, yes.
I'm aware of the scoring.
3 is a passing grade.
5 is a perfect grade.
Yes. I'm ready.
Go ahead.
Diaz, maria. 4.
Sinfuentes, mark. 5.
Navarra, jose. 4.
I want the original
scores reinstated.
Santos, Daniel. 4.
Escobar, Guadalupe. 5.
Camejo, Claudia. 4.

We're coming with great news.

?? You've got to stand
and deliver??
?? With your body and soul?
?
?? Stand and deliver??
?? Just give me
something to hold??
?? Stand and deliver??
?? If the truth
can be told??
?? We can make it together?
?
?? If we stand
and deliver??
?? Stand and deliver??
?? I know in this life??
?? You gotta stand up
for what feels right??
?? Each day and every night
??
?? You've got to stand
and deliver??
?? With your body and soul?
?
?? Stand and deliver??
?? Just give me
something to hold??
?? Stand and deliver??
?? So the truth can be told
??
?? We can make it together?
?
?? If we stand??
?? If we stand and deliver?
?
?? Stand and deliver??
?? If the truth
can be told??
?? We can make it together...??
