1950, Pyongtaek City
By the way, Sis!
You love Taek-su a lot,
don't you?
'Love'? That sounds absurd.
Then you're marrying him
not out of love?
That's enough!
When you and I were young
- Stop it!
- My love, Taek-su
Really?
Oh my!
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
What are you doing?
What if someone sees us?
Who cares?
What is that?
Is it a toilet or a pot?
- Dae-shik!
- Yes, Master.
Carefully carry this for her.
Of course, Master.
Here we go!
What about me?
Don't run!
You'll regret it if you fall!
You're so lucky Sul-hee.
Shall I get married again?
So...
...my mom rode in this?
That was the best ride
during those times.
Breaking news.
At dawn, the monstrous
North Korean soldiers attacked...
Our brave soldiers...
destroyed...
Citizens, do not be afraid...
What is he saying?
He said that the commies barged in.
But our soldiers destroyed them.
So we shouldn't worry.
I was afraid that Sul-hee's
wedding wouldn't happen.
Don't speak such nonsense.
Don't you know Dr. Rhee Seung-man?
He got a doctorate for
getting rid of commies.
That's not the doctor that I know.
You're just an herb digger,
so you don't know crap.
Whether it's a commie or a Nazi,
he converts them all!
I don't know crap for an herb digger?
One, two, three!
- Don't lift it!
- No!
I told you not to lift it!
Are you okay?
But I've been on a diet lately.
This thing is too weak.
I told you to change
that wooden arm for ages.
But you always pick
those useless roots.
This isn't a useless root.
It's a wild ginseng!
Then it must go well
with those potatoes.
You two will get into a fight.
He's just overreacting.
It's not worth fighting for.
Now, since we're all here,
let's talk about the wedding.
Yes, go ahead.
So you take the bride's gifts.
Suk-ho.
Suk-ho, you take care of the lantern.
How could you stuff your face
when the mayor is talking?
How long do I have
to carry the lantern?
What?
Send me off to get married, too!
Don't worry, kid.
I'll hook you up with Soon-hee.
What is she crying for?
She's no better.
I'm leaving!
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
That silly boy!
Wow, it's so soft.
Nam Taek-su
Mend my clothes out of silk
for my wedding, too, okay?
You'll dirty it!
Put it down!
You're always getting on my case.
That crazy cuckoo is back again.
Don't let the elders see you
and hurry on back.
You sit down.
I told you to sit down.
What if Taek-su does
something bad to her?
So don't interfere and just sit.
You're so blind.
What's wrong?
I'm just worried
before the wedding.
Nothing will happen, right?
You're so cute.
Sul-hee,
forgot who I am?
An Anti-commie Youth Group member.
Don't be afraid of the commies.
I'll protect you,
so don't worry, okay?
What if someone sees?
Who's going to see us here?
Everybody!
We didn't kiss, so come on out!
Are you crazy?
Where are you going?
Forget it!
Sul-hee, wait for me!
Go away!
I almost had a heart attack!
Wake up! There's big trouble!
You have to run away!
What are you fussing about?
Why don't you get what I'm saying?
Seoul is under attack!
You have to run away!
Run away at this hour?
Taek-soo's wedding is in two days!
They're supposedly killing everyone
from the Anti-commie Youth Group.
What?
Taek-su is in serious danger!
I wandered today to the hill,
Maggie
To watch the scene below the creek
And the creaking old mill Maggie
My love Maggie
Now, verse two!
You have to plant it in order!
Like this?
Just do as she says.
What book is she following?
Plant it in a row!
Like this?
Take a look!
We can plant double
if we do it in order like this!
Damn it!
This damn cow keeps farting.
It's more useless than a pig.
Move it!
Mayor!
Taek-su...
His relative from Seoul came down
and took everyone with him
except for us.
What nonsense are you talking?
Rumors that the commies
took over Seoul must be true.
My baby girl!
The wedding is in two days.
But how could he abandon his bride?
What will happen
to our Sul-hee now?
Dad!
Sukjunglee Village
The South Koreans are watching!
Straighten up and walk proudly!
Kim Nam-bo!
Come out!
Jang Dae-shik!
Hurry!
Park Suk-ho!
Dad...
Stay still.
You all must be worried
about us suddenly barging in.
We're not the enemy!
I came for us to cultivate this land
and live together with all of you.
There will be no trouble if you
cooperate like this comrade here.
Isn't that Mr. Baek
from Sodommol Village?
We, the people's liberators,
are here to be at your service.
These proud young comrades
will be volunteer soldiers.
They will obtain the glory to
fight against the American side.
I heard that all the draftees
got shot and killed.
That son of a bitch.
Who is the mayor?
Where are Nam Taek-su
and Nam Joo-sa?
I'd like to know for myself, too.
You bastard!
Answer him right!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
How could you hit an elderly?
Do you want to to die?
Sul-hee! Sul-hee!
Just answer the question.
You disgrace.
You sons of bitches!
Stop it!
That's enough.
What are you waiting for?
Take them away!
They came to liberate the persecuted?
Who here is persecuted?
I can't stand it anymore!
Whether I get shot or not,
I'm going to kill those commies!
So nobody stop me!
Although the men got taken away,
what about Sul-hee?
I'm worried she doesn't get hurt
while being among all those men.
There you go again.
Is this the right time to say that?
Is it because you got widowed early?
You're so immature.
What does being a widow
got to do with it?
I thought you were going
to go kill those commies!
Hurry up then!
What's wrong with you two?
Is this the time to fight?
Hey, did you see Mr. Baek?
He was wearing a red armband.
He must've decided
to become a commie.
His family has been disloyal
for generations.
During all the foreign invasions
or internal feuds in the past,
someone from his family
stuck to the leader.
During the Japanese occupation,
he always wore the Japanese flag
on his forehead.
A kimono is much tighter.
So walk carefully.
I thought he was bleeding
from a head wound.
Are you a Japanese informer?
Eat this!
Are you crazy?
I heard that he was the first here
to change his name to Japanese.
The first here?
Probably the first in the country.
Get out of here, you Korean!
Wait a minute!
The Japanese didn't even force us
at that time.
But he dragged all his family
to the Japanese.
I want to change my name
into Japanese.
And my whole family!
But how could he be fine until now?
He wouldn't have survived
the Independence Movement.
Once he heard that Japan
lost the war,
this time he flapped around
the Korean flag like a mad man.
He cheered "freedom" so much
he was foaming at the mouth.
People said he was going
to have a stroke soon.
Whether it was the Japanese
or the draft,
none of his family was taken away.
Oh yeah, when his grandfather
was suspected of being a commie...
I don't know this person.
He said he wasn't related to him.
Oh, that?
That's my mother's clan register.
My mother had another lover.
I'm a different blood line.
No, my mother had another man.
What can I do about it
if she loved someone else?
I'm his son.
Can you believe that crap?
So now that the commies are here,
he escorts them first?
He probably ran out
and shouted, "Welcome!"
What's wrong?
You get tortured
for supporting the communists.
Grandpa, the liberation you
waited for has finally come.
I was the only one...
Who nursed you until now...
Are you an American informant
of anti-communist teachings?
That picture!
Sukjunglee has been an
anti-communist den for generations.
You don't have things like this
in your village?
Not at all!
1900.4.17 Park Seung-tae,
April 4, 1900
Nam Taek-su, region leader of
the Anti-Communist Youth Group.
He reported many Labor Party
affiliates to the police.
Bastard.
Where's Nam Taek-su?
I don't know.
I would like to know myself.
How is she related to Nam Taek-su?
She was engaged to him.
Everyone gets smarter
when they go into that room.
So tell me where he is.
While living as
the Mayor's granddaughter,
I bet you extorted many people.
Let's go.
That's enough!
What's the use torturing her?
This region is infamous
for persecuting Labor Party members.
Is it the Party's policy
to torture the people?
We came with the duty to collaborate
and guide them to the right path.
Got it?
Then you came here
for the wrong reason.
Not a single person here will
collaborate and help you people.
You see that?
I told you that I was right.
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!
We sincerely welcome all of you
to our village!
Hurray to the commies!
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray to Korea!
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray to the North!
I must've spoiled her.
She was such a nice child.
So you're going to collaborate
with our goals?
- Of course.
- Of course.
Of course we will collaborate.
We have special guests,
so how could you serve this little?
I'm sorry.
The village isn't so well off.
Shouldn't you go kill a cow
for an occasion like this?
All we have is one cow.
So how will we farm
if we eat it?
There's no problem.
Thank you.
Please eat.
Have plenty.
Thank you for the food.
Sir, I was thinking...
It would be cold at night
for you to sleep on the ground.
Of course.
We have a vacant room,
so how about sleeping there?
That's a great idea.
Also, the village grave site
is by the camp.
There are a lot of tombs there.
You'll find it quite unsettling.
There's a grave site behind our camp?
- Yes.
- Yes.
I'm too scared to go over there.
Thank you for the offer.
But nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen?
Something big happened here once.
You see that man over there?
His father fell at the grave site,
and became a crippled.
Rumors have it that he saw a ghost.
Anyway, his son suffered so much
having to nurse his father until now.
He's the most filial son
there could ever be.
It breaks my heart seeing that he has
to leave his father behind to serve.
Now he has to leave things
to his young wife.
If it was me,
I'd die suffering.
And what about my poor Suk-ho?
Right after he was born,
his mother couldn't breastfeed him.
So he goes crazy over food now.
He eats so much,
the villagers call him 'cow'.
Yeah, look at him eat.
We know everything about him.
But do you call that human?
Just think of it as dragging a cow
around in the battlefield.
That's exactly it.
He's a cow armed with a gun.
Your poor mom must be
so worried about you.
You're probably thirsty
so drink this.
What are you doing?
Why are you hitting me?
Who told you to bow down?
Don't talk nonsense!
What's the meaning of this?
- Please sit.
- I'm sorry.
Please sit.
But Lieutenant...
Get up!
Dad!
Min-ku! Honey!
Dad!
What did you do now?
We were setting things up nicely,
but why did you ruin it?
Did you see the Lieutenant's eyes
when I was talking to him?
He looked shocked when I said
that Suk-ho ate more than a cow.
How could they do that to you?
All that they gave you
were potatoes?
You must have been mad enough,
for you to kick the pot like that.
How could they to nobles like you...
I mean, comrades...
I mean, don't you think,
loyal comrades?
Just call us whatever you want.
Really?
It was mistake settling down
in Sukjunglee.
That place is very poor.
Is Sodommul any different?
Of course it is.
The quality of our village
is much different from Sukjunglee.
They're short of working hands,
since so many Japanese killed them.
What are those kids playing with?
Are those cow tails?
We got busted.
Why did they come and play here?
Go play somewhere else.
We have more cows than dogs
here in Sodommul.
Hello, Sergeant!
Go check everything.
Yes, sir!
Did you leave something behind?
What will we live on
if you take everything?
No, not that!
That's my mother's medicine!
That's my mother's medicine!
Sergeant,
that's my mother's medicine!
Take everything that you see!
This is all.
It's everything.
Hello.
Dig through everything!
Worker's collective and sharing is
the basis of the new South Korea.
The food here will be distributed
equally and fairly.
Hurry it up!
What are you doing?
How will I survive
if you share all this?
Are they equally distributing
the women, too?
Really? No, they can't.
Look here!
This is your idea of liberation?
You asked for our collaboration.
What is the meaning of this?
That's right!
I won't have a wife anymore.
If you equally distribute her,
how would this be fair?
If it's intentional, that's bad.
What are you talking about?
These women here will cook
the food for our soldiers.
Is that so?
The leader of the women's
group will be...
Comrade Park Sul-hee.
Are you crazy?
You bitch...
It will be no problem.
I will forgive your harsh remarks
just for today.
Who asked for your forgiveness?
It will be no problem.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But I have no other choice.
Grandpa, you're the mayor
of this village.
Whether anyone lives or not,
how could you make everyone a commie?
You're right.
I did it because I'm the mayor.
If I could protect this village
by being the only coward,
I'd use my tongue to lick
the rear of any commie.
Grandpa.
When everyone fought
for independence from Japan,
your father was the first one
to be killed.
But I can't let them
take you away.
- I can't. I can't.
- Grandpa.
It will end soon.
Park Seung-tae
How have you been?
My father told me to greet you
when I come to the South.
1940, Laoning, China
Independence rebels transfer of funds
Let's go.
Park Seung-tae!
You came far.
Disguising as a wedding march
was less conspicuous.
Jung-woong, you've grown a lot.
The gift.
This is a new version.
"White Stone"
From Park Seung-tae to Jung-woong
Funds collected from 200,000
Independence fighters.
Memories of Maggie
A western poet named
George Johnson wrote it.
There's a song, too.
Do you want to hear it?
I wandered today to the hill...
To the hill, Maggie...
Do you like this game?
I used to like it at your age.
I don't like it.
I'm too old for it.
Father!
Father...
We will meet again.
Dangjin Energy Reactor
North Korea Infantry Post
Dangjin Energy Reactor
North Korea Infantry Post
How long did you walk?
Your feet are totally torn.
How long did you walk?
Your feet are totally torn.
You're an official.
Stop overreacting.
Stay still.
Be gentle.
I'm sorry.
I should've gone to the southern
front line instead of you.
What are you talking about?
Thanks to you, I was able to visit
my mother's grave in 20 years.
By the way, did you meet her?
You know, the girl who you
wanted to meet in the South.
Oh yeah, right...
Wow, so did she welcome our
liberation knight with open arms?
Well, things were quite
different than expected.
The days of persecution
are finally over.
I, Kim Jung-woong, will protect you
with these very hands.
You're so wonderful!
Kim Jung-woong!
Kim Jung-woong!
Sul-hee!
How have you been?
You came back in such
a great and manly form.
Thank you!
Maybe since ten years have passed,
she couldn't recognize me at all.
Only if the Sergeant hadn't caused
a ruckus in the beginning.
I shouldn't tell her, right?
I heard he threw the mayor down.
Yeah, he did.
How about waiting until you two
get to know each other again?
The time will come.
Yeah...
Or it couldn't.
Oh boy...
Eat plenty.
It will be a matter of time
until we conquer all of the South.
Get it right.
It's not conquering, it's liberating.
What are you looking at?
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at the food!
Thank you very much.
The meat has been cooked
very well.
What are you doing?
Didn't you hear what they said
about equal distribution?
But he's the Lieutenant.
Differentiating ranks
is a form of class.
These people hate that.
Right?
Eat!
Eat it before anyone sees.
How can I eat this?
My son has been taken away.
So you think I can digest this?
I'm sorry about
what happened to Suk-ho.
Where did you get this from?
It's not so bad cooking
for the commies.
And have some of this.
It's moonshine.
Okay, I'll have some out of respect.
Give me a shot.
I'm sorry.
Have a shot, too.
Pardon?
Have a drink.
Okay.
Suk-ho liked meat so much.
Here you go.
That poor little boy.
He's probably too scared to sleep.
Dad...
Su-won!
Where is she?
Su-won!
Jae-choon, have you seen Su-won?
He's always sleeping.
What's wrong?
What is this?
So is this how you two made up?
Jae-choon.
Hey!
Wake up!
What is it?
What do you think?
Hey, wake up.
Oh my!
It's okay.
What are you doing?
It's okay.
Good...
Did you like it?
Go away.
Jae-choon, got anything to say?
Damn it.
Any sick person gets better
after Su-won's acupuncture.
So what happened?
She must've poisoned the liquor.
How great it is for two
lonely people to meet.
It's not what you think.
So aren't you going to be
responsible for her?
This is absurd.
Come on.
He must've gotten sick sleeping
on the floor after eating meat.
Is that so?
You must not give
your soldiers any blankets.
If everything is fine now...
Let's go.
Take it easy.
You need to save
your energy for the night.
Usually, a hero is born during a war.
But over here, we'll have a baby.
Stop aggravating me!
I was just happy to see you two
hug each other like that.
Stop talking nonsense
and keep stuffing that.
How absurd.
Anyway, will they like this?
We don't need the armbands now.
It depends on how loyal you are.
Before they ask something of us,
we need to find what we can do
for them first.
What do you know?
What are you doing?
It's a black scarecrow.
I finished making this.
What the hell is that?
I told you to make the eyes scary,
and not to put a smile on it!.
Just leave it there!
Okay.
How many times
do I need to tell her?
Why are you laughing?
It's nothing.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Go dig over there!
Music from the South
is quite enjoyable.
The air-raid shelter is quite big.
Intelligence says that many American
ships are docking at Pyungtaek Harbor.
An air raid is very possible
so we need to be prepared.
We caught this North Korean
soldier after he deserted us.
An army official at that.
But after we searched him,
he was carrying quite a load.
The foreign-educated Kim Jung-woong.
Now you look more like a soldier.
How is it being in charge
of the Pyongtaek region?
They've been cooperative so far.
Cooperative so far?
They could be on the outside.
Look straight!
A U.N. squadron is moving into the
area where the deserter was caught.
What?
Drag that traitor out of here!
That cowardly traitor...
Fire!
Fire!
For the Great Kim ll-sung!
(in a loud voice)
Worker's collective,
equal distribution
I wandered today to the hill, Maggie
Get it straight!
Do it right!
I want to hold the gun, too.
Son of a bitch!
He's just a kid!
You son of a bitch!
Get ready.
Applause!
For the visitors
who came for our village,
we prepared this after thinking long
and hard what we could do for you.
This is a much different model.
By making the head like this...
We made it for your training.
It'll be quite useful.
The face has expressions.
What happened to Jin-il?
What happened?
He got beaten.
Who do you think did it?
It's all because of that bastard.
Take this!
I was talking about how we
should make the nose this big.
We have an announcement tomorrow.
Tell everyone to gather.
Will do, sir!
Salute!
How are the children?
It was a training exercise.
The children shouldn't
be playing there.
Yes, the children should be
at school during that time.
Since the enemy took
the school away from us,
that shouldn't be a place
for the children to play.
Comrade Park Sul-hee,
we're not the enemy.
Anybody who raises their gun
on a child's parent is an enemy.
Are you playing dumb with me?
Were the ones who pointed their guns
at your father and mine our allies?
You suffered the same as me,
and know how cruel all this is.
But why?
You thought I'd welcome you
like some knight in shining armor?
You were an innocent young man
who liked poems.
Not someone who'd threaten
people with guns.
You think I wouldn't know
the pain we've suffered?
I wanted to do what I could
to make a better world...
I don't get it.
Whether it was the Japanese,
Americans, or now,
the ones who got hurt
in the end were us.
Why is that?
An air-raid shelter?
That's right.
We need to be prepared for
any air-raid that would come.
- Yes.
- He's right.
Is there an adequate place?
We will dig the shelter.
- What?
- What?
Your village has gotten everything.
Since you have the women's group,
we'll create a men's group
and take care of it in a jiffy.
That's absurd.
A bomb will kill instantly.
Where the bomb will hit
is unpredictable.
So if the shelter is in Sodommul,
our villagers will die on the way.
We have a lot of people!
- That's right!
- Yeah!
Then you'll live only.
Of course we have to live!
The location...
Quiet!
I will determine the location
after I make an inspection.
How far is it?
We're almost there.
There it is.
Over there?
The ground is exceptional there.
Our land expert thinks highly of it.
There hasn't been a piece of land
that I haven't inspected.
All the mountains and water
surrounding this village
is like creating a dragon's nest.
If you look carefully at the soil,
it's like the food that breeds it.
- Dragon's food?
- You got to be kidding me.
You'll be cured of diseases and can
dodge bullets if you carry it around.
Oh yeah? Then why did his father's
grave turn out so horrible?
I heard you struck a water vein.
Yeah, it was a hot spring!
You don't need to listen to them.
There's no land like it in Korea.
If you plant a dead tree there,
a flower will bloom the next day.
This isn't just dirt.
- What are you doing?
- It's medicine!
Don't eat the rocks.
Why don't you just swallow it?
While we're on the subject,
kill him and bury him there.
If he survives tomorrow,
then we'll be on our way.
That sounds perfect.
I got a tool for it right here.
Good thing you brought that.
What's wrong with you all?
It's because of him.
I will make my decision
with careful examination.
Next is Sukjunglee.
Sukjunglee Air-raid
Shelter Exhibition
First, I'd like to define
what the air-raid shelter is.
What is an air-raid shelter?
An air-raid shelter is made
to avoid explosions.
Sodommul aims to build a shelter on
an empty land without a single tree.
We are to face the explosion
and not avoid it.
This is a plane, right?
If I were the pilot,
I'd want to drop about two bombs
right about here.
To put it simply,
this is the land of hell!
The first condition is that it must
be concealing and inconspicuous.
Our suggestion is right over there.
It's dark and misty so you can't tell
whether it's day or night.
About 84 percent of our children
were made there.
That's right.
We did it there, too.
The second condition...
Grandpa, don't just lie there.
Say something.
Lieutenant?
He has something to say.
Elder comrade.
Come to your senses.
Elder comrade.
Air...
Air...
Air-raid shelter...
Elder comrade.
- Elder comrade.
- Grandpa...
Oh no, poor Grandpa!
Grandpa, I will take things over
and create a great shelter.
I will dig it perfectly.
The time for a great improvement
of Sodommul has come!
Start the dig!
You said that you were going to win.
I knew something
was up his sleeve.
Dig deep, Jae-choon.
Comrade Jae-choon,
eat this and cheer up.
What are you doing?
It looked too empty here.
Go down.
Just leave it.
It wasn't me. It was the cow.
When is dad coming back?
I want to ride on his shoulders.
This is killing me.
Giddyup! Giddyup!
Stop overreacting, Lieutenant.
It wasn't me.
It was him.
You're going to do
the rest of the field, right?
Since you took everyone away,
we're short of hands for farming.
How can l?
The sun will set soon.
Hurry and eat.
Lieutenant!
Big trouble!
How could there be water?
Nice and clean.
I told you so!
It's a hot spring!
Everywhere I dug, it was all water.
I thought we came here to dig a well.
That's an air-raid shelter?
Look! A rainbow!
The air-raid shelter
will be dug in Sukjunglee.
Also, all the comrade men who are
volunteer soldiers will instead
dig the air-raid shelter.
Great news! Hurray!
Hurray!
Finally, in order to watch over any
anti-communist movements
our camp will be moved
to the Mayor's home.
Comrade Park Sul-hee, teach
the children again at the church.
But they must not go to the training
ground nor the air-raid shelter.
Is that understood?
Yes, Lieutenant.
That is all.
But, Lieutenant!
Lieutenant, please have a drink.
No thank you.
We don't drink.
- But this booze is good.
- I'm okay.
