oh, bravo.
Wow, dave,
so enlightened.
I mean,
you didn't even notice.
Whoo. Get a new dream,
martin luther king.
This one just came true.
- So ellie--
she's the one who's squeamish
About the texture of coconuts.
- That detail doesn't matter.
Will you just get to the end?
- Or was it her sister?
No, no, no, babe.
Her sister is the one
who has the triplets.
- What is pertinent?
Like, I can't follow the thread.
- She got pulled over.
- Who did?
- Mandy.
- Who is mandy, okay?
I mean, I don't even--
now there's a mandy?
- There's always been a mandy.

At least we're trying.

<i>Men in.Ugh.
What is that word?</i>
It has that actor will smith,

- Okay, you know what?
Excuse me for being sensitive.
- No, dave, I am in awe.
I mean, where does it stop?
Do you see gender?
Do you even know

Or do you just see

State-of-the-art kitchen.
It's, um--it's your basic
dream house.
- It's a bit
out of our price range.
- When you entered
this beautiful home,
Was it in your price range?
Did you have some sort
of great business reversal
In the 20 minutes we spent
showing you this place?
Why did you waste our time?
- I was gonna go with "maybe
we show you the smaller house
We have on hillcrest."
But humiliating him
in front of the missus--
That's a way to go too.
- It's just a great house.
It deserves a great owner,
like me or you.
We should've been rich.
Why didn't we start
a hedge fund?
- We don't really know
what they are.
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, 5:00--
open house officially closed.
- You know what we should do?
We should hang here
and watch the hockey game.
- Here? No.
Owners are out of town--
Highly inappropriate.
- It is always something
with you.
What happened to us?
We never do anything anymore.
- We went to lunch yesterday.
- Lunch?
When is the last time you and I
had a classic dave/vance hang,
No work, no ladies?
- Classic. Now, that--
yeah, it has been some time.
- We're taking this...
For granted.
- Let's go. Let's go watch
the game at a bar.
- It's too late for that.
My passion for this idea
has taken root.
Where's the tv?
- No. That's a bad--
Are you--
that's really unethical.
People trust us with their home.
- This is happening.
- Once you cross that line,
there's no going back.

relationship is...
- Better than the ones
they have with us? Yeah.

a bullet with rex--
No intense best buddy.

some candidates.
Over time, they kind of fell
by the wayside.
Hi. Rex is dead.
Okay.

- Sweetie, we were just
talking about you.

We should carbo-load.

- Hey, sleepyhead,
we lost you last night.
You crash in the game room?
- Uh, uh, no.
I-I just went home.
- You did? Why?
- Oh, I wanted
a good night's sleep,
Which was great, by the way,
Because this morning,
bright and early,
I got a phone call
from the fosters,
Who want to see
the house.
Mr. And mrs. Foster,
welcome.
Thanks for coming.
Feel free to take a look around.
They're very interested.
- Nice shoes.
- Is this because amy
came over?
- I figure we've had our fun,
and let's just get back to work.
- So you get to decide
when the fun is over?
Have you heard the news,
mr. And mrs. Foster?
Dave is my new dad.
Hi, I'm vance.
You're gonna love this house.
It's beautiful.
There's a ton of history.
I'm sure you've heard about that
murder that took place here.
- [laughs]
he's kidding.
Uh, it's just
a whole thing we do.
Um, so you can see the pool
from here.
It's very nice.
- That's where he did it.
Right there,
under the water.
- It's got five bedrooms.
- Five dead rooms.
- May I speak
with you outside?
- Not before I speak
with you outside.
[both laugh]
- Whoo!
That's 5-0, losers.
- One more game,
and we win that trophy.
- Yes!
- Your forehand's looking great.
- Oh, man, you look strong.
Whoo!

The only thing
that would've made it better
Is if you were out there

- Okay.
- What?
- Well, my elbow's all better,
and I can play now.
Is that okay
with you, julia?
- What?
- Can I borrow your paddle?
- It's a racket.
- Babe, let's go!
- Admit it. You're ticked off
because amy's here.
- You know what?
I'm going back in to my clients.
- Not until you admit it.
- Okay, you should get
out of my face.
- You shouldn't

Hey. Let me show you guys
the kitchen.
- No, I'm not mad.
It's just tennis.
- Really?
'cause you seem mad.
- How could I be?
You tried your best.
- Rex, you were one game away
from winning.
And then I start to play,
and then we lose 13 in a row.
- Second place isn't bad,
you know?
- Rex, if you love me,
You'll be honest with me
right now.
- I got beat
by old people.
I was trash-talked
by an orthodontist.
He called himself
the rex-ecutioner.
He asked me what I wanted
for my last meal.
I'm a big man, leigh.
I need a big trophy.
I hate this thing.
Where are we gonna put it?
- I'm so sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.
- I forgive you.
I'm over it.
- Well, I'm still pretty
frustrated.
- Don't pile on, julia.
- I wish I were an athlete...
But I'm not.
- Leigh, we have so much.
If we had any more,
We'd be that couple
that everyone hates.
We'd be, like, gandhi
and mother teresa.
- Not sure
they ever consummated that one.
- Sports is just such a big part
of who you are.
It must be fun
to share that with him.
- Leigh, how about I just
give you some lessons?
- Really?
That's amazing.
- Yeah, I think it could be fun.
It would be my pleasure.
- Great.
Now, you should know
I have terrible
hand-eye coordination
And a bit of an attitude.
- And she's got a mouth
on her.

out of that pretty, little face.
- Rockets will be thrown.
Mother[bleep].
- Getting better.
- Piece of [bleep].
- Nice contact.
- Oh, [bleep].
- Let's take a break!
- I can't believe
he hasn't called to apologize.
- I can.
Whenever you two fight,
It always plays out
exactly the same way.
- Don't know my patterns.
- You brood. You mope.
You complain to me.
And then one of you comes up
with some lame excuse
To get back together.
- Dave, you know
how I'm allergic to nuts?
Well, I just ate a bunch
by mistake.
- Yes, is the number you call
for the exact time, please?
Oh, vance. I must--oh. Oh.
- I'm on my way.
- So what's it gonna be, huh?
Am I gonna have to sit through
another two-week spiral
With all of the emotional eating
that comes with that,
Or are you just gonna talk
to him now?
- I'll talk to him.
- And, honey--
did you bring that with you?
Where did you get that?
Honey!
- Hey, guys.
Vance, you won. Dave caved.
- Oh, I graciously accept.
But as the receiver
of the apology,
I do have some conditions.
- Why would you accept?
I don't need to apologize
to you.
- Dave.
- Thanks to your wife,
This whup-ass will remain
in its can.
- Here's the thing.
You insisted we have our night,
and you bring amy into it.
And I-it was thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? Thoughtless?
You're--you're calling me
thoughtless?
- Say "thoughtless" again.
That's good.
- All right.
For years,
I haven't said anything
'cause it's too painful,
But the way you ditched me
when you and julia got serious,
That was thoughtless.
- What? Are--you--
with julia?
I handled things great.
- Oh, really? What about the day
you moved out on me?
- What about it?
- You left me
while I was at the dmv.
There's no last moment
together, man.
There's no, you know,
"hey, it's been
a good six years, buddy."
No "you know what?
I'm really proud of you
For getting that class-m
motorcycle license."
It's just
that horrible voice mail.
- I'm--I'm sure
it wasn't horrible.
- Well, why don't we just
take a listen?
- Wh--how--what,
did you save a message
From three years ago?
[on phone]
hey, vance, it's dave.
Both: Just wanted to call
and say hey.
I left the extra keys
on the kitchen counter.
- [vance, amy with voice mail]
also, let me know
When the electric bill comes.
We'll figure out how to prorate
the days I wasn't there.
Er, um, let's see.
What else?
[clicking tongues]
that's it.
All right.
Check you on the flip side.
- Yeah. That--that's not
a good message.
- No.
- I feel like I left a note.
- I feel like it was
about the leftover food
And what to do with it.
Then you promised to...
Both: Check me
on the flip side.
- You did
kind of say that a lot.
- I'm sorry, man,
really, sincerely.
That was--
I handled things badly.
And, um, you didn't say anything
this whole time.
That takes a big man--
Somewhat undercut
by the message saving, but...
And that's not
the original phone,
Which implies some sort
of downloading
Onto a hard drive.
- We grow up, man, you know?
And you meet a great lady.
And, you know, this just--
this gets harder.
- I know, man.
Hey.
I know. Yeah.
I think--yeah.
Hmm.
But you know what?
In some ways,
I think the girls actually
bring us closer together.
If it wasn't for julia,
I probably
wouldn't have come tonight.
- If I have to share you
with anybody, I'm glad it's her.
She's a peach.
- And you're a peach too.
- Aw. Can I have
my own word, though,
Like cookie or princess or...
Big mama?
- Hey, sullivans don't get home
till tomorrow.
Let's make a pledge.
If we get rich,
the four of us buy a house
Like this together.
- Dibs on master bedroom!
- Damn it.
- That's not
gonna happen, right?
- Hmm. Don't worry.
There is no way those two
are ever getting rich.
