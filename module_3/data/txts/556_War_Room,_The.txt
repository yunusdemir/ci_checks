We've had some problem with Kerrey people
ripping down our signs...
but we're gonna take care of that.
- [Onlookers Laughing]
- Um, other than —
- [Man] They're gonna ask them not to.
- Yeah.
We also have a schizophrenic newspaper
which, like...
prints every shit possible on the front page
and then apologizes in the editorial.
It's really bizarre.
The Tsongas sign on Route 3
lasted all of two days.
- It's gone now.
- [Laughter]
[Man] Those Harkin people
are stealin' everyone's signs. It's amazing.
Short of, uh, calling for negative ads —
although maybe —
is there any effort underfoot
to go after Tsongas?
Let's face it.
This guy cannot be squeaky clean.
[Man] Sure. Well, this is the question about that,
and let's throw that out here.
The problem with attacking Senator Tsongas is —
I mean, we jokingly call him St. Paul.
It could really backfire against us
to someone else's advantage.
- Absolutely.
- Um, and that's been —
That's what —
[Clears Throat]
[Man] And it'll look bad,
because he's complimented him all along.
And then to come the last week and say
that he's bad — I think it will look bad.
We have to do a better job
of saying our differences.
We always seem to be defending.
We don't have to defend a damn thing.
We got the best — We know he's
the best candidate, 'cause we've met him.
And if everybody in the state
of New Hampshire met him...
we wouldn't have a problem —
we know that.
Thank you.
I'm glad to be with you.
I wasn't in the leather jacket group,
but, uh...
you know, I had a good time.
But I was a pretty straight kid.
I worked hard enough
to make good grades...
but I basically liked my music
and my friends...
and I had a heck of a good time
when I was in high school.
We had a band in high school called
The Three Kings. I've still got a record.
You bet.
Thank you.

[Man Chuckling] He likes me.
He may not like Clinton, but he likes me.
I'll bet you I said something
you could take out of context.
- You weird guys gotta stick together.
- Mm-hmm. [Laughing]
"Clinton and Brown have little in common
except off-the-wall campaign gurus."
[All Laughing]
"Clinton's is James Carville,
a Cajun who wears jeans with bright shirts.
Brown's is a Frenchman
named Jacques Barzhagi...
who wears jeans with a black leather jacket
and black beret, indoors and out.
Carville says of Brown,
'He's just not us.'
Barzhagi says cryptically,
'Let them spin. We will win."'
[All Laughing]
You know my mother and them hates that.
They say, "Why do they portray you like that?
We were nice people.
We sent our children to college.
You go up there and you act like
some kind of weirdo." [Laughing]
I said, "Ma, they're not interested in the fact
that you sent me to college."

[Man]
Gennifer.
[Man #2]
Sit down.
Good afternoon.
This whole experience
is not easy for me.
Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover
for 12 years...
and for the past two years I have lied to the press
about our relationship to protect him.
The truth is, I loved him.
Now he tells me to deny it.
Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit...
and I'm sick of all of the lies.
- [Camera Shutters Clicking]
- [Reporters Chattering]
It's that way.
[Female Reporter] Mr. Clinton, what's
your relationship with Gennifer Flowers?
There really isn't one, obviously.
[Chuckles]
I mean, the charges are false.
The, uh — Today she took money
to publish a story...
that she hired a lawyer to say
was absolutely defamatory over a year ago.
And, uh, it's sad.
It's sad that this sort of thing
could be published...
in a newspaper like the Star
which says Martians walk on the earth.
You'd never ask me
if Martians walk on the earth.
[Male Reporter]
Will you comment on the tapes she has?
No. I can't. I haven't heard 'em.
[Flowers On Tape]
The reason I was calling was to tell you...
that this last Wednesday,
someone got into my apartment.
- [Man On Tape] Hold on a minute.
- [Flowers] Okay.
- [Man] So somebody broke in your apartment?
- [Flowers] Well, yeah.
There wasn't any sign of a break-in,
but the drawers and things —
There wasn't anything missing
that I could tell, but somebody had —
[Man] Somebody had
gone through all your stuff.
[Flowers]
Had gone through my stuff.
[Man] You think they were -
But they didn't steal anything?
[Flowers] No. No. My jewelry -
I mean, I had jewelry here. It was still here.
[Man] You think they were
tryin' to look for somethin' on us?
[Flowers]
I think so. I mean, why else? Uh —
[Man] You weren't missin' any —
any kind of papers or anything?
[Flowers]
Like what kind of papers?
[Man] Well, I mean,
any kind of personal records...
or checkbooks or anything like that —
phone records?
- [Flowers] Do I have any?
- [Man] Yeah.
- [Flowers] Uh-uh. I mean, why would I?
- [Man] I don't know. I just —
[Flowers] You usually call me, for that matter.
And besides, who would know?
[Man] Uh, but I just think that
if everybody's on record denying it...
you got no problem.
Hold on just a sec here, people.
- Where'd he go?
- [Reporters Clamoring]
[Female Reporter]
Do you have any comments...
about the allegations from Gennifer Flowers
and the tape recordings?
She was worried about being assumed to be
guilty just because her name was brought in.
I said, "That's not true.
Even if your name gets used, in the absence
of proof, nobody can prove you're guilty.
Don't worry about it. Tell the truth. Just tell 'em
that you didn't do it." That's all I ever said.
- [Male Reporter] How do you know her?
- See ya.
[Male Reporter]
Thank you, Governor.
[Male Reporter] Did the governor
at any time tell you on the telephone...
to just tell the truth
about what happened?
He told me to just deny it.
[Male Reporter]
Did Governor Clinton use a condom?
- [Reporters Snickering, Laughing]
- Jesus. Right here.
Right here.
Ladies and gentlemen — Ladies and gentlemen,
we're gonna put this to a stop...
if there are any further questions
that are degrading, in my opinion, like that.
Now, right here, sir.
[Male Reporter]
You were paid by the Star.
Did anyone ever approach you
from the Republican Party —
perhaps another Democratic candidate —
to urge you to tell this story publicly?
- Yes, they did.
- Who?
- I can't say.
- Wait. You're saying —
Wait, are you saying
that somebody from another campaign —
Democratic Party or Republican Party —
approached you to tell this story?
Was it the Democratic Party
or was it the Republican Party, Ms. Flowers?
It was the Republican Party.
We knew we'd get attacks,
but, I mean, you know —
We just couldn't believe the press would
pick up a tabloid story that somebody —
I mean, we're at a new low in a way.
That's why it's so important.
But we are fighting back.
Somebody who's been through
a lot of tough elections...
is James Carville, who's known
as the Ragin' Cajun in the business.
- [Scattered Applause]
- We'd like him to say a couple of words to you.
[Carville] Uh, we have a tough fight
comin' right down the stretch.
It's gonna come out that Roger Ailes is behind
a lot of this stuff before the election...
that you been seein'
about Governor Clinton.
- Okay? Ailes.
- [Man] Boo!
And of course Bush
and Georgette Mosbacher and everything.
Let me tell you
what's at stake in this election.
Every time that somebody comes along
that's got some ideas —
a Democrat comes along —
the Republicans come up here
and they ambush him.
Remember Muskie?
Okay?
That is standard procedure.
And here comes Clinton.
He comes to New Hampshire.
People here are hurtin'.
They want hope. They want somebody
with vision. He gives it to 'em.
So what do Republicans do?
They get together with their wedge issues
and they knock it off.
If they succeed this time,
it's gonna be every time.
You are never going to get
a presidential candidate. Okay?
You're never gonna get somebody
to come up here and run for president...
that's served 11 years as governor
who's got any kind of experience.
Okay? And every time somebody
comes up, they're gonna do it.
If we win this, then you have
knocked this shit back forever.
- [Applause]
- Okay?
And every time that we get a Democrat
that we can believe in...
Roger Ailes
a-a-and Georgette Mosbacher —
You know that she's the secretary
of the person closest to Bush.
You know what she said?
She can't wait till this election's over so
she can get her Maserati and her jewels back.
That's the mind-set you're fightin' against.
And if they beat us back —
Paul Tsongas —
Look, he ain't gonna win anything, okay?
This is not about Paul Tsongas.
It's about George Bush and Roger Ailes
and Georgette Mosbacher...
and the whole sleazy little cabal of 'em
that wanna keep hold of anything...
and that wanna knock anybody off
that we believe in...
and anything that we care about.
And if we beat them
and you're out there...
and your knuckles get tired
or your feet get cold or anything else...
you think about that.
Because if they knock us off,
then so what?
The next one that comes up,
they gonna knock the next one off.
- [Applause, Cheering]
- And the next one and everything else.
And you know what kind of shit
you're gonna get?
You're gonna get the kind
of Supreme Court that you got.
You're gonna get the kind of four different
positions on civil rights that you get from 'em.
You gonna get tax breaks for the wealthy.
You gonna get a guy that doesn't know
what a grocery store scanner is. Okay?
So let's go. We got —
You know, we got six more days to go.
And don't forget
who the real enemy is in here.
And don't forget what we're really
campaigning against. Thank y'all very much.
[Applause, Cheering]
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
- Hello.
- [Girl] This is Ally.
Is that Ally? Oh, I'm so —
And what's your bear's name?
- [Girl] Kelly.
- Okay, good.
[Man] Four more years!
Four more years! Four more years!
[Bush] How are you? Good.
Nice to see you. Good to see you. Thank you.
[Female Announcer] Some say his campaign
appears to slip further every day.
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton
remains tight-lipped...
about a controversial letter
regarding the Vietnam draft.
Ask the president
when he gets off the plane...
to call the Pentagon
and ask how the letter got out.
W-W-Wait a minute.
What do we got here?
What is the Pentagon doing
in the middle of a political campaign?
And what is the Pentagon doing
leaking something...
that we asked for November 6
that they didn't give us?
Now, Governor Clinton has a character problem,
but I take it that your line of...
Governor Clinton has no character problem.
He's passed his character test.
Well, I mean, he has not denied
that he has engaged in marital infidelity.
He denied a specific one.
- He has said that
he had problems in his marriage.
- That's right.
And he has talked about the draft.
And to some people, it's a character problem.
Bill Clinton's passed his character test
throughout his life and throughout this campaign.
And he's shown it through
his commitments to real fights.
What he's gonna do in this campaign is focus
on what's important to the American people —
on jobs and education.
That's what the American people care about.
They wanna move into the future.
They don't want to be
diverted by side issues...
and they're not gonna let
the Republican attack machine divert them.
- [Applause]
- I'm getting sick and tired —
I am — every single night...
hearing one of these carping
little liberal Democrats...
jumping all over my you-know-what.
- And I can't wait for this campaign.
- [Applause, Cheering]
The friction in this is gonna be
too much for Clinton to survive.
I think it's only really a matter of days before
he'll have to get out... if not hours.
- Tell me your name.
- John Bickerstaff.
- John, Hillary Clinton.
- I'm the night baker.
I think if we could just keep one-on-one
and one-on-one, energy, energy, energy...
- I think we can make it.
- You bet.
- [Woman] I bet they miss Arkansas.
- They do.
Well, it's a lot like home.
Don't you think it is?
- [Woman] I mean, it's what he's gonna do.
- That's exactly right.
That's the bottom line right there.
I don't wanna hear any more
of this "read my lips" business.
- Not charisma.
- Ride the wave right to the White House.
Leadership.
Proven ability to change.
We will have the most influential woman
on the presidents...
in the history of the United States
if I get elected.

Maybe they have an ad that's already in the can
about Clinton and his environmental record.
You're not worried about
his big, hardball, negative tactics...
that have worked for them
for 15 years?
- Um, it's all politics.
- Could start tomorrow.
- It's all politics.
- And you're convinced it won't work again?
I'm convinced that if they try it,
we'll hit 'em back and they'll buckle.
What are we gonna do
when George Bush attacks us?
I mean, there's the story
of AndrewJackson —
was in a duel with a guy,
and the guy shot and knocked him down.
The guy started walkin'. He says, "Hold to, sir.
Sit still there for a second. It's my turn."
Why can't we attack George Bush?
Why can't we talk about the lowest
economic growth in the last 50 years?
Why can't we talk about there being
a political hack as drug czar in this country?
Why can't we talk about the fact
that he has done nothin' about education...
the environment —
the deficit's outta control.
He said "no new taxes."
You can just go —
Why is it that I'm always asked...
"What are we gonna do
when George Bush attacks us?"
Why don't you go ask George Bush what's
he gonna do when we hold him accountable...
for all the wrong
that he's done to this country?
A-And you can segue,
you know, right into Bush.
The idea is, he reeks of yesterday.
He has the stench of yesterday.
He is so yesterday, if I think of yesterday —
if I think of an old calendar —
I think of George Bush's face on it.
Can you all have Marla come up to

Uh, it's gonna show extraordinary changes

Uh, it shows us with,

with a net positive favorable —
about 10 points more favorable —
Bush more negative —
net negative, by about 10...
and Perot even fave/un-fave
at around 37.
So that represents
a good six-point change or more.

Okay. Let's get started.
Shh, shh. Let's talk about the hall.
I think what we need
is some hand-done signs...
that show the kind of themes
that we want Clinton, you know —
Because hand-done signs
are the signs the network will cut to.
If anyone wants to make
their own signs, that's fine.
Scott, how many signs can we make
between now and tonight?
Can you make 2,000 signs that are —
I am not at all convinced that a bunch of
hodgepodge, handheld, homemade signs...
are gonna make the impact visually...
from both a television point of view
and from a podium point of view...
that a sea of the same kind of sign
across the hall.
May I just add that the problem
is that we have two kinds of signs.
We have thin, red signs —
white-on-red signs —
and then we have rectangular
white-on-blue signs.
We have a mixed message
out on the floor.
We went through this twice before
at two other conventions...
and that's basically the problem.
And also, Brown put out new signs
last night that were white on red...
in which the letters — the white letters —
were bigger than our letters.
And so they looked better.
How are we gonna foll —
The other thing —
Harold raised a very important issue
about delegates.
Whoa. Let's get one thing — Do we want
a bunch of handmade signs or not?
- I mean, that's... I don't think that's —
- [Man] I'm not talking about 2,000 —
No, wait a minute, Bob.
I was in the middle of a sentence, okay?
I'm not talking — You know, it's not the greatest
policy issue this group will ever decide...
but let's get a decision on it
so that at least the visibility people...
and John Hart's people
have some direction on it.
I don't particularly care.

Perot just pulled out. Out.
[Man #2]
Out. Perot's out.
Unbelievable.
The perception is
that Clinton has succeeded...
in pushing out one of his chief rivals
in the presidential race.
But on the other hand,
Clinton campaign advisers...
were counting on Perot to help them,
especially in the South.
Perot, with his harsh attacks
on President Bush...
worked to soften up the incumbent...
and that was perceived to be a help
to the Democratic candidate.
How's that?
Any kind of political earthquake like this
increases the intensity of coverage.
That means people are gonna see Bill Clinton
tonight step into the vacuum.
There's only two candidates
left in this race.
People are gonna tune in tonight
to hear what Bill Clinton has to say.
It's gonna be electric in there tonight.

[Bush]
My opponent won't remind you...
that interest rates
are the lowest they've been in 20 years...
and millions of Americans
have refinanced their homes.
[Cheering]
- [Delegates] George Bush! George Bush!
- My opponent says America is a nation in decline.
Of our economy, he says we are
somewhere on the list beneath Germany...
heading south towards Sri Lanka.
Well, don't let anyone tell you
that America is second-rate...
especially somebody
running for president.
[Delegates Cheering]
He's like that on a lot of issues.
First on one side, then the other.
He's been spotted in more places
than Elvis Presley.
[Delegates Cheering]
Liz?
I want to know if I can say this is
the first time an incumbent president...
has given an acceptance speech
and not mentioned his economic record.
Okay?
You can say that. Yeah.
That's a good James line.
B-But can Clinton —
Can he say that?
- [Woman] Isn't it cute?
- What about if he just said...
"Look, if I thought for one minute
he could do all that, I'd get out of the race."
Now, that —
There's somethin' there.
Say I'm gonna promise you
I'm gonna balance the budget.
Everybody in America's
gonna get a tax cut.
Thirty-seven million people that don't have
health insurance... We gonna cover all of you.
Anybody wants to go to any private school
they wanna go to, we gonna pay for it.
Except there are 41 million kids now
who go to school, and that's —
Shit, man. Don't —
Don't complicate the simple.
[Male Announcer] The convention poll
bounce a seven-point increase...
for the team of Bush and Quayle
since a similar poll taken just a week ago.
Last week, he gave an interview —
Governor Clinton did —
where he sounded as if he was getting ready
to measure the drapes in the Oval Office.
Well, I got news for ya: Not so fast.
I believe that come November 3,
my opponent and his saxophone...
will be playing that old Buck Owens classic,
"It's Crying Time."
[Onlookers Cheering]
- Hey.
- [Woman On Phone] Hey.
- It's a good spot. Suggestion.
- Okay.
At the end, you go...
"Fact: Arkansas is the second-lowest
tax-burdened state in the country."
You said, "This time we're not reading
your lips. We're reading your record."
[Woman] "This time don't read his lips.
Read the record." Yeah.
Whatever. But instead of that, go back one
more time and have him say, "Read my lips."
"No, sir.
This time we're reading the record."
[Woman] You can't. I'm just —
We have a time problem.
But that's just it. There's no less time to
go back to him and say, "Read my lips."
[Stephanopoulos]
"Read my lips. No. Read the record."
[Woman]
Um, he takes longer than anybody.
[Carville Groans]
Then cut somewhere else.
Let's get three times of,
"Read my lips."
[Stephanopoulos] Where else can we cut?
"Now he wants you," not "asking you."
"Government spending in Arkansas,
the lowest in the nation."
- [Woman] Which three facts?
- We're going with spending.
But in terms of scripts tonight,
we're gonna test alternatives —
- one with welfare and one with spending.
- [Woman] Okay.
[Man] I think for recording,
we should record the spending one.
Spending has priority.
If welfare's possible as a second shot —
Mandy, here's the way to save
maybe a half a second or a second.
- [Mandy] Yeah?
- Under the second announcer...
change the sentence to, "Now he wants you
to believe what he says about Bill Clinton."
[Mandy]
Actually, what I changed it to was...
"Now he's asking you to believe
his attacks against Bill Clinton."
- Fine. Either way. That's better.
- [Man] The other thing we could do, Mandy —
- [Mandy] Yeah.
- Maybe we could say —
Where we say, "No, Mr. President.
This time we're gonna read the facts"...
maybe could just say,
"No. This time we're gonna read the facts."
- [Stephanopoulos] Better.
- [Mandy] Yeah.
"No, sir."
Maybe that's a Southern thing,
but, "No, sir." "No — No, sir."
"No, sir."
But I just think it's very important
we get at the end, we get that "read my lips."
I know that that will drive them —
the voters —
It's the most famous broken promise
in the history of American politics.
[Mandy] I'm just telling you
that in the way it's set up to be factual...
and, you know, big facts —
What visual were you
thinking of with the fact?
[Mandy]
A big, you know, block of a fact sign.
Okay. Let's do that.
But let's just get this spot produced.
[Mandy]
Hey. I'm sitting in a studio. I'm doin' it.
- Talk to ya later.
- Bye!
I'll bet you one thing.
I just wanna say one thing. If this —
You need to call Mandy back and tell her
to be sure that she gets that "read —"
No. Not with me. To be sure she gets
"read my lips" in three times.
One day, in my time,
in my political career —
Every time that you suggest
something to a media person...
their first reaction is,
"We can't do that."
Every time.
"Well, we can't do that."
It doesn't take you long
to get to the second time though.
Yeah. I know. But just one time,
I would just like to say, "Let's do that."
Say, "Fine. That's easy, man.
What do you need? Here it is."
James, this idea was suggested a half hour ago.
Your script has been made in 20 minutes.
- She's in the studio producing it.
- The studio — producing it.
- That's 45 minutes.
- We've gone from a half hour...
to a concept to a spot.
- What the fuck do you want?
- Okay. I'm a hog. I'm a hog.
I suppose we could've gotten on the satellite
to get it out in 30 minutes!
You haven't even asked, but it'll probably
be at the focus group tonight at 6:00.
And, you know, most campaigns, it takes 'em
two days to get a spot out and run it. So okay.
You're right. You're right. Mandy's great.
Mandy's great. She's great.
- What was the last line?
- "Read my lips."
"No, sir. This time,
we're gonna read the record."
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh? Uh-uh?
- "This time we're gonna read the record."
- Uh-uh! U h-uh!
I like that. Who was the "uh-uh" man?
You were the "uh-uh" man?
- That little Greek is creative.
- You gonna call Mandy to give her the "uh-uh"?
I can't wait till you —

[Male Reporter]
Mary? Mary Matalin?
The demos in London —
You were talking about —
I am saying it is vintage Clinton...
that it is a pathological pattern
of deception.
He is an obsessive politician.
When he has been asked about
his antiwar activities in the past...
he has hedged, bobbed and weaved.
He has said to Frank White in his 1982 race,
"I don't know what he's talking about."
He has said in other races, "Oh, I just attended
a few marches to listen to the speeches."
He organized. He marched.
He wrote. He spoke.
According to Father McSorley,
he was a main antiwar organizer.
Why doesn't he just say that?
It's like the draft. Why didn't he just say
he was trying to avoid the draft?
No one is questioning that. They're questioning
why he always prevaricates on these issues.
If we cannot believe
anything he has said about his past...
how can we believe anything
he's saying about the future?
- [Female Reporter] Mary, I —
- I gotta get to my plane.
[Man] I have a question for Mr. Carville.
Did Bill Clinton go to Moscow?
- Are two pages missing from his passport?
- [Laughter]
Did he organize antiwar rallies
while he was in Moscow?
- Did he graduate from Oxford?
- [Guests Laughing]
Yes, he went to Moscow. He used to brag
about it in speeches when he ran for office.
He went to Warsaw too
and, I don't know, Oslo and wherever else.
And yet as a reporter from
one of the big papers called me —
"Did he have a transmitter
planted in his cavity while he was there?"
Wh-What diff— Why do you ask me
a question like that: "Did he go to Moscow?"
What difference does it make?
In 1970, Bill Clinton
went to Moscow.
Okay.
An answer!
[Carville] But — What? It does. I mean,
he's answered it a thousand times.
He's said that he went.
What — It's irrelevant to the question.
And that's my point.
- What did he do there?
- How the hell do I know what he did in Moscow?
I mean, I don't know what he did.
Maybe — I don't — You know —
[Stammering, Chuckling]
At that time
in our nation's history, though —

Some could have been heavily criticized
for going to a country...
that was supplying the enemies
of the U nited States.
They were doing student exchanges.
We were playin' 'em in basketball, man.
What are you talkin' about?
I mean, come on.
I mean, we had track meets
with these people.
The issue here isn't patriotism.
You can demonstrate

How would you like a videotape
of a newscast on Brazilian television...
that has —
We believe the script
goes something like this...
with appropriate visuals
of printing presses.
"The Republican campaign..."
Is what?
What it is is that Bush is buyin'
up to $10 million in printing in Brazil...
and the Brazilian TV ran it.
It's these huge printing presses
with Bush-Quayle material coming —
I mean, it's perfect for the news —
for television.
Lathered, man. They just can't wait

All right. All I'm saying is,
it's possible. Possible.
[Greenberg] But they have pictures
of the convention in them.
- Right.
- They just used — They used it.
What is it, poss —
What are you trying —
It's possible that they were printed
in primary money.
- Well, that still —
- So what?

It's a big — You're talking taxpayer funds,
and that's what you said —
- No. That ain't —

I don't think it's gonna —

what we're dealing with.

who got the contract...
and how they did that,
what guys have lobbying things in Brazil —
Yeah. There's no sense in this thing
being a one-day story.
I don't believe. I think we gotta kinda
ooze this thing out a bit.
I'll call and find out... call the source.
It's very sweet.
See about getting an uplink
out of São Paulo.
See how hard it is, how many times
you gotta hop it to get it up here.

if they've sent any checks
to this Brazilian company?
- Yeah.
- That —
Okay, this was a — This was aired
during the Republican convention —
- So that's pri —
- which means that it was primary money.
- Still government money.
- It's still...
I have a feeling it's R.N.C.,
is what I've thought all along.
- No, it can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.
- It can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.
It's illegal.
- Let's hope it's R.N.C.
- The issue's moot.
All we got to do is go out and get
the latest filing and see if there's a check.
I think we looked on it earlier.
We didn't find it.
We'll check now with updates.
It's possible it's a subcontract,
you know, that —
In fact, it is likely that they've done this
through their — maybe it was a media firm...
and it was subcontracted
through the media firm.
It's unlikely there's a direct check.
No, but somebody said,
if you look at the translation...
that they went to Ohio and Texas
and California.
- Right, but it could be —
- And where they came was Rio.
- All we can do is check —
- [Laughing]
- They came to Rio.
- We gotta respond —
What should be our response
to the Brazil thing?
[Greenberg] We're stunned.
We're speechless. We can't respond.

What's his 60-second spot? What does

What is it?
What do people think about Bush?
He cares more about foreign things,

- Foreign.
- Yeah.
There's something —
We knew he spent a lot of time overseas.
Now he's spending a lot of taxpayer money
over there, or something.
Foreign aid is something —
something like that.

No, here it is.

that were printed in Brazil, okay?
What do they say happened
to the materials?
Yeah, but if they can't produce

there are on the draft...
and how many stories there are on
George Bush's election year promises.
Okay?
Oh... Oh, oh, oh, oh!
A lot more. A lot more.
Okay. I'm gonna go back and see.
You know, George Bush
mentioned the draft one time.
He mentioned it one time...
and let's see how many stories
that was written on the draft.
Oh, okay. Well, you said if you wanna
say something, then say something.
I'm giving you an example
of there's a lot more fascination...
with the quote, "draft issue," unquote,
or Gennifer Flowers...
than there is with George Bush
promising $16 zillion more...
than he could ever spend
in an election year.
I believe that on any number of things...
that we are held to a different standard.
I think it is absolutely ludicrous...
that no one ever asked George Bush
about Iran-Contra.
Two cabinet secretaries
saying Bush was lying.
No one ever said a damn thing.
You get this memo from Baker...
about him knowing about —
about Iraq having chemical weapons going.
And then there's no follow-up because,
God, you can't askJim Baker a question.
This man is down deep —
He's beyond being questioned.
He gives everybody tickets to the opera.
We can't question him.
You know?
This is not directed any more
at the Washington Post.
I've had this conversation
with everybody today.
You know, I am so goddamn tired...
of this goddamn double standard...
where the press lets these sons of bitches
get away with murder...
and every little thing that we do —
"Clinton's numbers don't add up!
Clinton's numbers don't add up!"
- That is so fucking true.
- You know?
It's so unbelievable.
If we say 50 plus 50 is 104,
and they say 50 plus 50 is 104,000...
they'll say, "Well, both of them are stretching
their numbers a little bit."
- Hello? Yeah.
- [Laughs] Exactly.
Oh, the goddamn stories.
They're not going with the story.
The printing... The —
Printing the, uh —
Shit, you know.
[Carville] I think that they've given up
on it now, Governor.
The Bush people said they got the guy wired,
said, "Well, I just did it.
It was an offshore operation," you know?
So they're trying to nail him. So it's not
dead, but it's just not going tonight.

and he just spent the money himself...
and they never authorized it.
Okay. Give me a call later, okay?

meet with the commission.
It's another date certain.
Another debate that goes by.
Let's just get it out right away. If you can
get it out tonight, it would be the best.
'Cause it'll be in the papers
in the morning.
Yeah. I mean, so —
[Stammers]
Yeah, so tell them —
- Yeah, hold on. What?
- I want to talk to Clinton about it too...
but Today show is willing to give us
10 minutes tomorrow just to... pop.
Here. Hold on. Just talk to Paul.
Here's Georgie.
- Just tell him what to —
- Hey. I just talked to the Today show.
We ought to be on this thing
like stink on shit, man.

♪ Yours is a very important voice
and it should be heard ♪
Come on, America!
Vote, vote, vote!
- [Laughs] Thanks. Thanks.
- [Man] Give 'em hell, Bill!
[Man #2]
Governor.
Bill Clinton, number two on your ballot,
number one in your heart. [Laughs]
I just — I just can't imagine why
they agreed to positioning...
that puts him at such a severe angle.
Nice tie. I can tell you're not a politician.
[Exhaling]
Well, thank you. My mother bought it.
I don't know the right lines.
- Part of my clothing allowance.
- How Midwest. That's great.
It's just a joke.
It's just a joke.
No. I like it.
I like that your mother bought it.
- My mother didn't buy it. My mother —
- Family values.
My mother should get such deals.
- Family...
- Should we get set up?
Well, we're stepping in
as soon as they are done.
- Good.
- Yeah.
[Chattering Continues]
What is this? Is this an interview
with the Secret Service guys?
All right.
Oh, now, don't embarrass me
on the air.
[Laughs]
He's lookin' good, Mom.
Lookin' good.
Well, you're going to hear
an awful lot of spinning.
One of those who will be doing some
serious spinning from the right...
is Mary Matalin...
the deputy campaign manager
for the Bush/Quayle campaign.
Ms. Matalin, let's talk about
first the polls.
They are behind in the polls.
There's no way to deny that.
What is George Bush
going to say tonight...
that hopefully, in his case,
will turn things around?
[Laughs]
Well, I think Mary Matalin's got a good career
in fiction writing when this is over.
[Laughing]
[Man lmitating Al Gore]
Everything that's up is down.
[Laughing]
Paul, could you come to Atlanta
and help me prepare for the debate?
[Man #2]
Wow. What a crowd.
I have never even heard
Stockdale open his mouth.
What a crowd.
The thought of preparing
for someone who...
I don't even know what he speaks like
is daunting, to say the least.
- Paul, give 'em —
- Give 'em a Perot.
- Give 'em a Perot. Come on, man.
- [Imitating Ross Perot] Well, okay.
It's very interesting, James. I find it's
fascinating that y'all in national media —
Okay, y'all — you never want
to talk about the deficit.
It's a crazy aunt in the basement.
We're gonna go down that basement...
clean her out, sweep her out
and whack her around a little bit...
knock the bitch around.
The problem is,
when you get under that hood...
some son of a bitch in Washington
slams that hood right down on you.
Hurts like hell.
- ♪ Whatcha got cookin'? ♪
- [Laughing]
♪ How about cookin'
somethin' up with me? ♪
These have turned into real shows,
you know that?
Gettin' better.
The first thing is that
since there are four debates...
the first one is incredibly important.
And we want to establish ourselves
as the folks that the press can trust...
or they'll either go to their own
research departments...
which are pretty incompetent,
or they'll come to the campaign.
So the less political sounding
our responses are, the better.
George and James and Bruce will have to be
in there spinning immediately afterwards.
Right.
So as we always say, you know, speed kills...
and we will die in this debate if we're not
there first with our answers.
- Where's Clinton going?
- [Moderator]
Governor Clinton, one minute, sir.
[Clinton] The mistake that was made
was making the "read my lips" promise...
in the first place just to get elected...
- knowing what the size of the deficit was.
- [Applause]
[Stephanopoulos]
Yes!
[Carville]
Perfect. Perfect.
You just can't promise something
like that just to get elected...
if you know there's a good chance that
circumstances may overtake you.
[Moderator] All right.
Mr. Perot, the question is for you.
Perfect. Oh, yes. I love this.
In terms of being influenced
by women and being a minority...
there they are right out there —
my wife and my four beautiful daughters.
- And I just have one son —
- [Carville] He lost — Uh-oh.
- So he and I are surrounded by women —
- Oh, wow.
Giving us —
telling us what to do all the time.
- [Man] What?
- [All Groaning]
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I want to make a very brief comment here, uh...
in terms of Saddam Hussein.
Look at what Ambassador Glaspie
said all through the fall and what have you.
And look at what she and Kelly
and all the others in State said...
at the end when they were
trying to clean it up.
- We can't be this lucky.
- [Laughing]
This don't happen to me, man.
This don't happen to me.
Bush was on the defensive.
Bush was on the defensive.
Keep repeating "Bush was on the defensive"
all night.
Okay. He was.
Hell, he was on the ropes.
- Which way we going?
- This way.
- Whoo!
- Let's go!
Whoo!
Let's go. Roll.
- Heads up!
- [Laughter, Chattering]
Little news!
Where's the —
Where are we supposed to be goin', Vicki?
We gotta find out what Bush said.
Jeff, do you have a walkie-talkie?
[Man]
Be careful.
I gotta find out what Bush said.
We're ready.
Talk to Jerry real quick?
Do you mind?
What did Bush say in the last second
after Clinton did Baker?
He said, "That's what worries me."
Clinton said — the economic policy.
- Quick, before we, um —
- [Chattering]
Another good night for Bill Clinton.
Three debates, three wins.
Bush was on the defensive all night long.
I think he was put on the defensive
by Bill Clinton over the economy...
and by Ross Perot over Saddam Hussein...
and Ross Perot over the mess in Washington,
and he couldn't get out of it.
It's the record. It's the agenda.
It's the qualifications.
Governor Clinton and the Democrats
don't like when we talk about character...
but 54 of them thought
character was a very big issue...
when they rejected President Bush's
nominee for secretary of defense...
citing character insufficiencies
because he flirted with women in elevators.
There's no doubt that George Bush's
attacks on us have an effect.
The effect they're having
is on George Bush.
Negative.
See?
They're working against Bush.
[Man]
They have no effect on your campaign?
Again now, don't take my word for it.
Look at every poll that you see.
This is not a sports event.
People don't get out their peanuts
and hot dogs and rate these things.
They want to know —
Focus on the choice between
these candidates and their philosophies.
And we have tried to do that
in each debate.
We're not trying to create drama.
We are not a made-for-TV candidate.
Yes, Governor Clinton won
on Geraldo-like activities.
That's his shtick.
He's a performer. He's a phony.
I mean, he walks into the audience.
He puts Geraldo to shame.
That's not our gig. We are a leader.
We are mature.
We have a breadth and depth of experience
that's unrivaled on that stage...
and that's all we've ever tried to do...
and have been very successful
in each of these debates doing...
and you'll all be eating crow, because that's
how the American voters look at this.
They don't need another Geraldo.
They need a leader in the White House.
- Here's ABC.
- Great.
Oh, Perot came in second, not Bush.
Hey, Trish, are you sure about this?
I heard Bush was second.
I hope it was Perot.
I just got it from —
I just got it from Ricki.
Great.
[Trish] CBS is something like 35, Clinton,
29, Perot, and then the balance is Bush.
I'm going to double-check that one.
- Bush came in third in both.
- As far as I know.
- One-third undecided, one-third weak.
- Right.
- That constitutes about 18% of the electorate.
- What was the other one-third?
Two-thirds were weak Clinton,
and one-third undecided.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?
So in terms of our universe of folks,
that was a strong showing for Perot.
[Applause, Cheering]
[Clinton]
James, thank you.
Thank you, Governor.
That was a pretty good little —
- [Woman] He's counting speaking fees.
- Kodak memories.
[Laughing]
Speaking fees.
- [Clinton] I didn't humiliate him
after his morning television performance?
- No, no, no.
- No, no, we had the whole thing.
- Hi, Mama.
[Chattering]
He should do a page and a half...
that says every time
we've had it your way —
I mean, you had your chance.
We've tried it your way for the last 12 years.
It's time for a change.
But do it on every issue.
- Right.
- That should be tomorrow's rally speech.
Right.
Repeat it for jobs, for health care,
for taxes, for everything, for education.
That's the refrain
for the last three weeks.
Okay? Bye.
- [Carville Chattering]
- [Woman] Mary?
[Matalin]
Oh, the trip.
[Carville] The trip. I'm not —
I'm not gonna tell you, see, you know?
[Matalin]
You're not gonna tell me till we leave?
No, I'm just gonna tell you
the day that we're leavin'...
and how long that we're going for.

Steve Denari, who's the director

and he wants to talk
to someone confidentially.
[Hums]
Read it to me.
Well, what does names, addresses —
I can send you a fax with names, addresses,
phone numbers of who you had an affair with.
It wouldn't make it true.
Yeah, I just — Believe me —
[Carville I n Background] No, he wasn't,
but I'm just gonna tell the son of a bitch —
Believe me that it's been looked at
by every major national news organization.
Everything.
And it is completely bullshit.
If you went on the radio...
and said that Bill Clinton is the father
of an illegitimate black child...
you would be laughed at.
People would think you're crazy.
[Carville Chattering]
We're not gonna lose.
We are gonna win.
He is gonna be president.
Well, no, but, I mean —
Don't think of it like that.
Let's take it at two levels.
Number one,
of course it's not gonna matter.
But number two, think of yourself.
I guarantee you that if you do this...
you'll never work
in Democratic politics again.
Maybe you don't want to.
I'm not saying it matters.
You will be embarrassed
before the national press corps.
People will think —
Nobody will believe you...
and people will think you're scummy.
The alternative is you don't do it.
It causes you some temporary pain...
with people who tomorrow
aren't gonna matter...
and you have a campaign
that understands...
that in a difficult time
you did something right.
Um, and, you know, that's important.
I mean, it doesn't mean anything...
and we can't do anything for you specifically
or anything like that...
but you know
that you did the right thing...
and that you didn't, um...
dishonor yourself.
[Chattering, Shouting]
Oh, my God!
[Stephanopoulos]
Um, and finally, before I give him the floor...
for what I hope isn't the last time...
uh, I think we all know that, um...
besides Bill Clinton, one person
really gave this campaign focus.
And one person wrote
what I call a haiku —
[Scattered Laughter]
About five months ago:
Change versus more of the same.
The economy, stupid.
I think if you did a Nexis, it would
come up in about a thousand places.
- [All Laughing]
- And don't forget health care.
Um, you know,
I was kidding James yesterday.
I said he was about to pass...
from a role of regular human being
into the role of a legend.
[Murmuring, Chuckling]
And I think he really deserves it...
because probably for the first time
in a generation tomorrow...
we're gonna win.
And that means that more people
are gonna have better jobs.
People are gonna pay a little less
for health care, get better care...
and more kids are gonna go
to better schools.
Um, and so, thanks.
[Cheering]
[Cheering Continues]
There's a simple doctrine.
Outside of a person's love...
the most sacred thing
that they can give is their labor.
And somehow or another along the way,
we tend to forget that.
And labor is a very precious thing
that you have.
And any time that you can
combine labor with love...
you've made a merger.
And I think we're gonna win tomorrow...
and I think that the governor is gonna
fulfill his promise and change America...
and I think many of you
are gonna go on and help him.
I'm a political professional.
That's what I do for a living.
I'm proud of it.
We changed the way campaigns are run.
[Camera Shutter Clicks]
Used to be there was a hierarchy.
If you were on one floor,
you didn't go to another floor.
If you were somewhere
on the organizational chart...
there was no room for you there.
Everybody was compartmentalized.
And you people showed
that you could be trusted.
Everybody in this room. Everybody.
And people are gonna tell you you're lucky.
You're not.
Ben Hogan said, "Golf is a game of luck.
The more I practice, the luckier I get."

Oh, God.

to bring my message

- It is not that we...
have lost this battle,
it is whether we endure in a larger war.
[Laughing]
In a stunning come-from-behind upset
that shocked pundits...
political professionals, journalists,
people around the world...
- George Herbert Walker Bush —
- Was reelected today.
Proved his political resiliency
beyond any doubt whatsoever...
and was reelected today over Bill Clinton...
[Phone Ringing]
Garnering 274 electoral votes,
only four over.
But as they say, it's not horseshoes
and it's not hand grenades.
And George Bush will return —
We repeat, George Bush will return
to the White House for another four years.
- [Man] And what's the other one?
- Florida is now 42, Bush, 41.5, Clinton.
- That's what we're getting, so —
- It's started then.
- [All Talking At Once]
- You know what that means.
Uh —
Popkin talked to Warren, whatever,
the head of V.R. S...
and he's gonna talk to him in four minutes,

Could be up to 12,
maybe 400 electoral votes.

- Perot's kind of holding, isn't he?

Yeah, he held. His numbers held.
- I'm sort of surprised, frankly.
- This could be a landslide.
Probably don't have anything yet.
Let me — I gotta call Zell.

- [Stephanopoulos] Okay.
Third, which is the real
take-home point...
and I really sold on them,
which is this won't happen overnight.
- Yeah, we gotta do that.
- That's the most important point to make.
Yeah, I want a cold beer.
What kind of special today?
Well, the special today
is pepperoni and black olive.
And also we've got that 50-cent draft
Busch beer, if you want that.
- [Laughing]
- No, I don't want Busch beer.
Give me the —
Shit, I ain't drinking no Busch beer.
Give me a Budweiser.

Huh? I need a beer quickly.
Quickly, quickly.
No Busch beer.
Landslide.
[Laughing]
[Cheering]
Pennsylvania!
The governor walks out — or president.
[Chuckles]
God, I get shook up when I say it.
Walks out with Hillary and Chelsea.
They wave, they smile, they hug.
The Gores —
He then introduces the Gores.
They wave, they smile, they hug.
The Gores go sit down.
Hillary and Chelsea go sit down.
Governor gives his speech.
I can't imagine the headlines tomorrow.
I'm sorry?
The headlines tomorrow are gonna be —
We need — In that section, you've gotta
add a sentence about the young people.
- And it would be nice to have the 83-year-old —
- What section?
This section here.
It's gotta be something specifically about
how young people voted...
- in record numbers and changed —
- In record numbers. With record enthusiasm.
Their generation's gonna come —
It should come after the 83-year-old woman.
See if we can find a story in the catalog
with a young person.
[Exhales]
We gotta get him something real soon.
These changes have to be made quickly.
We gotta get it right out to him.
- How do I get it to him?
- We'll take care of it.
You like "everything"
better than "the country"?
[Man]
I'm sorry?
Do you like, "Together we can make the country
and love everything it was meant to be"...
better than "Together we can make the country
and love the country it was meant to be"?
That implies an inadequacy with the country,
doesn't it? The latter formulation?
Mm-hmm.
That's nice. That's real nice.
So just make that one change
and get it back.
Yes.
- [Man On TV]... in Massachusetts.
- [Cheering]
- Thank you. Massachusetts.
- [Applause]
More, more, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more...
- more, more, more, more, more!
- [Cheering]
More, more!
All right! Are we gonna party?
[Chattering, I ndistinct]
[Shrieks]
You're ahead with comfortable margins
in the 10 largest states in the country...
and it's just, uh — it's —
Texas, the last time we checked,
you were two up.
Thank you very much.
And now we've really got to do something.
Great. Bye-bye.
[Mutters]
- [Man] Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Congratulations.
[Stephanopoulos Exhales]
- [Man] What, um —
- How do you feel?
It's still not — You know, it's getting —
I mean, I was pretty shook up talking to him.
[Man]
What did he say?
They were giddy. It's like it didn't —
I mean, they're just like —
Are you, like, happy
or are you scared...
or are you nothing or do you
want to just, like, cry or what?
The crying was before.
Maybe it'll be later too.
No, it's just like... floating.
- James.
- What?
- On your chest in front of you —
- This one?
Your white one is totally unnecessary
because that beige one in your hand —
Okay. This is the everywhere pass?
That is a very exclusive... There are only
about five of those in existence.
- Okay.
- And it gets you backstage with the governor.
- Where am I supposed to meet them? What room?
- There are only about five.
- I-I-I —
- You don't know?
In the director's office of the State House.
But it's almost impossible to get there
because there are so many...
tens of thousands of people
out on the street.
I'll meet you out here.
I'm just going to use the ladies' room.
[Carville] We don't know how we're
gonna get there through the crowd.
♪♪ [Rock: Man Singing]
- [Carville] Excuse me, please. Excuse me.
- [Mandy] That one girl got in.
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm very proud to have done this.
I'm as happy as I can be
and I'm so proud.
We won Nevada big.
Governor, we're gonna —
I mean, it's looking like close to 400.
It's a landslide.
Ohio's not called yet.
North Carolina's not called yet.
But everything else —
I mean, Michigan —
Dead even in Florida.
You know, it's just unbelievable.
You oughta be the —
I mean, the happiest man in the world.
And I just gotta tell you,
I just appreciate this so much.
This was the best thing I ever did.
We can try. He's up there talking now
though, you know.
He's up there giving his speech. Yep.
You don't?
But the one thing you gotta be —
We really want you to say
whatever you want to say tonight...
but you just gotta be careful
about being too programmatic.
You should definitely be New Democrat,
and we love Hillary's new patriotism thing...
which he tried to put in there.
Also you gotta do at the end,
he goes back to the announcement speech...
which is very important.
But you know, just say what —
Speak from your heart tonight.
I mean, that's all that matters.
Say what you want to say.
I mean, this is your night.
Okay. We'll see you in a little bit.
Bye-bye.
- He's like —
- What, is he gone?
He's asking...
"I think we got Nevada!"
[All Laughing]
- Follow Richard.
- [Chattering]
- Follow Richard.
- Okay, Richard knows where he's going here.
He's pretty pumped.
I mean, it's unbelievable.
- He should be.
- Yeah.
What did he say when you said
"Mr. President"?
- He said, "Thanks."
- He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
- "Yeah, yeah. How'd we do in Nevada?"
- [Both Laughing]
[Crowd Cheering, Applauding]
And finally I want to thank...
the members of my brilliant,
aggressive, unconventional...
but always winning campaign staff.
[Cheering]
[Clinton]
And they have earned this.
