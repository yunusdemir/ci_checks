We kept Durst down here.
He had the TV up there.
He had one shower.
There's two cells
for two people,
but he was always in here
by himself.
He slept in that cell.
In prison,
you're not going to get
a whole bunch
of rich people in there.
I mean,
most people in prison are from lower,
lower income families,
not educated.
I got along
with those people well.
They all treated me
with enormous respect.
I was Mr. Bob in prison.
What they accomplished
in their lives,
whatever it might have been,
they accomplished on their own.
I'll never do anything
on my own.
It'll always be this thing
or all this money
or whatever it is.
No matter what I do in my life,
I will have started out rich.
60-year-old Robert Durst
sits in a Texas jail now
charged with the gruesome death
of his neighbor two years ago.
Texas authorities
aren't the only ones
interested in Durst.
In New York,
police continue to investigate
the 1982 disappearance
of his first wife Kathleen,
and police in Los Angeles
also want to talk to him
about the unsolved murder
of friend Susan Berman
in December of 2000.
I got a case,
but I can't prove it quite yet,
and for New York,
they got a case.
They... They ain't got a body,
and, uh, but to us,
it was Galveston
had the best of all cases.
Robert Durst is charged in Texas
with the murder of Morris Black,
not only murdering him,
but dismembering him
and throwing his body
in the Galveston Bay.
They had the evidence.
The conviction
would be gotten in Texas.
Durst dismembered the body,
put it in garbage bags,
and threw it in the river.
I mean, how do you defend this?
It would seem to be a home run
for the prosecution.
Robert Durst
shot and killed Morris Black,
dismembered him,
and threw him away like trash.
That was our focus.
Nobody deserves to be killed
and their head cut off,
their arms cut off,
their legs cut off,
and packaged up like garbage.
The evidence, the totality
of the circumstances of this
case pointed us to one charge
and one charge only,
and that was murder.
Legendary
Texas lawyer Dick DeGuerin
heads the billionaire's
high-powered defense team.
I think it's a beautiful
day in Galveston.
That's all I can say.
I always
get nervous before a trial.
I always worry about
maybe there's something
I should have done I didn't do,
and often I'm right about that.
There were
moments where you kind of
gagged on what you had
gotten yourself into.
We've got a guy cut up
in 20 different pieces
thrown in a bay,
and they're expecting us to win this case.
Good? 3, 2, 1. 3, 2, 1.
An eccentric
New York real estate heir
is on trial in Texas.
In a Galveston court,
Robert Durst
is looking back at a murky past
catching up to him.
This has been the last
20 years of my life,
and it's beginning
to have closure.
We were getting requests
from so many media
from around the country...
<i>People</i> magazine
and the New York papers
and television stations,
and, of course,
you have your local media,
You have your TV stations
from Houston.
The <i>Post</i> had a stringer there.
AP was in there.
The <i>Daily News</i>
sent over an editor.
I mean,
everybody saw it as a big story.
The tabloid press
can't seem to get enough
of the multi-millionaire
accused of murder.
So I go to the courtroom,
and at some level,
I felt sorry for Bob.
I mean, he looked at me.
He gave me this little smile.
It wasn't a malicious,
"Ha ha! I'm gonna get you next" smile.
It was just kind of like this
little smile of recognition.
I never forgave him
for murdering Kathie.
It was just some element
of feeling sorry for him.
His life just unraveled
to such a pitiful degree.
All rise, please.
Good morning.
You may all be seated.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, the defendant
Robert Durst stands charged
by indictment
with the offense of murder.
The defendant has pleaded
not guilty.
We're ready to proceed.
Morning.
The burden of proof
is on the state
to prove to you
beyond a reasonable doubt
that Robert Durst intentionally
shot and killed Morris Black.
Look at these pictures.
This is what Mr. Durst
did to Morris Black...
Cut the skin all the way to the bone,
pulled the...
Pulled the tissue
and the muscle back,
get to the bone, and saw it off.
Flipped the body over
a couple of times because,
"I got to get around
the other side, too,
"and I got to do the legs.
Then I got to do the head"...
motivated to get away
with murder.
I'd never seen
anything like that, you know?
So you think, you know,
it's no big deal, but it's...
Uh, it's... It's shocking.
At the start,
what I felt in my gut was,
it was a murder because he had
to get rid of the evidence
by cutting him up and throwing
him in the Gulf or whatever.
Two local officers were called
to the stand today,
one a diver for the Galveston County
Sheriff's Department
who talked about where Morris Black's
body parts were found
in Galveston Bay.
Sitting back
in New York watching this
with my colleagues, I would say,
"Well, what's his defense
going to be?"
and they would
almost unanimously say,
"It doesn't matter what his
defense is because he's guilty
"and they're going to find him
guilty because he cut up
the body and, therefore,
he's going to be found guilty,"
and all I would say is, "Look.
"The guy's got
unlimited resources.
"He's got a very smart lawyer.
It's a publicity case.
He's gonna have some defense."
Bob has feelings.
This is his first girlfriend.
He'd been carrying that picture
with him.
He had it when he was arrested.
That's the pictures of his wedding,
he and Kathie.
He had them
when he was arrested.
And there's a picture of Bob
as a young boy.
He had them
when he was arrested.
When I first met Bob,
he was not loud.
He was not even
terribly responsive,
but he had an intelligence.
He had some wit to him.
He's disheveled.
He's been through the mill.
He's been held in circumstances
in which he's never been,
but you have to look past that
and see this lump of clay here
that I'm going to have to mold.
Has it got the capacity
to be molded into the shape
that I want it to be in
by the time we get to a jury?
I thought he was going to make
a pretty good defendant.
Our first witness, Your Honor, is Bob Durst.
Mr. Durst, would you come forward please?
When
the defense opened their case
and called Durst
as a first witness,
I was shocked.
Mr. Durst, something happened
on October the 31 st of the year 2000
that turned your world upside down.
I learned that New York City tabloids
were going to do
a new story about
the disappearance of Kathie Durst.
So what did you want to do?
It seemed to me
the big problem was Robert Durst
and that I wanted to not be Robert Durst.
They had
to explain why he was on the run
before he even killed
Morris Black.
He was living on the run,
so to speak, when he came here.
He's hiding out.
He's wearing disguises.
He's living
this bizarre lifestyle.
What did you intend to do?
I intended to go to Galveston
and disguise myself
and never use the name Robert Durst again.
The people
who actually live in Galveston,
this tiny town
at the end of I-45
where the sign says,
literally, "Mile 0,"
those people go there
to get lost.
What did you learn about this story
and who was pushing it?
Jeanine Pirro was going to use
a new investigation of
Robert Durst to further her career.
Jeanine Pirro
ran him out of New York,
and I say that without fear
of contradiction.
That's what happened.
Bob was driven from New York
by a politically ambitious woman
who wanted to further
her own ambition
at Bob Durst's expense
with no evidence.
DeGuerin down there
is making <i>me</i> the focus
so that no one focuses
on what Robert Durst did.
It was very easy for us
to make her the enemy.
We kind of created this mythical
character in Jeanine Pirro,
and we took liberty
with how directly
she was involved
with that pursuit of Bob.
And until you've seen
your picture on the front page
of the newspaper being accused
of having something to do
with the disappearance
of a loved one,
you don't know
what it feels like.
If Miss Pirro
kept her mouth shut,
none of this
would have happened.
Are you kidding?
Well, I've heard,
"The devil made me do it."
I never heard,
"The DA made me do it."
They lied.
And that message played well.
The jury, they ate that one up.
Well, it kind of made sense
a little bit
when we were told that,
you know, he was trying
to get out of New York because
Jeanine Pirro was after him.
I think that she was really out to...
To get him,
and with having the pressure on,
you know, he wanted to get away,
and, you know,
I can't fault him for that.
What do you decide to do?
I decided that I would
disguise myself as a woman,
buy a wig, like that.
Did you buy a dress?
No.
In terms of the
disguise that you chose,
you know,
you talked about that in Galveston.
Well, it was the only
disguise I could think of.
I'm a guy.
And what is a guy going to do?
I mean,
I could grow a beard and a mustache,
and I'd periodically
worn a beard
and a mustache in New York City,
but I can't grow a beard
and a mustache now,
can't do it by tomorrow morning.
I would have to get
some kind of a thing
to put on my face,
and I just couldn't imagine
that any of that
would act vaguely real.
I just came up with
the idea of a wig,
and then,
since I'm going to be a woman,
I've got to be mute
because I cannot
sound the way I sound.
Um, I mean, in retrospect now...
That was a great disguise.
I went to Walmart and
I bought a woman's white blouse
and a woman's handbag.
I heard the jury laugh,
and I remembered talking to Joel.
I leaned over to Joel,
and I ask him,
"Did they just laugh
at this man?"
and it was
a defining moment for me.
I felt like, "Oh, my goodness,
if they, the defense team,
"had set out to
humanize him in some way
"after he'd dismembered Morris Black,
murdered him,
"and ran with his I.D.
and did everything he had done,
they were looking like they
were being successful at it."
You're now living in this
apartment in Galveston.
Did you meet Morris Black?
I was going out,
dressed as a mute woman,
and a man came out of the door
to the apartment across the hall.
He said that I should not
leave the hall light on,
because the hall light
was on his electric meter.
I guess I had nodded and I left.
No one knew a great deal
about Morris
because he was, uh, a loner.
Every time I say the word
"cantankerous" and "grumpy,"
I see Morris' face.
There was a guy that lived
in the house next door
that used to sit on the porch
and smoke his cigarette,
and Morris Black would walk
down the street and yell at him
for smoking on his porch.
In the days and weeks to come,
what sort of relationship
developed between you and Morris?
We became good friends.
If you stop and think about it,
if it weren't
such a tragic situation,
it would be kind of
an amusing one...
Morris out in front
like a terrier dog bitin'
and snippin' at various people,
and...
And Bob walking behind...
Generally a little bit toked up,
uh, uh,
kind of cooling things down.
Uh, it's an odd couple.
It's an odd situation.
Did you and Morris fall
into kind of a routine?
Yes. We would watch TV...
The businessy program
called Wall Street Week.
Then go out for coffee,
usually to the E-Street Coffee Haus
And did you wear the disguise?
No, I decided that I was not
going to wear the disguise...
Why not?
It was just too uncomfortable.
Was there ever
a moment when he said,
"Hey,
for the last couple of weeks,
"you've been writing me
notes and wearing a wig.
Now you're not
writing notes."
Well, well, we became friendlier
as time went on
in the following months.
He asked about,
"How come you, you know,
"were here wearing a...
Why'd you rent the apartment
as Dorothy Signer?"
and like that,
and I told him I wanted
to disappear and hide,
and I think, "I'm... I'm hiding.
I don't find anybody
recognizing me."
And did he judge in any way?
Did he say, "Oh,
it's a weird thing to do,
or..."
No.
It was just the opposite.
He said, "Yeah, yeah.
I did that a long time ago."
Didn't say he changed his name
or he dressed like a woman or...
But, yeah,
when I said I just didn't want
to be Robert Durst anymore,
he said,
"Yeah.
I went through that."
Did you own guns?
The 9mm pistol I was arrested with here,
and one of the two revolvers
that I was arrested with in Pennsylvania.
And a .22 target shooting pistol.
Did you and Morris ever
have a discussion about guns?
Well, I don't know who brought it up,
but we were both familiar with guns.
We both liked to target shoot.
Part of the defense
was the famous
"he had it coming" defense,
where Morris Black
was such a bad guy in so many
different ways and so crazy,
so touched in so many different
ways that we could prove.
Let's go to Monday, September the 17th.
Something very disturbing
happened that day,
something very unusual.
Well, we were in my apartment,
and Morris showed me an eviction notice.
And, I could tell he was very upset about it.
And, I had gone into the bathroom
and I heard a gunshot.
A gunshot?
Alright, and then what did you see?
I saw Morris standing there
and I said, "Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!"
"Did you shoot the gun? Put the gun down!"
He pointed up at
the archway to the kitchen
and he said that he had just
shot at the eviction notice.
What did you say to him?
I said, "I want you to get out of here."
"I don't want you in here."
Did you make it clear to him
that he wasn't to ever come back in there?
Oh, I made it very clear.
What were dealing with
is an unpredictable
and violent man,
one given to fits of rage,
one given to bizarre conduct.
That's the reason he comes in.
We're not here to blacken
the name of a dead man.
There's an old joke in Texas...
They hang horse thieves
and let murderers go.
That's because they don't have
any horses that need stealing.
Uh, we do have some people
that need killing.
Now, let's go to September the 28th.
What happened when
you got to 2213 Avenue K?
I opened the front door of the building.
What did you notice?
My TV was on.
What did you do?
I opened up the door.
Morris was sitting at the table
and he was angry at me.
Bob, I want to ask you to step down
and demonstrate what
happened from that point.
What did you see?
Morris had swiveled the chair.
Keep your voice up!
Morris had swiveled the chair halfway
towards me and was looking at me.
And what did he do?
As he started turning
towards me, I kept saying
"Morris, where's the gun?"
"Give me the gun. Give me the gun."
And I got up...
What did Morris do as you got up?
He turned more and more
towards me with the gun.
Judging from his standpoint,
if you were in his shoes
and you came to your house,
to your apartment, your home...
and you found Morris Black
in there without your permission
and you knew what we all
know now about Morris Black
and Morris Black went for a gun,
would you be
reasonable in being in fear?
Would you be reasonable
in coming to your own defense?
In the State of Texas,
you find somebody
in your house who's
not supposed to be there,
there's not much
you cannot do to them.
Most other states,
what you're obligated to do
is to call the police,
do something else.
You're obligated to leave.
Texas,
you're not obligated to leave.
You can handle it more
or less as you see fit.
Obviously,
you're not supposed to kill them.
We always
had to keep Bob on message.
Uh, "You were afraid of him.
"You were afraid
of what he would do,
"and you knew you had to get
your hands on that gun
or something
could happen to you."
That was the case.
So, we had the gun like this,
and he was pushing it like that,
and then we fell.
Okay, that's sort of close.
As you hit the floor,
and as your elbow hit, what happened?
The gun went off.
Barn! Like that?
Like that.
And so they go into the fight
and the struggle,
and they turned,
and he fell over the chair,
and this happened
and put it in the...
And they went through
this whole thing.
I mean, you know,
it felt like I was watching
something in theater,
and then he shot him.
Accidentally, the gun went off.
I said, "Yeah. All right."
I'm looking at the jury...
And then I hear
the district attorney.
So I'm thinking, "Okay. Yeah.
They've got
a really great case."
At some point, this gun,
it has to turn and face you,
does it not?
Yes, sir.
And it's your testimony that,
what?
But let's remember,
you were facing that way.
That's right.
I'm facing this way.
Right.
The way you had it was...
Was what happened.
The gun turns,
and it's just like this?
Is this your testimony,
that it goes...
Oh, I can't say
that's my testimony.
The two of you
look like spaghetti,
is the truth of the matter.
Mr. Black kind of looked like
bloody spaghetti, didn't he?
No. He didn't look
like bloody spaghetti.
You just don't remember
how you were standing?
I remember a whole lot better
than this demonstration
is doing it.
The man sitting before you
cannot tell the truth.
You were told that he and Morris
would go to places.
Not one person told you
they saw those two together ever.
It was convenient for him to say,
yeah,
they were best friends
and they were best buds,
but I never found one person
that ever saw them
go anywhere together.
If it came
out of Bob Durst's mouth
and Bob Durst's mouth alone,
I don't believe it.
At some point during the summer,
did Morris Black become aware
you had a lot of money?
I know he knew it after I told him that
my correct name was Robert Durst.
Morris would go to the library
every day
and he would use the Internet
for free.
I think he discovered
who Durst was
and his family's background
and their money.
At some point, he told Durst that,
"If you don't help me,
I'm going to tell New York
where you're at,"
and I think that
is what got him killed.
There are areas of bruising
across the shoulders,
multiple red-brown bruises
occasionally blending together.
This is not one blow.
These are multiple blows
across the top of the shoulder.
Let's talk about the bruises
on the top of his shoulders.
I don't know where he got the bruises.
I can only say we fell down.
You had nothing to do with
the bruises on the middle of his back?
If he got them when we fell down,
then he got them when we fell down.
You don't get multiple
blows from falling one time.
Those injuries are not
consistent with self-defense.
Didn't happen the way
he told you it happened.
Mr. Durst, you heard the neighbor say
that she heard two shots, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
You have any explanation for that?
No, sir.
There's
a bullet hole in the wall
that was leading from
the living room to the kitchen.
You were told that Morris Black
shot the eviction letter.
There's no bullet holes in it.
There's a bullet hole
in the wall
because Robert Durst
shot and missed Morris Black.
He shot, he missed,
he beat him to the ground,
and he executed him.
You don't cut somebody up,
another human being,
into pieces and bag him up,
dump him in the bay,
when you act in self-defense.
It just doesn't happen.
You don't butcher somebody,
put him in pieces, bag him up,
dump him in the bay
because there's an accident.
It was explained to me
that I was gonna have to do
the dismemberment...
There was no way around it...
but I think maybe even my
lawyers had a vague suspicion.
"Well, he's not going to be able
to get through this.
"We're going to get
to the dismemberment,
and he's just gonna, "Ach.""
Now, Morris is dead. What was your reaction?
I sat down on the bed and I looked at Morris
and I just put my head in my hands.
Kept thinking, "I've gotta get my head up.
I have to pick my head up."
And then, Mr. Durst, did you
in fact get your head up?
Yes, sir.
Why didn't you call the police, Mr. Durst?
I kept going over the situation in my mind.
Morris was shot in the face with my gun,
in my apartment.
The police were immediately going to
look into who am I, Robert Durst,
who happened to rent this
apartment disguised as a woman.
They're going to find out there's all this
media attention on him back in New York.
I just didn't think I would be believed.
I didn't think they would believe me.
I was scared to death.
I couldn't leave this corpse
in my apartment.
I couldn't...
I had to get this corpse
out of my apartment, period.
So what did you decide to do
to get rid of the body?
Well,
I decided I'd wait till night
and then I'd pick it up
and carry it out of there,
and then I realized I wasn't
picking up that body
and carrying it anywhere
because it was much...
I mean, I wasn't
strong enough to do that.
I could drag it out,
but I just couldn't see...
I mean,
I thought about putting it
in a sleeping bag or something
and then dragging
the whole thing out,
but, good God,
that's ridiculous.
What did you intend to
do with Morris himself?
I got this idea that I was going to cut it in half.
Mr. Durst did you,
during the course of that day,
dismember Mr. Morris Black's body?
Yes, sir.
Now, Morris had tools.
He had saws and...
And, um, axes, a giant ax.
Uh, I don't think he had a...
I don't think he had a bow saw.
Anyway,
I went and bought a bow saw
and then a bunch of garbage bags
and stuff like that
and went back to...
To the house,
and I'm sure I got more stoned
and more drunk,
and I dismembered the corpse
primarily with the ax
but some with the bow saw
and, I think,
another saw that Morris Black had.
What did you do with the parts of the body?
I put them in garbage bags.
You put the garbage bags in your car?
Yes, sir.
Ultimately, later that night,
did you take those bags to
the location on Channelview Drive
you described here?
Yes, sir.
Did you throw them all
in the same place, there?
Yes, sir.
And the suitcase that
Morris Black's torso was in...
Wait a minute, I thought you said
that everything was in garbage bags.
Was there a suitcase involved?
Yes, the torso was in a suitcase.
One of these... what kind of suitcase?
One of these giant Walmart suitcases.
We worked for days, many days,
getting him ready
for the kind of questions
I knew were going to be coming
on cross-examination.
"Tell us about
what it was like, sir.
"Where did you start to cut
on Morris Black?
"Did you cut his arm off first,
"or did you cut
his leg off first?
"What did you use to cut the leg with?
Show us.
"What part of his leg
did you saw on first, Mr. Durst,
your friend
that you were cutting up?"
There was a concern
on our part that, um...
the way he sometimes
describes things, um,
without a lot of emotion,
hearing him describe
the technical dissection
of that body would
lead someone to believe
he's a cold-blooded killer.
Can you tell us how long it took
to out Morris Black up?
I don't know.
Can you tell us where you started?
Arms? Legs? Head?
I don't remember.
It was very
important to say, "Bob, look.
"Your memory is very fuzzy.
"Your memory on this
is naturally repressed.
"We've had psychiatrists,
psychologists see you.
"They'll all agree.
"For such a horrific event,
it's very common
"that you don't remember
all the details.
Don't try to."
Your knives were getting a little dull
weren't they, Mr. Durst?
I...
...don't remember.
Don't remember?
Don't remember.
Well, you were still thinking about ways
to get away from this killing, weren't you?
I did not kill my best friend.
I did dismember him.
Took the body parts,
put them in the garbage bags,
and drove to find some place
to dump the garbage bags,
and it immediately became
obvious to me
I can dump them in the water.
It'll sink.
Nobody will have seen them.
The garbage bags are heavy.
That's what I did.
It was very important to you
that those bags sank, wasn't it?
Yes, sir.
If they floated up,
you had a problem, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
Had you done any work
to try to figure out
whether the tide
was coming in,
the tide was coming out?
I wouldn't know how to begin.
So you basically just
decided you were gonna...
I figured it was deep.
I'm gonna drop it,
it's gonna sink.
Who cares where
the tide is going?
It's underwater.
Nobody's gonna see it.
Right, but the bags didn't sink.
- No.
- What happened?
They floated.
You came back early early
the next day, before the police, did you not?
And see the bags floating?
Yes, sir.
And you panicked, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
You had a problem, because the head was
going to be discovered, didn't you, Mr. Durst?
I thought everything was
going to be discovered.
At the dump site that evening,
there was a bag with a right leg
and a bag with a left leg,
right arm, left arm,
and a torso.
But there
was one bag that had obviously
been sliced open not just
with a rock or something,
but some kind
of sharp instrument.
And the
only thing that was missing
from everything that was there
was Morris Black's head.
It was clear to us
that when Durst realized
the bags were floating,
he cut the bag,
picked up the head,
and he took off.
He knew the head was the most
important piece of evidence
about what happened
in that apartment.
There was
no wrestling over the gun.
I think he shoved Morris down
and he shot him
in the back of the head,
and can I prove that?
No, not without the head.
- All right.
- You all may be seated.
Mr. Lewis,
you may proceed.
This case is not
about what happened
to Morris Black's body
after he was dead.
This case is not about
what Bob Durst did
after Morris Black died.
The sole issue for you
ladies and gentlemen to decide
is how Morris Black died.
We started
getting over to the jurors
this thought about,
"It doesn't change what happened
"to Morris Black,
anything that Bob Durst
did with the body afterwards."
They... They put in front of
the jury about a thousand times,
"Was there anything
that Robert Durst could do
"after finding Morris Black dead to...
To prevent his death
or to change the manner
in which he died?" And they...
They brought up
about a zillion examples.
"Can you unstrike a match? No.
"Can you unring a bell?
No.
"If somebody's dead,
is there anything you can do
"to prevent him from dying?
No."
There is no charge
of dismemberment of the corpse.
There is no charge
of destruction of evidence,
nothing that the state
keeps trying to focus you on.
They have to focus you on that
because how Morris Black died...
Self-defense, an accident...
They have woefully failed
to meet their burden.
Their plea that they
came up with,
accidental and self-defense,
is brilliant
because if it's just
two people in a room,
how do you disprove
self-defense?
There was a moment
during my cross-examination
of Cody Cazalas that I thought
was extremely important,
and, to his credit,
he answered honestly.
You know that it's the prosecution's burden,
once self-defense is raised,
to disprove self-defense,
don't you?
Yes, sir.
And, you found no evidence that would
disprove self-defense, did you?
No, sir.
Sergeant Cazalas
told you the truth.
That man told you
what the State of Texas
doesn't want to talk about.
Their burden to disprove
beyond all reasonable doubt,
according to their lead detective,
they can't meet it.
Every little saw mark in each
and every one of those leg bones
and arm bones has got
a whole lot of intent in it,
a whole lot of intent of a man
who's getting away with murder.
The state's burden is to prove
to you beyond a reasonable doubt
that Bob Durst
had his finger on the trigger
when the gun went off
and killed Morris Black.
Look at every piece of evidence
you heard and consider it.
You can't segment it
and only look
at certain portions of it
and ignore everything else.
That's not proper.
Possibly guilty.
Probably guilty.
We all talked about that.
What that means is not guilty.
What kind of criminal justice
system are we gonna have
when we can't consider
everything that happened
after, during, and before?
It all goes to the man's
state of mind.
It all goes to his intent.
Bob Durst is not guilty
of murder.
Bob Durst is not guilty
of murder.
Whatever else he may have done
is for another time and place.
Thank you all.
Now to a
courthouse in Galveston, Texas,
where jurors still
have not reached a verdict
in the bizarre murder trial of
real estate heir Robert Durst.
The trial itself lasted 6 weeks.
Some people here are beginning
to worry that the jury
might take that long to decide
whether Robert Durst
is guilty of murder.
You may be seated.
Mr. Foreman,
I understand you have a verdict.
Yes, your honor.
Will you hand it to the bailiff?
Will the defendant please rise?
Well,
the verdict of the jury is such.
"We, the jury,
find the defendant Robert Durst
not guilty."
Is there anything the attorneys
would like to say at this point?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
We also thank the jury
for the sacrifice of their time.
Thank you for all your time
and attention
and your sacrifice.
All right,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
This is what the procedure is
that we are going to follow.
First of all,
we're going to take you back
into the jury room...
Did they say, "Not?"
Yes.
Are you sure?
- What we did...
- And it was a big struggle for all of us...
Is, we kept going
back to the charge
that was put forth to the jury
as to the actual event,
that one moment in time.
It was a very unpopular
occurrence when the...
When Bob Durst
was found not guilty.
The townspeople, friends,
relatives,
they weren't happy
with the verdict
that was brought forward,
but when Mr. Durst was on the,
uh, stand...
I felt he was talking
from the heart.
Through the course of the 5 days
of deliberation, Bob never...
He never had more than 3
guilty votes the whole time.
The last one
that changed their mind,
she had a problem finding him
not guilty
because he had
chopped up the body,
and I could understand that.
She was a...
She was a good Christian woman,
very nice lady, but I just said,
"You know, that's...
"That's not what we're
here to do.
"We're here to determine
"if the event
that killed Morris Black
"was murder or not,
not what happened
to his body after
he was already dead."
I said, "We've got to...
That's our job."
As a homicide investigator,
you work for God
because the victim's not there
to tell his story.
You're there to represent
the victim.
You're there to tell his story.
You're doing that for God.
Um...
there's a lot of truth in that.
To this day,
I feel like I let the...
Can we stop? Thanks.
You told me on the telephone
that DeGuerin might not
want me to talk to you
because he wouldn't
want to see you
in an interview saying
that you had lied
to the jury in Galveston.
Well, they didn't know
what I was gonna say.
So, I mean,
they've always felt that, you know,
they got this home run now.
Now, I get out there
and I say something
that implies that
I made it all up
or that I told the lawyers
and that we all got together
and made it all up or whatever,
that's a disaster.
So they just wanted
to stay away,
and they said about
a zillion times,
"You can't help yourself.
"Right now,
you're a free man 100%.
"You say something
inadvertently,
"and you'll find yourself
charged in New York
"or charged in, uh, Los Angeles,
"and, uh,
an interview is a big risk for you.
Why do you want
to do an interview?"
Certainly,
you've said to me that you did lie
to the jury in Galveston
in some way,
that your lawyer
encouraged you to,
and I think that's...
Well, he didn't encourage me to.
We went over the oath,
and from day one,
the oath says,
"You, uh,
promise to tell the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."
"Just make sure
the ones at the end...
"'Tell the truth,
nothing but the truth'...
"That you do exactly that.
"In terms of 'the whole truth, '
"if you want to leave out
something that does not...
"Uh, which makes you
look bad if you tell it
"but does not turn into an untruth,
well, try it.
"Try it.
"If there's something
so terrible that you
"don't want to say it
or you think could
be construed the wrong way,
then just leave it out."
I'm saying,
was there something that was
relevant in Galveston that,
you know,
would have had an influence,
where you knew
that you were saying
something that was limited?
Let me see what else
I can think of
where they didn't
specifically ask it
and I specifically
didn't go there.
I'd have to think about it.
Next time you interview me,
I'll have that, and I'll...
I'll think of a few things.
Shall we take a break
for a few minutes?
- Want to take a break?
- Sure.
Take a break.
There's coffee now.
Sign this.
Okay. Thank you,
and there's orange juice and...
I did not knowingly
purposefully lie.
I don't know, but the room...
The room is the same
room we had,
the absolute same.
I did not knowingly
purposefully lie.
Yeah,
and then they're pissed off
with this shit.
Right.
I did not knowingly purposefully
intentionally lie.
I did make mistakes.
So I told...
They could just hear every word you said...
What?
...when you were talking to yourself.
Your mic is hot, so we can't really talk.
Oh, oh, oh.
I was reviewing...
Your mic picks everything up.
I hear what you're saying.
You could hear
everything I said.
I never intently...
I mean, how do I...
I mean, you know,
it's a question
of not what do I say,
but how do I say it.
I never intentionally
purposefully lied.
I made mistakes,
did not tell the whole truth.
Nobody tells the whole truth.
