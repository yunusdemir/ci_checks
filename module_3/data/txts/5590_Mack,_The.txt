Tips from the blind man

How much you wanna bet?
- Wait a minute!
I got money, I got money!
I got money everywhere!
Goddamn you sure is right
If you cant count you should't play
Rock something
Pass on, then
You got no business
being here no way
Shut up.
The game is out there, Goldie
just waiting for you
You can be a player
perhaps one of the best
You see, you were
one of my best boys
The sharpest
I hated losing you
You didnt really lose me, man
The cat just hid me
away in his prison...
and threw the key out the window
Yeah, well that deal
was set up wrong
Those other niggers didnt have
no business being out there
No way It was a set-up
I used tollie inh that stinky-aass
four-by-five cell,
Looking at those dark walls
and I don't care how much
I let it run through my head
it always ended up the same way
I'd always end up
hanging upside down
in that stupid car looking
at that stupid-ass cop
We gonna change all that now
We're gonna put you up
on your feet again
You'll have a bankroll so big
when you walk down the street
it'll look like your pocket's
got the mumps
I aint never had
those kind of mumps
Remember...
a pimp is only as good
as his product, see?
And his product is women
You got to go out there
and you got to get
the best ones you can find
You got to work them broads like
nobody's ever worked them before
And never forget--
anybody can control
a woman's body, see
but the key is to control her mind
You see pimpin' is big business
It's been going on since
the beginning of time
and it's gonna continue
straight ahead...
till somebody up there
turns out the lights
on this small planet.
Can you dig it?
Yeah, yeah I can dig it
Right on
Mind if l--
Goldie!
Lulu!
God damn, baby!
I was just thinking about you
a couple of days ago, man!
Look at you Wow!
You look pretty good
Let me buy you a drink
- Okay
Wow!
When did they let you out?
- I just got in town
Wow--goddamn, yyou look good
to me, do you hear me?
You look so good. How long
has it been about five years?
No, it's been four years,
349 days,
two hours and 20 minutes,
Wow, it must have been
awful funky,
'cause you got it down
to the minutes,
No, no,
it was okay,
I kind of dug it,
you know?
I really dug it,
I'm a time freak,
Come on,
I cant really joke about that,
It was a bitch,
It was a bitch, baby,
you know?
They turn you into an animal,
then they talk all that
"rehabilitation" shit, you know?
Why are we talking about me?
We know where live been,
You can look at my shirt, right?
What you been doing?
What you been into?
Nothing much--
just trying to get over,
turning a few tricks here and there,
Wow...
When I was up in that place,
I used to do all sorts of fantasies
and dreams about you,
I used to picture you
as a big-time nurse,
or a lawyer,
or something heavy like that,
That would be righteously
together if I was white,
But I dont have to tell you
how hard it is
for a nigger to earn a decent living,
Besides, it's just a job
that pays the bills,
Yeah, them bills
do have to be paid,
You know, Goldie, there are a lot
of people who dont dig me,
What are you talking about?
- You know I'm an outlaw,
A lot of the pimps are down on me
'cause I wont choose,
Goldie, you know,
I need a man,
I need somebody in my corner,
Not just because I'm paying him,
but somebody to be there,
Do you think I'm wrong?
No. I dont think you're wrong at all,
Help me, then,
Goldie,
Man. I-- I'm tired
of being by myself,
Man, I need you,
Man, you'll never regret it,
I'll do anything do you hear me?
Anything--everything
that you ask me to do,
You'll never have
to look behind you--
I'll always be there,
Goldie,
please help me,
I gotta think about it.
It might just work.
Hey, man,
I gotta split now,
I gotta go catch this little trick,
Why dont you come by
the pad a little later?
It'll be like you never left,
Goldie, please?
Later, baby,
Go do what you gotta do,
You know,
go ahead,
Hip, hip...
- Hooray,
Hip, hip...
- Hooray,
Welcome home,
You remember us,
we're your friendly neighborhood
police officers,
If youive got any problems,
come to us,
Okay?
We're here to serve you,
Any problems at all--
rape, murder...
selling dope, robbery-- anything,
We want you to do something,
Anything.
We're looking forward to it,
You made our jobs interesting,
It's been fuckin' dull.
Listen--there's a guy
around the corner...
he's selling dope,
Why dont you go get yourself a fix,
and my partner and l
will bust your ass?
Okay?
Perfect,
You lousy punk!
I should have finished you off
in the junkyard,
Next time,
I'll pull the trigger,
I'll blow your head off!
Easy!
You pissed him off,
You're always pissing him off!
Now you listen to me, boy,
You breathe too deep,
you blink once too often,
I'm gonna make you
look like an ad
for Swiss cheese!
Okay?
Look at yourself,
Goldie,
Look at yourself,
You used to be a sharp dresser--
you're a mess!
Get your shit together,
brother,
Mama...?
Goldie?
Goldie, baby?
Is it really you?
How are you doini,
lady?
Thank God,
Let me look at you,
You've gotten thin,
I can feel--
I havent lost any weight,
live always been skinny,
Oh, honey,
it's so good to have you,
It's good to be here, Mama,
Oh, Goldie,
I thought about you every day,
I dreamed about you
almost every night,
You were always on my mind,
always beside me,
You know, sometimes
I'd be sitting in church
and I'd see your face
right in front of me,
I tried to imagine where you were
and what you were doing,
I tried to understand
why you were there,
I said to myself,
"Why did l bring us here? i, i
Mama, we didnt have a choice,
After Daddy was killed,
we had to leave Alabama,
Goldie... what are you
gonna do now?
Why dont you fix me
something to eat?
Can you fix me something?
I havent had anything all day,
I have plenty of food,
Come on,
I need to fatten you up anyway,
I want you to look me
straight in the eyes
and tell me what you're gonna do,
Mama, look--
I'm gonna make a lot of money,
I'm gonna buy you nice things
and get you out of here,
I'm gonna buy the things
I promised you,
Son, please, come to church
with me and pray with me,
Mama. I'm tired
of praying in church,
I spent five years in prison,
I gotta go out and fight that man
the only way I know,
Goldie?
- Yeah?
Please...
please take care of yourself,
I'm gonna take care
of myself,, okay?
Take care of yourself, son,
I'm gonna take care of you, too,
I really am,
Aw, look at you,
look at you,
Kinda silly,
isn't it?
You look so pretty
with all that water on your face,
Iive loved you for a long time, lady,
Goldie, Goldie...
Come here, come here,
Dont do that,
So you must first of all remember,
this system was not originally...
designed with Black
people in mind,
Right on, brother!
Right on!
And it definitely was not prepared
for Black people to, in the end,
begin to demand their rights
and an equal share in this country
which theyive died for,
Right on!
Hey--and we definitely
are not going back to Africa
Right on! Right on, brother!
We aint goini back!
For us to exist in this system,
we must first of all realize
that we have got to form
our own Black America,
within-- but without--
white America.
Right on!
Already weive begun to do this,
with this little handshake
that we've got,
that they keep trying to copy,
and we keep improving on,
When they go and get their hair
fluffed out, we braid ours,
We're doing our own thing,
We are creating,
Right on!
Right on, brother!
Right on!
We have,
first of all,
got to protect our brothers
and sisters from themselves,
and from those
within the community
that would rip them off,
We have got to do this,
We have got to stop sacrificing
our sisters to the streets
and our brothers to the drugs--
Right on!
We have got to turn that around
and take from them,
I believe in taking,
Go to school and
get that knowledge--
but get it with that
Black awareness always here,
What I'm saying to you...
is that you've got to carry
this "Right On,"
and "Power to the People"
and "Black is Beautiful"
and "Black is Now"
out into your homes,
Talk to your little brothers
and sisters,
Talk to your mothers and fathers,
Talk to the people
that you can relate to
and begin to lift this whole
thing up on a total basis,
Weive got to side up to that sister,
because that sister on...
the street corner is
someone's sister,
That little brother that thinks
it's nice to be high,
weive got to show him
another alternative,
We've got to take care
of our present...
Right on, right on!
We've got to take care
of our future,
Right on, brother!
This is how we begin...
to create a Black America within...
but without white America,
God damn!
God damn!
Hey, man,
this is my brother!
We're gonna get some shit
on together now!
Shit, man, I'm so glad
to see your ass!
Hey, man, hey-- we're ready, man,
We're ready,
It's all here,
You look good,
God, you look good,
Shit--the way
you whipped my ass?
I said, "I'm gonna
get my stuff together,
When this nigger comes back,
he aint gonna jump on me!"
I can still whip your ass
I'm ready for you,
- I just went by to see Mama,
Oh, wow,
Mama aint been able
to understand me since Dad died,
But with you here, we're gonna get
a lot straightened out,
I mean, the shit is together, man,
We're here!
I might as well tell you now,
I might not be able
to tell you later--
Hot damn, John!
I'm gonna get my
stuff together too,
I got some things I wanna do,
All right, hey-- well, shit, it's here.
That's the only way you're gonna
get something done--
do it yourself if you want
to accomplish something,
I'm so glad to see you
I think I'm gonna adopt
that formula for myself,
All right!
This is all right!
This is my brother, man!
How old are you,
Willie?
How old do you think?
Oh, about 40,
- I happen to be 18,
Man, all bitches are the same,
just like my ho's, you know?
I keep 'em, broke,
If they wake up one morning
with some money,
they're subject to go crazy,
I keep 'em looking good,
pretty and all that,
but no dough, And when I get
a bitch, I got a bitch,
Right on,
Remember that
Mack, "The Bear"?
Yeah,
- Tried to steal one of my bitches,
I called him up on the telephone,
I said, "Mack, come
over to the pad,
let's rap a taste on it"
So when he comes over. I told her
to give him a little taste,
'cause she sure as shit
wasn't get in none from me,
See, that nigger wanted the honey,
all we wants is the money,
I was out on the streets driving
checkin' on my game--
I hear you,
I ran into a little old nice thing
you wouldn't believe it,
No shit?
- Aw, she was a beauty,
Oh, man,
You know how
these young macks are,
They dont have their shit in order,
I ran down and copped
this little thing
and knocked her over,
so I went and stashed that away,
Tell me, what are you
gonna do with this one?
Man, shit, You know how I am,
I'm gonna run my thing,
It's all about the money game,
I do mine from Frisco to Maine,
You know how that is,
- You gonna put her on the track?
Most definitely,
Gotta do a little grooming first,
I can do that.
- Then it's cool.
I had a little "shoobie-doobie"
for you last night,
Did you?
I'm sorry I missed that...
I'm gonna be
the meanest mack who ever lived,
They're gonna talk about Goldie
like they used to talk about Jesus!
A-men!
They're gonna have to rewrite
the macking game book,
'cause I'm gonna be the new king!
I'm gonna be
so cold-blooded, baby,
that they're gonna have to change
the name of the game,
And...
I'm gonna get
the hottest bitches I can find,
a whole boatload of money,
then I'm gonna get myself
some fine-looking vines
and a great looking ride,
then I'm just gonna stir it all up.
I'm gonna say, "Come and get it,
Come and get it," I am,
Shit, you dont know
nothing about "Mack",
Everything you need to know,
you got to get from me,
I remember when I first met you,
you know?
You were just a shinyeyed little girl
running around with a snotty nose,
You know what?
You were a funny-looking dude,
with one baggy suit,
and you had the biggest feet
I ever seen in my life!
Feet!
You remember how we used
to run all the way home
from school for lunch
and there was no food there?
Yeah...
I remember,
I remember every bit of that, man,
You know... I even remember
my mama's face
when she used to yell out
the window for me to come in,
My mama was so pretty,
But...
I never went in,
I dont know...
I guess there was nothing
to go in for, you know?
Listen to me
Everybody
While I tell you a story
about "The Mack"
The Mack-- The Mack The Mack
He's gonna show you where it's at
Now Goldie had it together
He had a master plan
He knew what he wanted,
and the only way he could get it
Was cash in the hand,

I dont want to hear you
say that again,
That goes for the rest of you,
if you want to be my partner,
You can be a lawyer, yyou can be
a doctor, yyou can be anything
but I dont ever want to hear
you want to be like me,, okay?
Okay,
Let me give you
some of this money,
'cause I gotta get out of here,
Goldie! Gold--
- Be cool, now! Just be cool, baby,

- You went to school, right?
I was there,

of your cousin, Be careful walking,
Okay, Go ahead,

You hear what I said, Keith?
- All right,
If I catch you missing school,
you dont get no more bread,
I'll be there,
- All right, Later,
Dizzy world,
my mind's in a daze
Plastic smiles
Mixed up,
with phony ways...
What'd you do yesterday, man?
I tried to reach you all day,
I was busy, man,
I told you,
I called your house,
You wasnt home, nigger,
I had to get rid
of a truckload of shit,
I know you tried to call me,
You know what I did?
I dont know,
I know you dont know,
I haven't told you yet,
I went out to the stable,
To white folks, stable?
- Yeah, where Jeff works,
You know that big dude?
That big bad dude?
He put me on a chick whose father
is a corporate lawyer,
Wait a minute,
On the real side?
Yeah, her name is Diane,
Little short white bitch?
With the long hair?
First time I saw her,
my kneecaps got hard,
But I got it together,
- How did you do, nigger?
Well. I made out like
I couldnt ride a horse,
Aw, man, you're cold,
What'd you do?
Been riding
since we were 1 3, right?
And she took off
like the Lone Ranger,
I even took her
out to the restaurant,
I spent a lot of bread on that chick
last night, wrapping her up,
Aw, man, she got some money,
It's going to pay off,
- - And the bitch is fine!
That's okay, when
I finish with her.,
I'll let you have her..
Man, that's beautiful,
'Cause they talking about you,
I heard niggers be doing
"Goldie! Goldie!" Bitches--
Pretty Tony knocked a bitch down...
the other night,
You know Sandra?
Talking about me?
- Yeah, talking about, "Goldie!"
I said, "Who is Goldie?
I dont know who he is,"
The way they was talking...
Something that bothers me--
- What bothers you, nigger?
If you listen,
I'm gonna tell you,
I cant get it in my head how a bitch
can walk the street every night--
even in the rain--
and take a chance...
on getting robbed
or sent to jail,
or even getting her arm broke
by some sadistic fool
out the suburbs, right?
Then she gets all that money,
and gives it to some dude,
I cant figure that shit out,
- The game is strong, baby,
I aint talking about me,
I'm talking about other cats,
You motherfucker,
You're showing some titty, too,
Let me suck that titty,
While I'm thinking
about it, thank you...
for what you did for my mother,
I'm serious about it,
Let's go all the way,
Get some money, man,
Aint no need...
to bullshitThese niggers in love,
Talking about "players,"
They aint no players,
I'm kinda drunk, now,
but I'm cool,
But players take care of business,
I knew you was a player, nigger,
Aint a nigger in the world
got me to shootout but you,
Didn't we? Did we shoot out?
I didn't run,
Know what I mean, baby?
Me and you,
Okay, all right,
We gonna have bitches
from all over the world,
It's gonna be like the Muhammad
Ali--Frazier return bout,
I know! We gonna have
bitches from Ha--wa--ii!
You ever seen a nigger
with a bitch from Ha--wa--ii?
Never!
- It's going to be a monster,
We gonna get down,
- It's gonna be a monster,
Ever since I was 1 3,
my biggest problem has been
to find the right road to get to that...
rainbow that
everybody talks about,
Most people get close enough
to count the stripes,
but they dont have enough guts...
to reach out and take
that pot of gold,
And what are you going to do?
I'm gonna walk off
with the whole pot,
You gonna share that
with anyone?
There's a possibility
I mhight sharee it
with a little lady I just met,
who calls herself Diane,
It's not gonna be
easy though, baby,
It's not gonna be easy,
It's gonna be hard work,
I really have a lot of good feelings,
I know when I first saw you,
I just wanted to touch you,
and hold you,
And there's an incredible
excitement about you,
Youive been very powerful,
I had those good feelings
about you when I first saw you,
So where do we go from here?
We go all the way to the top,
if you're not afraid,
Everything's gonna be all right,
I'm gonna be everything to you,
I'm gonna be your father,
I'm gonna be your friend,
I'm gonna be your lover,
but you gotta believe in me,
You gotta believe
that everything I tell you
to do is for the best,
For the both of us,, okay?
Okay,
Let's have a drink,
Here's...
a toast to what we're getting into,
Trick or treat?
What hole did you
crawl up out of this time, eh?
Whatcha doin' here?
Slumming,
I see you havent changed much,
Still look like a little greaseball,
You know, someday,
I'm going to get the chance
to rearrange that ugly
black face of yours,
Not if I see you first--
you little ugly dwarf,
The Fatman wants
to see you-- now,
Tell the Fatman that
I say go play with himsejf.
He ain't gonna like that,
He's going to get very angry,
You ever thought of having
plastic surgery done to your face?
Youive got five seconds to get
your crummy hand off my coat,
or I'm gonna rip a hole
in that greasy face of yours,
Listen, I may be a greaseball now,
I may still be
a greaseball tomorrow,
but tomorrow,
you'll still be Black!
Stop it!
Diane, your timing is off,
Chico, I want you
to make a sweeping gesture,
get that stuff out of the way,
turn and get the hell out of there,
It's horse and mule time,
Get over to the clothes rack,
Wait a minute!
Bitch, what do you
think you're doing?
Why look behind you
when you should...
look in front of you?
Chico's covering your back,
Chico, walk like
it's a newborn baby,
Get it together!
Let's try it again,
You're on,
Goldie, Sheila came in
this morning broke, man,
Says Pretty Tony busted her ass
and took her money,
Didn't she used to be with Tony?
- He's the one that turned her out,
She's conning you, man,
The bitch is conning you,
Get a sharp knife and tell her
the next time he messes with her
to cut his tongue out
and bring you your money,
Thanks, Goldie,
- - Notice the hooks,
Grab the garment from the inside,
and bring it out,

So he's a friend of yours,
He's my prisoner,
Take your hand off,
That's the way it goes, brother,
Come on, pal,

You ought to learn to relax,
That was downright cold,
The whole thing was foul,

You're on top now, Goldie,
So listen to me,
The word's out you've been
set up for a robbery,
Who is it?
- The gambler,
I'm gonna give you
a break this time...
but next time I hear about you
trying to set me up,
I'm gonna kill your mother,
your two kids,
and that fat, ugly bitch of yours,
then I'm gonna
come looking for you
and blow your heart
out your body, sucker!
Slim-- hey, man!
Hey, man,

No! No! No!
Oh, no! No!
Hold it!
Hey!
Wait for us,

Get your dope-pushing ass
in the car!
Shit!
You all right?
There goes
the best pusher we got,
Out of commission,
When they get through with him,
he'll come back as a monk,
Incredible. Incredible,
Can you imagine that
self-righteous son of a bitch
trying to make
this neighborhood safe
for people to walk around in?
And you mark my words,
he keeps doing that,
we're gonna be broke,
You hear me? We're gonna be
broke and on our asses,
You know something?
My wind was better
before I quit smoking,
I wanna know
where these bitches are,
Nobody's out on the corner,
Where the hell are they?
I gotta straighten
their heads out, you know?
I let a bitch get away
with something last night,
I shouldn't have let her
get away with it,
Put a foot to her ass,
What'd you say?
Put a foot to her ass?
Rght oon, baby
- That's beautiful.
Put a foot to her ass,
That's just what
I'm gonna do, Wow!
He tried to kill me,
Goldie!
He took all my money,
and he made me strip...
- What are you talking about?
Why arent you where
you're supposed to be?
The white trick, Goldie,
He tried to off me, man,
Let me tell you something,
Listen to me closely,
I dont give a shit
about what happened to you,
Now I want you
to get yourself together
get back out there,
and get me my money,
I dont care how long it takes you,
get out there and get it!
Now get!
How you like it, man?
Yeah, it's all right, man,
but it definitely ain't me..
It's not even where my head is,
I'm trying to get away
from shit like this, man,
It's not really that bad, though,
I got about 30,000 tied up in this,
Man, it wasn't like this before,
When we were little,
all you used to talk about,
after our old man died,
was how you were gonna
get Mom a decent place to live in,
How you were gonna
work real hard...
to get her a new pad,
I can buy a house now,
I can buy anything I want,
I'm getting ready to buy her
a place right now,
These are my people out here,
I got a whole thing out here,
I'm controlling. I got a lot of things
I'm manipulating..
I got a nice life, man,
These people out here
on the streets...
are your people, huh?
Here I am, your own brother,
trying to clean up the streets,
You're telling me people
on the streets are "your people"?
Hey, look here,
You know what I'm doing?
I got a little show
I call the "Planetarium Show,"
I got a thing
that I do with my women,
I put on a show for iem and I talk,
I want you to come
and check it out for me, okay?
You've got to be living!
No. I'm serious,
It's really fun, man,
I really got those bitches minds
controlled, bro',
I'm laughing,
but it an't funny,.
You are all here
because you have
successfully passed
one of the requirements
to become a member
of Goldie's illustrious family,
This family is like
a large corporation
filled with qualified stockholders,
or if you prefer,
"gifted actresses,"
But I'd rather call you
"Professional Ladies of Leisure,"
each playing a major role
in this large production company,
for the whole world is our stage,
In this organization
there is a president,
a director,
and a teacher,
All of these offices are held by me,
In this family,
there is no room for confusion,
Anyone or anything
opposing my will,
must be, and will be...
destroyed!
Now these are
my rules and regulations,
I want you to repeat after me--
"l will not lie."
"l will not lie."
"l will not steal."
"l will not steal."
"l will not cheat."
"l will not cheat."
"l will confide in
and respect Goldie,"
"l will confide in
and respect Goldie,"
"I will remain a lady at all times."
"I will remain a lady at all times."
"And I accept this
as a lifetime contract,"
"And I accept this
as a lifetime contract,"
Should you fulfill
all of your obligations to me,
the rewards... the riches
will be great,
You will have protection,
You'll have your
own bank account,
You'll own your own real estate,
All of this can be yours,
All of this...
and if you really do things
correctly and follow my orders,
I'll even take you with me
to the Playersi Picnic,
and to the upcoming Playersi Ball,
I want you to go home now,
and get sleep,
and make yourselves beautiful,
and go do your work,
You sure are looking good,
Where you been keeping yourself?

- I sure am glad to hear that,
I'm gonna have to check

Yeah, much later,
Today is a holiday,
Aint nobody getting laid today,
Nobody?
- - Uh--uh!

Ahh!
Crippled children, baby,
For the crippled children,
Here it comes,
Get ready out there,
All right, Goldie,
Chuck it to me, We got this boy,
How in the hell can you
drop a ball like that?
Playing with young girls all night.
That helps.
You got a cunt collar so big
you couldnt hit the ball,
Hey, lob him one,
Goldie!
God damn! How all expect me
to catch with a hard-on?

no goddamn cup!
What you want, man?
- Whiskey,

Shit, man! I had him
right in my back pocket,
That was damn good, man,
Reach down your pocket
and pull him out for us, huh?
I'm no goddamned magician,
Then fake it.
That's bullshit,
You cant do nothing to me,
Come here, will you?
Come on. I want
to tell you something,
A little closer,
You listen to me,
Next time you're asked
a question, yyou answer it,
or I'll hang your black ass
in space, You understand?
Then I'll kick your
goddamned teeth...
so far down your throat
it'll take a dredging crew
a week to get iem out,
Now is that clear?
Yeah, man,
That's 'cause you're a good boy,
You are a good boy,
Clean up your bar,
It stinks,
Here I am,
working my ass off,
and he's spending my money
on some trashy white bitch!
You better be quiet,
Otherwise, you go out!
You want to be nice?
Okay, what is it now?
You know, you're really
something, Goldie,
You sit in that nice restaurant
feed your face and sit with
that nice white pretty lady,
My buddy and I are out here
freezing our asses off,
to protect people like you,
and that's really something,
Let's talk some heavy shit, huh?
What's inhitt fo u,
hmm? I mheanh, us.
You know what your problem is?
- - Tell us,
You wanna be me,
You'd like to have my clothes,
you'd like to take my money
and get in my big car,
You'd like to have some
of those pretty women I got--
especially that pretty white one
that I left in the restaurant,
I bet you have a problem
with women, dont you?
And in fact...
you'd even like to look like me,
You or me?
You,
Yeah!
Resisting arrest again, huh?
Happens all the time,
I dont understand these guys,
- Just cant adjust, can you?
Hold your hands there, Goldie,
Everything will be all right,
Dont get cute, sweetheart,
Just relax,
These bastards are
always resisting,
All right, jungle bunny,
You okay, sweetheart?
You all right?
You all right, Goldie?
- You okay? Let's go home,
Okay, what's your name?
Jesus Christ,
Jesus...
Address?
- - Jerusalem,
Jerusalem,
And your occupation?
Carpenter,
- Carpenter,
All right, what can we do for you?
Welll...
to begin with...
how about a quarter
for a cup of coffee?
You know. I used to think
you were smart,
I thought you had the brights,
But it turns out you're nothing
but another street punk,
What you trying tose, huh?
- I'm sellling you survival.
You play ball with me,
everything will be all right,
But keep going the way you are,
keep fucking up...
I'm going to save
a spot for you in the morgue,
Are you threatening me, man?
- Me? Threaten you, Goldie?
No, I'm making
a suggestion, that's all,
It's part of the community
relations program--
you know, get to know
your neighborhood better,
"Take a Nigger to Lunch Week,"
you know, things like that,
Listen to me,
We can work together,
I can help you,
I dont want to be on that side,
I want to be on your side,
You dig?
- I can dig it, man,
Hey look, I'm tired
of talking to you,, okay?
Is that it, Goldie?
- That's it, man.
How long has it been,
Goldie?
It's been a long time!
You don't want that,
do you?
I remember when you used
to love that stuff,
Turn him loose.
Get away!
What do you want, Goldie?
Tell me,
You can have anything
you want, okay?
You name it and I'll give it to you,
And do you know why?
Because you're my golden boy,
I'm not your boy, Why did you have
these idiots snatch me up here?
I sent you invitations.
live been busy, man!
- - So have l,
Okay, I'm here!
Tell me what it is,
Goldie, first of all
I wanted to see you,
Okay, you're looking at me!
We had some awfully good times
together, Goldie,
I remember those times, Fats,
I remember too well, man,
You lived awfully well, baby,
I paid though, man,
I paid so much,
Ah...
But I dont pay no more,
I'm living in a different world,
Yeah?
Outside,
That's what I want to talk
to you about, Goldie--
your future world,
Come here,
Goldie...
I want you to come back
to work for me, Goldie,
I want you to come back
to work for me,
It'll be like old times,
Better than old times,, okay?
Now wait a minute,
You realize something
Goldie, that...
you were the only person
that I could trust
in that whole ghetto?
I mean, yyou always
stood up straight,
You did what you were told,
and I never forgot that,
I'm giving you a chance
to win it all, baby--
I'm not intersted,
Fats!
What, are you going
to go on playing "Fagan"?
What do you got? A ragtag bunch
of pretty little girls,
Look, that "ragtag bunch
of pretty young girls"
brings me in at least 3,000 a week,
Chicken feed,
It may be chicken feed to you,
but it's not chicken feed to me!
It's a million miles
from where I came from,
A, million miles
from the cold cuts,
and that filth, and that dirt,
and all that otherfuckup!
3,000 was a lot to me then,
and it's still a lot,
I 'm not asking you, Goldie,
I 'm telling you,
I've invited you in,
and you're coming in,
Look at this arm,
Do you remember this arm?
I remember it!
Remember all the shit
that went in it, man?
Goldie,
you're getting too big!
Do you remember all that shit
that went into my arm?
Yeah!
- Well then, look at it!
I'm looking at it. I told you
before, you're too big,
You're getting too big,
The word has come down,
It's not healthy to get too big!
You're going to go to work for me,
and the first thing
you're going to do...
is go back on the street,
You're going to tell that brother
of yours to cool off,
and I want no more
attempts to throw...
our people off the streets,
Now go home,
Dont touch me!
Dont touch me,
You really dont
understand, do you?
Dont you realize in order for us
to make this thing work,
weive got to get rid of the pimps,
the pushers, and the prostitutes,
and then start
all over again, clean?
Hey, look, nobody's
pushing me anywhere,
Not you, not the cops,
nobody, man!
You want to get rid
of the pushers, I'll help you,
but dont send
your people after me,
Oh, come on, John,
Cant you see, we cant get rid
of one without the other?
We got to come down
on both of 'em at the same time
in order for this
to work for the people,
Hey look, nobody's
closing me out of my business,
Hey, man, yyou're
my flesh and blood,
You're making me make a decision
I dont want to make, John,
You're my brother, man,
cant you understand that?
Look--being brothers
aint got nothing to do with it,
I got a right to live my life
the way I want to live it,
Being rich and Black means
something, dont you know that?
Being poor and Black
dont mean shit!
We're living in different times,
When you and I were young kids,
there were no heroes,
We got all sorts of heroes now,
There are kids out there
who look up to me, man,
Cant you see that's just
teaching Black kids
to exploit their own kind?
And that's sick,
It's not sick! It's sick
when you got a chance
to get out of a rat-infested
ghetto and you don't,
Wow, you've lost your love for...
the brothers altogether,
haven't you?
Dont be dropping that
"brotherly love" shit on me, man!
For five years I sat up in that place,
you never visited me!
You didnt bring me a dime,
You didnt write me a letter,
I figured you wanted
something better
than dimes and letters and visits,
I tried to create
some kind of organization
you could use to fight the system
that's been fucking with you,
You too goddamned
brainwashed to use it!
I just wanted to see you, man,
That's all,
I like women of substance--big...
m-meaty...
you know?
Listen, every--
everybody wants
to be skinny today,
But you see,
that's not real,
You know what's real?
That's real,
right there
That's what's real,
Look at that,
That's real.
That's something
a man can hold on to,
I mean...
small tits and bony asses...
Little necks and skinny legs!
Christ--no way,
That's not truth.
You wanna know
what truth is? Hmm?
I'll tell you what truth is.
Truth is...
pimples,
and garlic,
armpits.
That's what truth is.
There's a- there's an animal
in the jungle
who has--
four small legs--
skinny, skinny--
and he has a long skinny neck,
What the hell
do you call it, anyway?
Oh--it's a giraffe,
Yeah,
Yeah, it's a giraffe,
Now, a giraffe is skinny, you see?
And that sucker
can sneak up on you,
You never trust anybody
with skinny legs
or a skinny ass,
You just dont do it,
You know what you can trust?
You can trust an elephant,
You know why?
iCause an elephant has big legs,
and they cant sneak up
on you like a giraffe can,
And that's why I like elephants,
You know?
Come on in,
Hank...
you are slippini, baby,
Now, that was a giraffe,
It's the one right there
on the first floor,
You can move in
any time you get ready,
For me?
- Yeah, for you,
Really, Goldie?
- It's yours, Mom,
I've always wanted a nice place,
I just can't belivee it.
Wait till you see inside,
Now I can do some of the things
live always wanted to,
I can invite my friends over,
have a nice dinner,
I have two fine sons
that are always
giving me nice gifts,
I'm a very lucky woman,
We're lucky sons,
Well, as I live and breathe,
it's Sergeant Duncan,
So it is,
You know, he's a white knight--
no, he's a Black knight--
on a white horse,
Right,
You know what I got
on my "white horse"?
Evidence,
Names...
dates...
photographs,
and witnesses,
You been a busy boy,
I've got all I need on you two...
jive-ass cops,
Jesus H, Christ!
I really dont understand you,
Here you are,
a police officer--
I mean, you should be
doing your duty,
At this moment, there are women
being raped in this city,
children being molested,
stores being held up,
drunks staggering around
into innocent old ladies,
You're playing "Sherlock Holmes"
and screwing around with us
because of some...
misunderstanding?
Let's get a cup of coffee,
all right? This is ridiculous,
You know what you're gonna get?
You're gonna get 24 hours,
24 hours to get out
of this precinct,
Now, you gotta be punished
because of that,
Police! You, you, and you,
up against the wall,
Move!
Come on, move!
All I want to see is assholes
and elbows, Come on, boy,
Move!
Put your hands up,
Goldie,
Put 'em up,
you son of a bitch!
Up!
What the fuck is this?
I got too much money for this shit,
I thought you paid
these poop-butts off,
Now, spread 'em,
- Hey--I'm a rich nigger,
I got lawyers,
you beat-walkini motherfucker,
Oof!
Come on, come on,
Spread 'em out!
Now, a Black cop has been killed,
Goldie, I think you
and that freak did it,
Outside-- now!
Move!
Come on!
- - Now, move it!
Looks like somebody
broke your door,
Get it fixed,
Go on home,
Goldie,
Just walk down the street,
and go on home,
Go on home, baby,
Come on-- walk down the street
and go on home,
Go on,
- Come on, nigger, run,
I an't runnin' noplace.
- Just run down thee street.
Kill me here,
You wanna kill me, motherfucker?
Then off me-- kill me,
you know what I mean?
I ain't runnin'
no motherfuckin' place.
I aint no track star,
I'm gonna get your ass, Hank,
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch
Kill me, motherfucker!
- I'll blow your fuckini head off!
I'll kill you,
you Black bastard!
Both you fuckers are gonna get it!
You motherfuckini punk!
He's a punk, Goldie,
We're gonna get the motherfucker,
'cause he's a punk!
You ain't shit!
I'm gonna get him, Goldie!
Goldie, we gonna get iem,
'cause they pulled down on us,
They didn't use thatshit, baby!
The motherfucker
pulled a gun on me, man!
I ain't bullshittin',
brother!
We gonna get iem!
Punk--ass motherfucker!
As he's going down the road,
he looked back
at his old hometown,
He didnt know where he was going
he didn't know what he was doing
but he was going
to a world of trouble,
A world of misunderstanding
a world of doubt,
A world of whores,
a world of hypocrites!
A world of gamblers,
a world of dope smokers!
A world of prostitutes!
He was going into a mean world,
but he didnt know
where he was going,
You understand me?
He didn't know
where he was going,
He was going to a world
that was gonna destroy him,
but he didnt know
where he was going,
You know, so many of us today
are doing things to ourselves,
because we dont know
what we're doing!
You understand me?
If we just stop and think
about ourselves sometimes,
everything would be all right,
You understand me?
We're gonna jump off
the Bay Bridge...
worried about this man,
worried about that man,
because we dont
know who we are,
we dont know where we're going
and we dont know
what we was here for!
You understand me?
Good God Almighty,
Look at this boy
with his big money,
He's on the crap table now,
shooting his dice,
He aint got sense enough to know
his money aint gonna last
doing these wrong things,
doing these worldly things--
gambling and drinking--
it's a end to these things,
One of these days,
one of these hours,
it's gonna run out,
But one of these days,
you're gonna have to make up
your mind to change your ways,
I can see this young man--
oh, good God,
I can see this young man
as he made up in his mind
to start back home,
He money ran out, his friends
walked off and left him,
His buddies walked off
and left him,
his girlfriends quit him,
He lost all he had,
He had dirt all on his clothes,
his hair got bad,
He said, "Look at me,
just look at me,
Here I am, a young man,
had a good home,
had a good father
and had a good mother,
but here I am--
turned the rags to riches
out here in the mean world,
I dont know where I'm going
or where I'm coming,
I believe I'll go back home,"
When they got you crying...
We got to go home!
Oh-hh--
Church today!
Get ready!

Goldie, get off my ass...
with the penny-ante
pussy schemes,
I come down
and talk to you personally,
and all you can do
is embarrass me,
You think I'm suddenly less
because you got big ideas?
Is that what you think?
I'm more, Goldie,
I'm much more,
Listen, do you think...
that I want to hear
about somebody
muscling you,, or coming down
on a contract on you?
I dont believe you, man,
I dont believe you!
Goldie. I cant protect you forever,
I mean, after all of these years...
after all these years I realize
why they call you "Fatman"--
It's not just because
of your fat stomach,
or because your pockets
are fat with money--
it's because of your fat head,
Just do me a favor.
Iive been having...
a good time all night,
Leave me alone,
will ya?
I've had enough out of you,
I'm not gonna take any more shit
from you, Goldie,
When I tell you to shit,
squat, grunt, and ask what color,
The people with the funny hats
and the noisemakers,
they've gone home,
The party's over, baby,
It's dawn.
It's reality.
You... you're a pig,
You're a greedy,
greedy pig,
You're proud of it, too,
arent you?
You're just really proud--
"Yeah, yyeah, yyeah!"
You won't be satisfied
until every 10-month-old kid
has a needle stuck in his arm,
you know that?
You're worse than cancer,
You're like an epidemic,
You're a disease, man!
You're like a curse,
Let me tell you something Fatman,
Let me tell you something
you vicious-ass piece of jelly!
I'm gonna drive you off the streets,
I'm gonna drive you back...

Do me a favor-- take old

All right with me,
Hey, man,
there's China Doll,
Hey baby,
- Hey, how you do?
Remember me?
I'd have to lose
all the brain cells in my head
before I forget something
as fine as you,
Does everyone need
an audition to get with you?
You ain't gotta go
through all that shit,
Then I choose you,
Be cool, baby,
okay?
Hey, bitch, come here!
You out of your motherfucking
mind? Come here!
Mr, Pretty Tony, yyou know
the rules of the game,
Your bitch just chose me,
We can settle this
like you got some class,
or we can get into
some gangster shit,
You shade-tree nigger,
You aint no pimp,
You're a rest haven for ho's,
You're a car thief!
A car thief!
That one you got is probably
hot as a firecracker right now!
That was 35,000?
- 35,000 cash money,
35,000 plus one, right?
- The one I gave you?
No, you gave me six,
I had one,
35,000--plus one
plus six makes seven--
35,000 and seven, right?
Motherfucker, can you buy that?
Nigger, next time you hear
grown folks talking
shut the fuck up, hear?
Go get her, Bob,
Bring the bitch here,
Freeze, nigger,
You wanna die?
This the way it's gonna be, man?
- It's your play,
I'm gonna make you wish
you never was born, nigger,
Let's get out of this dump,
Who is it?
A friend of Goldie's,
- - Just a minute,
Yes?
Mama...
Hi, Mama,
I... knew you would come,
Yeah,
The...
the doctor said...
He said you were
gonna be all right,
He's a good doctor,
Mama...?
Mama?
Mama?
Come on,
I aint got all night,
This all you got?
- That's all I could turn.
Four goddamn hours,
and that's all you got?
I tried,
- - Come here, motherfucker,
You okay, Slim?
You okay?
- Nigger just got me on the skin,
You stuck my man, Tony,
Okay,
now, stick yourself,
Come on-- come on, Goldie--
Stick yourself!
Stick yourself!
Come on, baby--
- Stick yourself!
Stick yourself, Tony!
All right,
you got 10,
Come on, man!
- - Stick it!
One--
Two--
- - Come on, man, Come on!
Ahh-hh!
Stick yourself again!
Argh!
Stick it again!
Come on, baby,
- Stick yourself!
Stick yourself, nigger!
- Eight, nine... 10...
Ow!
One more for me, now, huh?
'Cause Goldie's mad,
Do it again, Tony!
- Don't get him mad!
Goldie, please, Stick yourself,
We're trying to help you!
Stick it again, Tony!
Argh-hh!
Didnt I tell you,
my man was righteous?
Do it again, Tony!
- - Come on, man!
One for me, baby,
Don't get angry--
Nine...
- - Be cool,
My mama was the most righteous
woman who ever lived, Tony,
You shouldnt have hurt her,
She brought me
into this world, Tony,
You know, it's stuff like this
that raises our insurance rates?
The little guy always pays, right?
You bet your ass,
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mama,
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, Olinga,
I'm really sorry, man,
You brought death
to our house, man,
Following you,
it caught up with our mother,
I'm gonna follow you
until you lead me to it...
then I'm gonna klll it.
You wont have to look for me,
Don't even look
over your shoulder,
'cause I'll be there,
You believe that,
Goldie... somebody
dropped a dime,
They got a contract out on you,
Who is it?
There's two on the fire escape,
and there's three or four
in a car downstairs,
None of it makes sense, man,
None of it,
We're gonna beat iem,
Goldie,
Come on,
we're gonna beat 'em,
Change,
I'll meet you there, Slim,
Be careful,
You guessed it,
pimp,
We killed him,
Want to know something else?
I killed your mama,
I'd like to do it again,
I almost forgot that,
We killed your mama, too,
Hank--!
Get down,
Goldie...
I'm you,
and you're me,
I mean...
you would have done
the same thing,
The same thing, man,
The same thing,
The same things!
Brother's gonna work it out
Brother's gonna work it out
Brother's gonna work it out
Brother's gonna work it out
Now dont give him no peace sign
If you dont mean it from your heart
United,
we can get over
Yet we're still apart
'Cause each man demands respect
And to get his equal share
And untill you're giving him that
There'll be no peace
Brother's gonna work it out
Brother's gonna work it out
Let's all join hands,
we can march across this land
In peace
Love, joined
with an understanding
Of truly who we are
Instead of brother turning on sister
Sister turning on brother
Now how you gonna get it together
being against one another?
Shoot up, stick up, so high
till your world has turned to stone
How can you deal with the truth
When reality's all gone?
But brother's gonna work it out...
Brother's gonna work it out.
