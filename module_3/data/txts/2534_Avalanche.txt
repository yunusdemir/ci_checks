For we meet in an hour
of change and challenge,
in a decade of hope and fear,
in an age of both
knowledge and ignorance.
The greater our knowledge increases,
the greater our ignorance unfolds.
So it is not surprising
that some would have us
stay where we are a little longer.
To rest, to wait.
But this city of Houston,
this state of Texas,
this country of the United States
was not built by those who waited and
rested and wished to look behind them.
We choose to go to the Moon.
We choose
to go to the Moon--
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade and do the other things,
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.
[Matt Johnson]
With this one speech,
John F. Kennedy escalated our Cold War
with the Soviet Union to outer space.
Now, if we do not land a man
on the Moon by 1969,
we will have broken JFK's promise.
And in the eyes of the world,
the Soviet Union will win the Cold War.
To make matters even more difficult,
the CIA has discovered a leak
coming out of the space program.
Top secret American research
is showing up in Soviet briefings,
which means the KGB has implanted
a mole inside NASA.
If the Russians are able
to steal our technology,
they could beat us to the Moon,
just as they beat us into space
with the Sputnik satellite in 1957.
The director of NASA, James Webb,
denies the presence of this mole,
which means the CIA must move
in a team undercover.
That's where we come in.
Allow me to introduce
Owen Williams,
and myself, Matt Johnson.
We joined the CIA through
the Bright Recruits program
and have been working together
ever since.
Along with our camera team,
we make up the CIA's AV Department.
Currently, we are finishing
Operation Deep Red:
The probe into film director
Stanley Kubrick.
But this mission is not using us
to our full potential.
We are asking to be transferred off
of Operation Deep Red,
and on to Operation Zipper:
The mission into NASA
to find the mole.
Because of our filmmaking
background, we would make...
[Boles] Okay, stop.
- [film reel stopping]
- Stop.
What is this
supposed to be?
Okay. It's a-- It's a pitch film.
It-- So-- It's for Operation Zipper.
I think--
Operation Zipper's already
been assigned.
We know it has.
I think the agency is making a mistake
with sending a scientist into NASA.
Well, your opinion means nothing.
Yeah, okay. Just-- just--
If you watch the rest of this film,
- you'll see...
- I've seen enough.
But we have an amazing plan
for finding the spy.
I'm sure you do.
Boles, we worked hard on this. You're
seriously not going to watch the rest?
- No.
- Can we show it to Brackett?
No.
- [door closes]
- Okay.
This was a long shot.
We've only been here
for one year.
We'll get on missions
like this in the future.
I thought this was
going to work.
You knew...
You knew that it wasn't a great chance.
Yeah, you should--
Jared, you should have cut
when you saw it wasn't going good.
You're supposed to be
filming so that...
[Jared]
I didn't even notice.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
Cut.
Okay, I got an idea.
We need to send someone who will look
like they have no idea what's going on.
Us, as a documentary film crew.
- We can pretend that
- Okay.
- we are from the National Education...
- We have to go.
We got to go.
Is this a good idea?
- Andy?
- It's a good-- Hey. It's a good idea.
- Are you ready?
- What if they fire us?
What's your first line?
Oh, uh... "your plan is to send--"
Okay, I'm fine.
- Okay. Let's go.
- [both chuckling]
[Brackett] Everyone here?
Boles.
- Carry on.
- Thank you.
Good morning, everyone.
- [reel rolling]
- [music playing]
[indistinct talking]
Hello, my name
is Special Agent Matt Johnson,
and what you're about to watch is a film
detailing the connections
between Stanley Kubrick
and the film Dr. Strangelove
or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love the Bomb.
Conclusion:
Stanley Kubrick is not a spy.
[sighs]
- Thank you.
- [reel stops]
Are there any questions?
[distant coughing]
That covers it.
Uh, what's next?
[Matt] Actually, Director Brackett,
I'd like to make a pitch
for major research to be moved
onto Operation Zipper next.
[Boles] What the hell
are you doing?
You guys are trying to put
a... field agent inside NASA
posing as a scientist,
and... Agent Williams and I
don't think it will work.
This mole, if he's there,
could have been at NASA
since the early '60s.
He's going to spot one of our guys
pretending to be
a rocket scientist instantly.
We need to send people
who are going to look like
they have no idea what's going on.
Us, as a documentary film crew.
We can pretend that we're from the
National Education Television Network,
filming the definitive
Apollo documentary.
We're there to chart the race
to the Moon.
Smart idea.
But no Soviet mole's gonna let anyone
openly film 'em.
Well, Director Brackett, we're filming you
right now through the window.
[murmuring]
You're going to have to buy us
better cameras, though.

Whoa!
- Hi!
- [Sharon] Hi!
- Just let us get our stuff.
- Yeah, yeah!
You need help, Andy?
Do you mind
if we film this?
[Sharon chuckles]
Yeah, why not?
Here, at the end
of the hall on the right...
Oh, man.
That's Mission Control?
- [Sharon] Yeah, actually.
- We'll have to get in there later.
Hmm.
Hi. We're a documentary
film crew.
We're a documentary
film crew.
Jared, make sure you're
getting this crisp and in focus.
I don't want to have to edit together
out of focus stuff, please. Sorry.
[Sharon] No problem.
Your office is just right here.
Okay, here you go.
[Matt] Wow!
[Sharon] You guys don't need
anything else?
[Matt] No, uh, we'll come find you
if we do. We'll just get set up.
- Thanks, Sharon.
- [Matt] Bye!
She bought it.
We're a documentary film crew.
You see how they look at us?
See how they look in the cameras?
Yeah.
[chuckles] This is the best mission
I've ever been on in my life.
[Sharon] This is, uh...
This is Matt.
- Mike.
- Nice to meet you.
[Sharon]
And, uh, this is Jared.
They're filming a documentary
about the, uh... the Apollo mission.
Oh, okay!
So, we basically-- we just are asking
- about what you do, and...
- Sure!
- And-- and I'm ready.
- Yeah. Okay.
Well, I work here
in the Public Affairs office,
and one of my duties is
the media products,
specifically still photos.
He was making, uh, meatballs.
And he's got his hand and he's rolling
them on the plate like that.
And I stood up in the theater
in Sugar Land and I said,
"Don't eat those meatballs!
He did not wash his hands."
- [chuckling]
- [Mike] I had to--
- I appreciate your time.
- Before we launch to the Moon,
- come back and see us, okay? Okay.
- I will.
Thanks, guys. That's a wrap.
We got it.
[Jared chuckles]
All right, and mark it.
[Owen]
Milt interview. Take one.
[sniffs]
[Andy] Thanks, Owen.
[Matt] So, I guess you can start
just by telling us your name.
Milt Heflin.
[Matt] And what is it you do
here at NASA?
Huh. Uh...
[door creaking]
[Matt whispering]
Okay.
Shut the door.
Guys, can we get a shot
of just the lounge being busy?
I know-- I know you're all working,
but if you want to just...
Busy, like there's
some activity.
- Or-- or just do whatever feels natural.
- [chuckling]
[Matt] And action.
No, don't look at the cameras.
Just ke--- just keep sitting.
Just keep standing there.
[indistinct conversations]
[woman] I said I'd be closer
to Jesus. Okay?

US offers...
...spread over 600 feet to become
a gigantic pool of flames.
...a fire extinguisher called Purple K,
three tragic fires aboard aircraft...
[Matt on reel] One second, Mr. Webb.
We're good?
Mr. Webb, tell me,
what does it mean
when people say the Russians
are ahead of us in the space race?
Well, I think it means that the job
of landing something on the Moon
where there's no atmosphere,
and using a rocket to slow it up,
and having the equipment still work
is a very difficult job.
Uh, I think it means the Russians
are trying, just like we are.
- And each of us...
- Where's this guy's office?
...but I think the real meaning
is... is very--
[Matt whispering]
Two more pieces.
- [Owen] Come on, Jared.
- [Matt] Got it, got it!
Okay, hold on.
I'm fine, I need light.
Ready?
Test, test, test, test...
[Webb on recording] ...then you get
to talk about how to go forward to do it.
Uh, I am not
much interested,
and I don't think it's very realistic
to talk about technological interchange,
and this kind of thing.
You first gotta get on the basis
- where-- where--
- [shuts off recording]
Okay, so...
His phone rings in his office,
and this phone rings
at the same time.
As long as we're rolling
when he picks up, we get everything.
[Owen on phone] I found us a house.
It's beautiful, it's red,
it has a nursery and a yard.
You'll love it.
[Julie on phone]
How big is the bed?
It's a queen.
[distant music playing]
Are you alone right now?
No, I'm at work.
What are you doing?
Do you want to know
what I'm wearing?
Julie, I can't do this right now.
I'm at the office.
I'm sorry, maybe later.
Well, I'm wearing a pink bra
and that black skirt you bought me.
Honey, Matt is right beside me and I'm
at work, okay? Can I call you tonight?
I'm taking off the skirt now.
[Julie gasps]
- There's nothing underneath.
- Whoa!
[chuckles]
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
I'm trying to have fun with you.
- Wait a second, hold on...
- No!
[Julie] What is it?
[Matt] We're not doing anything.
I'm doing work.
Hello?
Don't do that.
What'd you find in that phone?
- What? What? Oh, my God.
- Owen...
- [white noise]
- We've been bugged.
We've been bugged, guys.
We've been bugged.
No, no, no!
Anything else,
or is that it? Owen?
That's it from this car?
Guys?
I said I was sorry!
Your hat?
[Owen] A couple more boxes here.
These are not a big deal.
Please don't touch me.
I'll get the rest!
[jazz music playing on radio]
[engine stops]
[Webb on recording] We both, uh,
have had and will have emergencies,
and, uh, that each flight,

[music stops]
- ...setting us back four years...
- [man] Well...
Uh...
[man on recording]...300 second burn
to the lunar surface...
- This is nothing.
- Give it a second.
- [Webb] 250 seconds is all we can do?
- [man] That's the maximum.
- And you know that...
- [Webb] Did you talk to TRW?
- [Owen] Who's the other voice?
- [Matt] I don't know.
[man]...about their fuels.
So we're in trouble.
[Webb]
Grumman has fucked us.
They built a lander
that can't land.
So, we are going back
for another prototype...
With whom?
This is setting us back four years.
Well, I agree. This is going
to have to change.
Change? We can't land
on the Moon.
Unless by some miracle
Braun finds lighter fuel,
- we aren't touching down for five years.
- Okay...
We're just going to be circling
forever up there.
So what are we telling everyone?
- Nothing. We don't tell anyone--
- [recording stops]
[sighs]
[Matt] Do you understand
what this means?
NASA can't do it.
They can't land man
and come back.
Have you called Brackett?
Of course not!
I needed to tell you guys first.
We need to tell Brackett.
We need to tell Brackett right away.
This is something you report right away.
We need help.
- We have to...
- Relax, it's okay. Yes. Yes.
- And we need...
- I'll tell you what to do, okay?
I'm gonna tell you what to do.
Find out who that other guy
on that phone was, okay?
Because, if we found this out
in a month,
you better fucking believe that the mole
can do the same thing.
And now all of a sudden the Russians
know we can't make it to the Moon,
then what the fuck are
we going to do?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You call Langley.
It's ringing.
[line ringing]
You think I'll get to talk
to the President? No.
That's not unrealistic.
I could.
He could be like, "We need to get this
right to the President."
I'll be like, "All right. Give me
his home phone, sir. I'll..." [laughs]
- [all laughing]
- [line continues ringing]
[Brackett on phone]
Hello?
Director Brackett, it's Agent Johnson
calling from Houston.
We have big news.
What's that?
They can't make it to the Moon.
We intercepted a call
from Jim Webb.
From what I understand,
they can circle the Moon,
but they can't actually land.
They-- they don't have
the technology to do it.
They're saying 1971
at the earliest.
[Brackett sighs]
Damn it. Give me a minute.
Okay, who else
knows about this?
Uh, nobody, from-- from--
from what we can tell.
They're talking about it on the phone
like it was a big secret,
like they've never talked about it before.
Okay, good.
Another unit is going
to take over Zipper.
Get your team out of there.
Uh... You think maybe that's a bit, uh,
shortsighted in a way,
seeing as we're here undercover now?
What-- Why?
Don't question my orders, kid.
I'm not-- I don't mean
to question it. I--
I just-- I simply think
that we're here
and I-- We have to figure out
a response to this,
- somehow, and you've got us...
- [line disconnects]
[dial tone]
We're going home.
[sighs]
[sighs]
♪♪
[music continues]
[Matt] If either of us are talking, shoot.
I don't care how much film you burn,
it doesn't matter.
Okay? It's going to save us.
[Owen] What are we
doing in here?
Sit down, just listen
to this, okay?
Well...
- Hold on a sec...
- Did you call Brackett last night?
- Yes, all right?
- What did he say?
Okay, turn this on.
What did they say?
I'm gonna tell you
what they said.
- [Owen] Okay, it's on.
- [beeping]
Okay, you hear that?
- Yeah.
- [beeping continues]
- You recognize it?
- Yeah.
It's Sputnik.
[stammers] You know what?
You're ahead of me.
Okay, yeah.
It's Sputnik.
How do you know
it's Sputnik?
Can you... Did you
sleep here last night?
[Matt] That's not plugged
into anything.
It's-- it's just a dial on the other side.
It's not actually Sputnik.
It's just making you think that it is.
It's just a random beeping.
And because you think
that that's supposed to be Sputnik,
that's why you believe
it's Sputnik.
This is what we are
going to do with the Moon.
I called Brackett,
told him that they
can't make it for '69.
He said, "Okay, well,
you've got to figure out a way to fix it."
And I said, "We can do it on our own.
"We can make a film that shows us
going to the Moon
without actually doing it."
We know that
they can make it up there.
We're not-- We're faking
the last little piece.
The tiny-- The tiny thing they can't do:
Land and come back.
The thing JFK said we'd do.
That's the only part.
Everything else is real,
do you understand?
Yeah, I understand what you're saying
and I understand that it sounds like--
Read this,
it's from Brackett.
- He sent a briefing?
- Yes.
If we can pull this off,
we are going to look
like geniuses.
Four guys inside of NASA figure out
[whispering] how to make it look
like we went to the Moon. We did it.
That's crazy!
This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.
It literally fell on our lap.
We could run our own department
after something like this.
♪♪
[Owen] Is there
more information coming?
[Matt] About what?
Well, the objectives
and the budget.
Why?
This doesn't seem
incomplete to you?
Incomplete? How?
What do you mean?
Well, I-- Okay...
You know what? Don't--
don't worry about this.
They obviously told us exactly
what they want us to hear,
so our job is to film a test,
and that's it.
Come on.
[Owen] Does it-- You don't have
an ethical problem with this at all?
In what way?
In that this is lying.
You know what? This is like one
of those good lies,
like Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.
[straining] A lot of kids get really
mad about those.
[grunts]
[both laugh]
So we're shooting this
at 48 frames a second,
so you're going to have to move like...
like you're being lifted up.
- Okay? Like this...
- This thing weighs about 100 pounds.
Well, just try it.
Try leaping a bit.
Like this.
Yeah, good.
Go! Action! Action!
[Jared] More that way.
[Matt]
More towards me a bit.
[Jared]
Walk off that way.
[Matt] Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Stop.
[panting]
We should be doing this at night.
Can-- can the light
move a little bit to the left?
[Owen] I'm being devoured
and I'm cookin'.
No, that's too far.
That's too far.
Back over this way.
Back to your right.
- It doesn't matter...
- Stop! Stop!
Okay, now a bit
to your left.
How much does
the light drop off?
Are you not getting
destroyed by mosquitoes?
Okay, I am, but I'm trying
to get this right. Hold on.
What else is in the frame?
[Jared] Uh, I see some logs
in the background.
Yeah, I see it, too.
Okay, I'm getting it.
[Owen]
That's what you're...
Please, let's just roll.
It is fine, it's fine.
[Matt] It's not a log,
it's a rock!
[Jared] It's okay,
we'll frame it out.
- I'm going to use it!
- Okay!
I'm going to put it in the frame.
Are you ready?
And action!
Owen, jump in the air.
Holy shit.
[banging on door]
It's open!
- Hey.
- You're just in time. Have a seat.
So the Moon footage,
I won't say how it looks.
I just want you to watch it, okay?
Turn the lights off. Turn the lights off.
[film rolling]
So it may seem
a bit different.
I think you'll enjoy it.
[music playing on film]
[both laughing]
[Matt] This is the year
before we got recruited.
[Owen] Wow.
[both snickering]
[banging on door]
[film stops]
[Matt] Who is it?
Hello?
Director Brackett,
this is a-- Uh, come on in.
Welcome.
It's great to see you guys.
This is a surprise.
What the hell is going on?
You're changing the direction
on this project without my authorization?
Okay, wh--
- Shut up. I'm not finished.
- Okay, listen--
- I'm shutting this operation down.
- Wait--
- It's over.
- You made this up?
Okay, yes.
I made up a mission.
But that's because I wanted to make sure
it would work before I brought it to you.
I think I may have solved
the Moon problem.
Just-- Trust me.
Watch this.
Sorry.
- [film rolling]
- Ignore this. Ignore this.
[Matt] So that's just sand.
Williams is in the suit.
We shot it in slow motion.
You understand?
I'm saying we could fake the Moon landing,
and it wouldn't be hard.
All people want to see is an image
on a television screen
and we can give them that.
The rocket will go up,
we'll send our footage with them,
and the astronauts will just beam it
back to Earth.
No one is going to think this is fake,
because how insane would that be?
And if we do it right,
this is the kind of thing
that sells itself.
Walter Cronkite is going
to do half the work for us.
Let me try.

we'll be working together again.
Welcome to Texas.
Congratulations on having Brackett
approve this insane mission.
You guys are filming this right now?
Yeah, we film everything.
It's a documentary.
It's a documentary.
Okay, before we get started on this,
I know you're technically my boss,
but I'm running all this.
Yeah.
No, I'm here because you have no idea
what you're doing.
So I'm in charge and you don't run
a goddamn thing.
So no more fucking around
behind our backs, all right?
Wow, I heard
it's pretty shitty.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Enjoying the 4th of July?
Yes, I'm in a great mood.
This is a bit of a party for me, too,
because we got a big promotion.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
[white noise]
[Matt] Somebody just
tell me what's wrong.
[Andy] Is that--
That's the barbecue.
Yeah. 6764. Just...
The barbecue what? What happened
at the barbecue? What's going on?
Watch.
Right...
There. See that?
- Yeah, two guys.
- Yeah. Look at this.
[sighs]
So he's holding something,
we're thinking maybe Super 8.
It could be
a 35mm still camera.
And do we know who this is?
Maybe they're NASA guests.
Yeah, I don't know.
Tourists? Who knows, right?
[sighs]
It could be nothing.
- It is nothing...
- [knocking on door]
Who is it?
It's Boles.
[whispering indistinctly]
This looks like shit.
[film stops]
You have one guy
in a space suit,
- prancing around on the sand...
- [Matt stammers]
...with one rock.
Who do you think
this is gonna convince?
I-- It convinced Brackett.
Well, now you have
to convince me.
What are you talking about?
Nobody is going to buy this.
I thought you were advocating
for me to do this!
I was advocating
for Operation Northwoods.
I think this idea's ridiculous.
[door opens and closes]
[door slamming]
[Matt] Mike, do you remember mentioning,
uh, test locations
that NASA was using
for photography?
Would you mind
showing me those pictures?
You mean on camera, or...?
- If you don't mind.
- I don't mind.
These are places
that look like the Moon on Earth?
Exactly. These are called
geology field trips.
So you're saying that the rocks
that are on the Moon
are the exact same
as the rocks on Earth?
- I'm not saying exact. I'm saying--
- But they're close?
They're close enough that...
that... Yeah, I mean...
So if you saw them,
you would think that, uh...
Oh, yeah, you can get an igneous rock
from a volcano here in America
and tell somebody it's a moon rock
and they wouldn't know.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Hello. Is Owen home?
- Hmm.
He's in the garage.
You look great.
FBI!
Look at this!
The geologists have places on Earth
that already look like the Moon.
This is the Barringer Crater,
the Grand Canyon.
We shoot this test footage
and then compare it
with the real moon footage
that they're getting from the missions.
I just figured this out!
Yeah, I can't go on this trip.
[stammering] What?
What do you mean? Why?
- Because I-- because I--
- I need you.
If you don't come with me,
I'm going with Boles, by myself.
What? Are you still mad at me?
I'm sorry. I didn't...
- [Julie] Owen!
- One second!
- [stammers] I...
- Listen.
- You have to forgive me for this.
- I can't go.

Operation Deep Red?

"No, of course I'd like to say hello!"
Of course I'd like to say hello.
And I'm watching something.
Would you mind giving me that?

Hi, could you give me the phone number

Of course not. No. And--

Oh, thank you.

I'm calling from NASA.
I'm making a documentary here

Ah.
What are you guys doing over there,

Stanley Kubrick is making a new movie
about the Moon landing,
and I'm willing to bet that we can use
the special effects
that he's doing there to do this.
[Owen] Okay, but...
We can't just walk onto the film set.
He has two NASA scientists
advising him.
We're going to go and say
we're going to interview them.
Do you see
what's going on here?
Kubrick is getting NASA
to make sure that his space movie
looks like real space.
And so we're going
to use his space movie
to make sure the real space movie
looks like space!
Do you see how crazy that is?

You'll have to shut it off

No problem.
Is Mr. Kubrick inside?
He is, but security
is very tight.
You'll be thrown off the set if you try
to approach him, so please don't.
- You got it.
- Go ahead.
Thank you.
[Madeleine]
Please wait right here.
Yeah, sure.
We'll stay right here.
[Kubrick] It might be better
to just play it as a medium shot
- in this situation.
- [man] Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Can you do it

What about out there?
[Kubrick] Well, that's not bad.
Let's do that.
Right.

I would never normally do this,
but it's for a friend.
- His name is Matt Johnson.
- Mm-hmm.
[Matt] Jared, tell me
you are getting this.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me?
How, um... how'd you set this up?
Owen, it's called
front screen projection!
We got it!
Kubrick's technique,
how he's faking...
I wanna--
I wanna tell you.
Boles, hey. It's called
front screen projection.
We figured out how to--
how to do it.
Yeah, okay, all right.
I'll, uh...
Do you want us
to fly right there, or...?
Sure.
[receiver clicks]
All right, it's called
front screen projection.
Stanley Kubrick can fake
any environment he wants,
by projecting it
through a semi-transparent mirror
and then onto a gigantic silver screen.
Then he films the entire scene
through the same mirror
at a 90-degree angle
to the projector.
What it winds up doing
is creating images
where you can't tell
where the stage stops...
and the fake photographic
background begins.
You have an infinite depth of field
into environments that exist completely
in two-dimensional space.
We can do the same thing
with the lunar surface photography
that NASA is taking
on the Apollo missions.
[projector clicking]
♪♪
Movie special effects
can be very convincing,
especially when you don't know you're
watching a movie.
The plan is to rent
a film studio in Texas,
hire a crew, and have them build
our own lunar lander.
We'll mix this practical set piece,
with Kubrick's projection technique,
and presto, the illusion that man
is walking on the Moon.
Now I know you're probably thinking
this is too much exposure,
and that the risk of bringing in outsiders
is too high,
but we already have the perfect cover.
We're making a documentary
about the Moon landing.
And it's not a stretch to say that we're
building sets to conduct interviews,
shoot B-roll footage.
We could even say
it's for simulations.
Hell, most of the major networks
are doing this already.
The only people who need to know what's
actually happening are the astronauts,
who you should select
based on their willingness to cooperate,
and James Webb, who's either
going to have to work with us
or get out of the way.
And that's the easy part.
We also need to convince
everybody at NASA.
The good news is, the only people
who are in contact with the rocket
are all in one room in Houston,
inside Mission Control.
If we can convince Mission Control
that what they're doing is real,
everybody else will follow.
How do we do that?
Well, Mission Control
actually monitors everything,
from the heart rates
of the astronauts,
to the exact location of the lunar module
as it descends to the Moon.
And they're getting all this information
through radio, directly from the ship.
The good news is that they've run
so many tests with this exact mission
that they actually have telemetric data
of successful lunar landings,
stored on guidance systems
on Apollo 11.
Here's where we get very lucky.
As the command module passes along
to the dark side of the Moon,
the radio signals
can't penetrate the core.
For 30 minutes, we have a window
for the astronauts to switch
from real data to fake telemetric data.
Mission control will be getting
data of the lunar module
undocking and landing
on the lunar surface,
but it will be completely faked.
Combine that with our footage
that the astronauts are going to pipe into
the broadcast back to Earth,
and nobody's
going to have any idea.
As far as NASA and the rest of the world
is concerned,
the United States
just landed on the Moon.
Finally, the broadcast.
To shoot in slow motion,
we have to shoot film.
To broadcast,
it needs to be video.
Which means we have to do a transfer,
which normally would be fine,
except that people cannot know
it originally began as film.
That means a single scratch,
any dust...
[Brackett] Okay, okay.
We got it.
Thank you for the presentation.
- You can go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.
[softly] Talk to your folks
about the Northwoods plan.
Tell them to put a hold on it
and we'll see how this develops.
Director, what is
the Northwoods plan?
I've never heard of
Operation Northwoods.
Shoot down Apollo 11
and blame the Soviets.
[stammering]
With the astronauts on the flight?
Why would we do that?
If your film doesn't come together,
then we have to have
a backup plan.
And that is our backup plan.
[whirring]
...plan? I've never heard
of Operation Northwoods.
Shoot down Apollo 11

[clicks off]
[whirring]
[man on TV] Who were these men
going to the Moon?
David Schoumacher profiled
the crew of Apollo 11.
Neil Armstrong, the man chosen to be
first to step upon the Moon.
He is by all accounts intelligent,
courteous, sober, a good family man.
He is perfect for the role,
beyond what a Hollywood scriptwriter
would dare.
Buzz Aldrin is perhaps the most brilliant
of the astronauts,
some say even a genius.
His doctorate at MIT came after a thesis
on orbital rendezvous,
and he understands the abstract theory
of space mechanics as well as anyone.
Mike Collins is the least technical
in outlook of the Apollo 11 astronauts,
but the most philosophical.
If he does not love machines,
he does love wine,
and books, and roses.
A man who has known all three pilots
for many years
says if he were
forced down on an island,
he would want it to be with Collins
for the quality of his personality.
Another said he would prefer Aldrin,
because, with his intelligence,
he would soon be converting seawater
to fresh water
and otherwise logically
attacking the problem.
But both agreed
in the final analysis,
that they would hope
it was with Armstrong,
because, somehow,
he would get them off of it.

so that I might retire

Today, we have reviewed
the progress we have made
and the President has agreed
that I could retire on October 7th,
when I will be 62.

The Flight of Apollo 8.
Six days
to the Moon and back.
Brought to you
by Walter Cronkite.
The flight of Apollo 8 is over.
And all that remains is to remove
the astronauts from the space craft,
and carry them less than two miles
to the deck of the carrier Yorktown.
Future plans for space missions,
of course,
have been accelerated considerably.
It means that they can keep
to the hoped-for schedule
of the next Apollo 9 mission,
late in February or early in March,
to test out the landing module,
and, uh, then move on towards
landing a man on the Moon
two flights further on
in the middle of July.
[Boles] So we've got
good news and bad news.
The good news: his name
is Antonin Lhotsky.
- [Matt] Uh-huh.
- [Boles] He's a KGB agent.
He's the man from outside the studio
the other night.
Whoa, what?
We suspect he's been the mole
the entire time.
S-- so then he knows
about Avalanche. We're fucked!
We don't think he does.
We've been interrogating him

He doesn't seem to know anything.
We've raided his house. Nothing.

And you-- you got him?
We got him.
So, then... what?
We're just... We're good?
Well, not entirely.
We, uh, got some new Intel
on the Soviet progress,
and it turns out they're doing better
than we thought.
It looks like they could possibly make it
to the Moon by the end of '69.
Which means that we need to be done
by April, at the latest.
Yeah, that puts us

I don't think
that Lhotsky's the mole.

was outside the studio.

to organize and measure
the best of our energies and skills.
Because that challenge is one
that we're willing to accept,
one we are unwilling to postpone,
and one we intend to win,
and the others, too.
[applause]
We shall send to the Moon,
240, 000 miles away from the control
station in Houston,
a giant rocket,
more than 300 feet tall,
the length of this football field,
made of new metal alloys,
some of which have not yet been invented,
capable of standing heat and stresses
several times more than have ever
been experienced,
on an untried mission
to an unknown celestial body,
and then return it safely to Earth,
re-entering the atmosphere
at speeds of over 25, 000 miles per hour.
And do all this... And do all this
and do it right, and do it first,
before this decade is out,
then we must be bold.
[applause]
And therefore, as we set sail,
we ask God's blessing on the most
hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure on which man
has ever embarked.
Thank you.
[applause]
[Boles] So this is the only copy?
Yeah. So... now what?
We just bring it to Brackett?
Oh, I'll take it to Brackett.
You stay here and clean up.
Clean up what?
Clean up the studio.
Destroy everything.
What if we--
What if we need that stuff?
We won't. Good work.
- Thanks.
- I'll see you soon.
Hey, Boles.
[stammers]
Lhotsky wasn't the mole, was he?
What are you talking about?
[chuckles]
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know.
I've been working on
this too long. I'm sorry.
Well, get some rest.
I'll see you soon.
- [door opens]
- Bye, buddy.
[door closes]
[sighs]
[clicking]
[whirring]
[clicking]
[film winding]
He's gonna spot one of our guys pretending
to be a rocket scientist instantly.
We need to send people who are gonna look
like they have no idea what's going on.
[film winding]
They can't make it to the Moon.
I'm gonna tell you what they said.
[indistinct talking]
[Owen] ...an ethical problem
with this at all?
- ♪ You don't know... ♪
- [clicking]
[clicking]
[music playing on tape]
[Owen] He let them get away!
That's what you did.
- [Boles] Oh, really?
- [Owen] Yes, you missed on purpose!
[Matt] Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What-- what are you doing?
What are you doing?
We're friends!
- [Owen] Who are they? Who are...
- [Matt] We're friends.
[Boles] What, you think
that's your friend?
- Who, Brackett? The CIA?
- Why don't you tell him about how...
[marker squeaking]
[breathing heavily]
[panting]
[car engine revving]
[engine stops]
[car door opens]
[car door closes]
Hey, Julie.
Can I borrow your husband?
- He what? Oh.
- Simon's asleep. Inside.
- I can go inside, so you guys can talk.
- You can stay outside.
No, I don't need to talk.
I wanna know if, um...
If you wanna... We're-- we're going
to get rid of the stuff from work.
You can go if you want.
No, I'm going to stay here.
How's Simon? Are you guys excited
about the big launch?
[chuckles]
Okay. Have a good afternoon.
[Julie] Thanks. You, too.
I'll see you soon, okay?
Yeah, bye.
[Cronkite] Good morning.
It's T-minus one hour, 29 minutes
and 53 seconds and counting.
In just an hour and a half,
if all goes well,
Apollo 11 astronauts
Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins
are to lift off
from Pad 39-A out there
on the voyage man
always has dreamed about.
Next stop for them,
the Moon.
And we are all about to witness
the fulfillment of that promise
that President Kennedy made
at Rice University Stadium in Texas,
on September 12, 1962.
We passed 10,000 odd cars
parked around the Gate-1 area
at 4:00 a.m. when we got here.
Cars from every state,
with little kids staring wide-eyed,
and we saw teenagers
with telescopes.
It was a very moving scene for me,
because Americans cared then,
I think, and they care now.
And it says, "Good luck... good luck,
Apollo 11" engraved in the sand.
All going very smoothly here
with the count.
[Mission Control]
T-minus 60 seconds and counting.
We've passed T-minus 60.
Power transfer is complete.
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...
Ignition sequence starts.
Six, five, four, three, two, one.
[Frank Reynolds] And good afternoon
from ABC space headquarters in New York.
With me is our science editor,
Jules Bergman, and we are on the air today
to bring you a complete report
on some very, very important maneuvers
- to be performed by Apollo 11.
- [phone rings]
Basically in position to begin
the process...
- Hello?
- [Owen] Matt?
[chuckling] Are you--
are you seeing this right now?
[Owen] Matt, they're not dead.
The CIA lied to us.
[stammering]
Wait, what?
[Owen] The men following us at the studio
are outside my house.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, meet me at your motel.
- [line disconnects]
- [dial tone]
What the hell?
[knocking on door]
Owen?
Hello?
Who's there?
Oh, shit.
Okay, okay, okay.
[breathing heavily]
Uh... Uh...
Where's the other car?
Where's the--
[Jared] Um, um, out back.
Out back.
[TV playing indistinct]
[Matt] Okay, stand back.
[grunting]
[groaning]
[breathing heavily]
Sorry.
[man on TV]...in a delirium
of enthusiasm today...
[panting]
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Owen.
Come on!
[Jared] Matt!
What?
There's a car!
Jared, run!
- Shit.
- Go, go, go.
[radio playing indistinct]
Andy, hold on.
Fuck!
They're right behind us.
They're right behind us.
[tires screeching]
Get their faces!
Get their faces, Andy! Get their faces!
[Andy]
This is fucking crazy!
- Oh, God!
- Oh, Christ!
- [Andy] He's got a gun!
- What?
- He's got a fucking gun!
- Okay, duck, duck, duck!
[groans]
Oh, shit.
[panting]
[shooting continues]
[engine backfires]
[Andy]
What's happening?
- [engine stalling]
- Uh...
Oh, fuck. Fuck!
Jesus!
[engine starts]
[Matt] Okay, okay.
[Andy] Get out of here.
Get out of here.
- I'm trying.
- Get out of here.
Dude, they're
right in front of us.
Yeah, I know.
[tires screeching]
They're gonna ram us,
they're gonna ram us!
- [gunshot]
- [Andy groans]
Oh!
[car radio continues playing indistinct]
Owen!
Owen! Owen!
Owen!
Owen!
[gasps]
[car approaching]
So they're not all labeled, right?
It goes '67, '68, '69. But not
everything's... Not everything's marked.
Well, you'll figure it out.
Hey.
Okay, man.
As soon as I know where we're going,
I'll call you.
Yeah.
- [dial tone]
- [coins tinkling]
[dialing phone]
[line ringing]
[man on phone]
Good evening.
Hello, there's a man at the end of the bar
wearing glasses.
Could you please give
the phone to him?
Telephone.
Hello?
[Matt] You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?
We're looking for you.
Where you been?
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
let's make a trade.
Okay.
My location for the names of the agents
on your kill team.
We don't have any kill team.
Yeah, well, who killed Owen
and hung him in his garage?
Okay. Come down to the office.
We'll discuss it.
[scoffs]
Yeah, I'll come in.
No, I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.
I have a film
of everything we did.
I have proof that the CIA conspired
to fake the Moon landing
and that Owen Williams is the one
that everybody is about to see walk
on the Moon,
and that you killed him
to keep it a secret!
I even got you planning Northwoods,
the same as I got you right now.
No one will take that seriously, kid.
Yeah, well, call my bluff.
My last movie's about to convince
the world we went to the Moon.
Then why don't I make you a deal?
Come back and work for us,
and I'll make you the head
of your own department.
[Matt chuckles]
[laughing] Yeah, how stupid
do you think I am?
[Brackett sighs]
I'll tell you what.
Keep the film as collateral if you don't
believe me. Just think about it.
[dial tone]
[breathing heavily]
[Neil Armstrong]
...the surface appears to be, uh,
very, very fine grained
as you get close to it.
It's almost like a powder...
down there, uh, it's very fine.
Okay, I'm going to step off the LM now.
That's one small step for man...
one giant leap for mankind.
And the...

is fine and powdery.

[astronaut 1] Okay, we shouldn't take
any more pictures on this roll
until Earth comes, I don't think.
This is about out... it's just about out
until our last color roll,
so, uh, we'll switch to black and white
as soon as we get to Earth.
- [astronaut 2] We might make it in time.
- Yeah.
- There it is, it's coming up.
- What?
- The Earth.
- You see it?
Yeah.
Beautiful.
It's halfway up.
