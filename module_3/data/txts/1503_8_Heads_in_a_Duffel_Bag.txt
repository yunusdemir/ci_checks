Die, sbumbags!
Get the works going.
We got to get the hell
out of here.
You're late, Tommy.
Rico. Relax.
OK, Benny.
You're the boss. Come on.
That's Hugo Porto's mob?
Tried to move in on Big Sep's
territory in Atlantic City.
Killed Vicor Viking's mom
in the process.
- What a bunch of scumbags.
- Whatever.
There's proof for Big Sep
and a ticket on the redeye.
The heads are nice and clean
and ready to go.
OK.
Tommy, Big Sep's hot.
I'm two weeks late
delivering the meat.
If he doesn't get that
by noon tomorrow...
more heads are going to roll.
No problem.
Do you love me?
I'm in the groove
Do you love me?
Dance
Watch me now
Take care.
Have a good trip now.
Checking that one?
Ticket, sir?
Here you go.
Where you headed?
San Diego?
Mexico. Eventually.
- You have a good flight.
- Thanks a lot.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Dance...
How you doing?
That goes right on top.
Come here.
Up, up.
See how that fits.
Here.
- It's this thing. There.
- Thank you.
Ma'am, step over here, please.
Need to check your pockets...
Got a gun!
- Get it away from her!
- Get her hand!
I don't own a gun!
Ma'am, stop struggling.
Be a lot easier.
Kid, is this yours?
Yeah.
Do me a favor.
Put that under the seat.
Maybe you can keep that
with you.
I got some important stuff
in this bag.
I'd like to keep it close by me.
Thanks.
That's really nice of you.
Good kid. Thank you.
Attaboy.
It fits right under there.
No, it doesn't fit
right under there.
Maybe you'll get a spot
in another bin.
I appreciate that.
It's nice of you.
Excuse me.
Careful. Careful.
I almost didn't make it.
I'm sure
someone's glad you did.
You're 49-C.
It's right down this way.
Thanks.
Sir, it's right here.
Baby stuff. Let me see.
Excuse me, sir.
Is this yours?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. We need to use
this compartment.
Would you mind
using another one?
I have valuable
family heirlooms in there.
As you can plainly see,
this is an emergency situation.
Maybe you can use
somebody else's bin.
This kid's not using his.
Would you mind...
Excuse me, but screw you.
Come on, be nice.
Be a gentleman.
We're trying to help.
Let me help you.
This goes right under here.
- Wait.
- This is small.
That's OK. Thanks.
Don't kick it!
For God's sake!
Those are live human organs!
Trust me, pal.
They don't feel it.
Would you sit down, please?
I'm really sorry about that.
Sir, we have to use your bin.
Exbuse me.
Acually, sir,
your bag is over the limit.
The guy outside measured this
and said it was OK.
Sir, it's clearly
over the size limit.
It has to go in cargo.
Listen, wait a minute.
Hold on a second. Listen.
Maybe we could
leave my bag where it is?
Are you bribing me, sir?
No. I'm purchasing
a place for my bag.
The place for your bag
is in cargo, sir.
Excuse me.
I'll take another flight.
The next flight to San Diego
leaves in seven hours.
Let me make a phone call.
Do you acually think we'll wait
while you use the phone?
Are you flying
with us tonight or not?
All right, Miss Burke.
That's your name, right?
This bag better be in San Diego
or you're in a lot of trouble.
It will be the very first
off the plane.
Does that make you happy?
When it's there,
then I'll be happy.
Have a seat, please.
Thank you.
Happy? Yeah, I'm happy.
Thrilled. Happy.
What are you looking at?
You started this
with those frigging organs.
You're happy, right? Happy!
Look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot.
I'm Charlie.
So, where you headed?
I'm going to meet
my girlfriend's parents.
She races these cars.
She's great.
I wish her parents
thought the same of me.
I'm meeting them
for the first time.
I haven't seen her
in six months...
I'm going to sleep.
Think about what
you'll say to them.
I don't know,
because I haven't met them.
The father doesn't like me.
I understand that.
I just met you,
and I don't like you.
I got to sleep.
Didn't you hear me?
I'm just making conversation.
Make it in sign language.
Laurie?
- Is something wrong?
- No.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
What is the matter?
Nothing.
Let's talk about it later.
OK.
No.
No. Jesus, please, no.
Charlie Pritchett? Shit!
What do you have in there?
Looks like
you packed for a month.
You know me.
Ready for anything.
Oh, boy.
Look at this loser.
Wooly, be nice, now.
Come on.
Charlie, these are my parents,
Annette and Dick.
It's a real pleasure.
Very nice to meet you.
This is for you.
These wrappings are beautiful.
Thank you.
Oh, my God, Dick.
I left yours on the plane.
Call the airline.
We got a long ride.
Sorry.
Wudji, why don't you ride
shotgun with your dad?
"Wudji"?
Wudji like me to drive?
I think I can handle it.
No...
No. Jesus.
House of pain.
Hello, who's this?
This is Qaddafi.
Who's this?
Qaddafi, huh?
Listen, this is Bill.
I'm an old friend
of Charlie Prichett's.
I was wondering
if you could help me find him.
He's on spring break
with the rest of America.
Did you try looking in Mexico?
Ver funny.
This is really important.
Do you think you could be
more specific?
Not unless it's for a grade.
Bill, is it?
Tell me if this sounds like
a phone hanging up.
Yeah.
Shit! Shit!
Shit!
I need a flight
to Bethesda University.
I'm not sure the university
has their own airport...
but we can fly you to Baltimore.
Will that do?
Don't get cute with me,
asshole.
Wake up, we're here.
Made it in record time.
I'm famished.
Me, too.
I could use a margarita.
- What time is it?
- 1350 hours.
Bear...
remember what we agreed
about your drinking?
You would be a good Bear.
Take one of your new pills.
They make me woozy, Wooly.
I said I could use a drink.
I didn't say I'm having one.
Listen, there is absolutely
nothing in this whole world...
that could ever, ever make me
take a drink again.
So relax, OK?
Bienvenidos.
Welcome back, señor.
Hope you catch
the big one this time.
Benny?
I ran into a little delay here.
What do you mean, a delay?
Excuse me,
are you going to be long?
- A day, maybe two.
- On the phone?
What?
What the hell happened?
I can't go into it,
but it'll be OK.
Can't you talk to Big Sep?
Big Sep is riding me
like a racehorse.
I told you we was late.
The job is finished.
What's the big deal
with the delivery?
You didn't lose nothing,
did you?
You know how many years
I did this for your father?
How could you ask me that?
Mister...
Lady, you interrupt me
one more time...
you're gonna swallow
this phone.
Go ahead!
Take it on the heels!
One day.
You got one day, Tommy.
If Big Sep doesn't get
those heads by noon tomorrow...
you might as well
chop off your own head...
and put it
in with the others.
Don't worry about it.
He'll have them
before they start stinking.
Please.
Or you'll be stinking.
I know what you mean.
It's about time.
Yeah, I know.
Here. It's all yours.
We've done
a lot of redecorating...
since you've been here, señor.
It's quite lovely.
We hope you enjoy it.
Señor Pritchett, your room.
Thank you.
Minibar, the bathroom.
If you need anything,
please call me.
Everbody, unpack later.
They're only serving lunch
for ten more minutes.
Yes, sir. No problem.
Come on, Bear.
- I'm coming, Wooly.
- It's 206.
Can we keep the puppy, Wooly?
Laurie, what's going on?
Nothing.
Let's talk about it later.
No. Let's talk about it now.
Look, Charlie...
I don't know
quite how to put this...
but...
I think I want a divorce.
What? A divorce?
We're not even married.
Or engaged.
You know what I mean.
You invited me here
to tell me this?
Why'd you invite me
to meet your parents?
I didn't really invite you.
Excuse me, but...
you invited me
to your parents' house...
and then you said
we're coming to Mexico instead.
When I said
we were going to Mexico...
I didn't mean you.
What?
It was supposed to be
me and my parents...
and you got so excited...
I didn't know how
to break it to you.
Laurie, what's happened to you?
Six months at home,
and you've mutated...
from a fun-loving free spirit
into Nancy Reagan.
I just want stability
in my life, Charlie.
I need to be with someone
who knows who they are...
and knows
what they want in life.
Know what this is about?
Your folks.
They don't like me.
It's affecting the way
that you feel about me...
but just wait, Laurie.
My being here will be
a blessing in disguise.
I'm not giving up on you.
Is my hair all right?
I am open-minded.
He's such a dip!
A dip?
I think he's really cute.
He seems funny and smart.
What do you want for her?
I want what I was
when I was his age.
I was charismatic...
ambitious...
I was clearly headed
to the top.
Clearly, darling.
The very, very top.
We can be honest
with each other...
when we're alone, can't we?
I think
that's a good idea, Wooly.
I always wanted to be...
I forgot something!
Will you go get us a table?
- What's the problem?
- I forgot something.
I'll be there in a second.
I'm running.
Señora, no.
Decoration, not for sale.
Sorry.
I better check on Bear.
Mrs. Bennett.
There you are.
We ordered you an enchilada.
Are you all right?
Mrs. Bennett...
Jesus, Mom, are you OK?
Would you like to sit?
What are you doing?
Don't tell me
you've been drinking.
Remember what the docor said.
Take nice, deep breaths.
I have some pills
if you're not feeling well.
That's a good idea.
It's... all right, folks.
She's just a little hungry.
She's hungry
and her blood sugar's dropped.
Are you hungry, Bear?
Mom, for God's sake!
Would you like an enchilada?
It's all right, folks.
No harm done.
They're just
happy to see each other.
You little son of a bitch.
I should've known.
Shit!
Wake up, Qaddafi.
We're gonna play College Bowl.
For 10 points and your life...
Stevie, you got any notes
from last night?
I don't need them.
No, I've got it.
Thank you ver much.
Señorita,
your mother will be fine.
Take this, please.
I gave her a sedative.
It's muy, muy strong.
Let her rest.
Thank you, docor.
We've been here an hour
and she's on the booze.
Go easy on her.
She's obviously
under a lot of stress.
When she wakes up,
we won't mention a thing.
OK, Laurie?
Why don't you watch her
while Charlie and I go...
rent a boat for tomorrow?
OK, Charlie?
Yeah. Great.
Is my hair OK?
Do you mind if I change
my shirt before we go?
No. I'll use the phone
in your room...
so I won't disturb her.
We're gonna
play a game called...
"Be honest with me."
The rules are very simple.
I ask you a question...
and you have
to be honest with me.
Where'd Charlie Pritchett
go on vacation?
Second rule...
you have to answer, Qaddafi.
Why does he keep
calling me Qaddafi?
Look, I don't want
to put you kids through hell.
So...
let me tell you
what's gonna happen here.
First, I'm gonna hurt you.
Then you'll try to be brave.
I'll hurt you again,
and you'll tell me everthing.
We don't know anything.
That's not being honest.
That's not honest.
Now, look.
This is not getting easier.
It'll only get harder.
I don't know why
you're protecting this kid.
Because I'll find him.
Here we go. Attaboy.
I swear to God,
we don't know where he is.
All he said was Mexico...
Come on!
We're not
tring to protect him!
I won't repeat myself.
Mom, if you want to come down,
you're welcome.
It's just that the weather
is terrible.
It's rained
since we got here, Mom.
There's storms everwhere.
More storms are on the way.
I'm just thinking about you.
What the hell?
Of course we'd love
your company, Mom.
I know you're young enough
to travel.
It has nothing to do
with that.
Mom, please,
don't dredge that up.
What's the matter?
Ants! Ants!
They're everwhere!
I don't see any ants.
What are you talking about?
There are ants down here.
Ants everwhere.
Please don't dredge that up.
It's got nothing to do
with her!
What is it?
I... I have
a cramp in my leg.
A cramp?
Pull yourself together.
Stop screaming!
Mom, sorry.
No, Mom, I'm not arguing
with my wife...
I'm arguing with you!
I'll have to call you back.
I'll call you right back.
Will you keep it down?
Why don't I meet you
downstairs in five minutes?
Five minutes!
Don't send this laundry out.
It'll cost me an arm and a leg.
God...
Obviously, this is...
This isn't real.
It's... it's...
it's a fake.
Are you OK?
I'm... I'm fine.
I ate a hot pepper.
Hot! Hot pepper!
No, no, no. Bad dog.
Charlie, are you OK?
I'm fine.
I ate a killer pepper.
A killer pepper. I'm fine.
There's some water
in the minibar...
No!
I like the sensation.
Enchilada!
Call me if you need anything.
Will do. Thank you, Paco.
- God!
- What's going on?
The police!
This has got to be a setup.
There's got to be a camera.
We're in Mexico.
Why would there be
a camera in Mexico?
Mexican "Candid Camera."
Still on the air!
Charlie!
You're acting insane.
Just get it together!
I'm OK. I'm OK.
What the hell's going on?
Laurie, promise you won't freak.
I found something
in my duffel bag.
Something.
I mean... it's a...
What?
Forget it. It's nothing.
Charlie Pritchett, you snake!
- You got me a present!
- No!
It's not a present, Laurie!
Laurie, don't open it.
It's a head!
Laurie?
Laurie! Are you OK?
Honey?
Are you all right?
She's fine.
Everthing's fine.
She had a pepper, too.
Loves them, acually.
Are you sure, señorita?
You call me
if you need anything.
Will do.
Thank you, Paco. Bye-bye.
Laurie, are you OK?
Can you stop screaming?
God, what are you doing
with a head in your bag?
I don't know.
You think I know?
Yes, I think you'd know!
If I had a head in my bag,
I think I'd know!
Don't get upset,
but there's more than one.
What?
Charlie, there's two?
No.
Three? Four? How many?
Eight.
Wait! Wait!
You're not in the hall.
You're in the closet.
Don't you think I realize that?
I'm not coming out.
I'm not!
You have to come out.
- No.
- The bodies are in there.
I was kidding.
You're kidding
at a time like this?
I had to calm you down.
For God's sake,
please stay calm.
You expect me to remain calm...
when you have eight human heads
in your luggage?
There may be two people in China
who didn't hear you!
What the hell's going on?
I wish I knew.
Could it be Steve or Ernie...
playing some sick,
hideous medical prank?
I don't think so.
The thought of
blood bothers Steve...
and this isn't Ernie's style.
They're my best friends...
but they're
dull guys with dull lives.
- Psycho!
- Jesus Christ!
We don't know anything!
I don't know shit!
You're right.
Besides, we only have access
to are cadavers.
These heads are fresh.
It's true.
Check it out for yourself.
No. Let's call the police.
No! No!
Why?
Because we're in Mexico.
A Third World country.
You don't call the police
in a Third World country...
and tell them you found
eight heads in your luggage!
- Why not?
- They have no laws here.
They'll turn me into a taco.
What do you suggest?
We have to think this
through rationally.
Oh, my God, Charlie.
What if they have your bag?
What?
What if the person who owns
this bag has your bag?
They'll come looking for you!
I just took
a mental inventory of my bag.
There's nothing in it that
could possibly lead them here.
His family
lives in Clarion, Vermont.
They're in
the furniture business.
Laurie's from Denver,
last name Bennett.
B-e-n-n-e-t-t.
On vacation in Mexico.
That's reassuring.
What do we do?
Simple.
All we have to do
is throw them away.
They lock the garbage.
Señor Pritchett?
- Paco.
- Can I help you?
No. Just putting the trash
in the garbage.
Putting the garbage
in the trash.
- I'll take it for you.
- No. I got it.
- What is it?
- None of your business.
What kind of garbage is it?
Aluminum, plastic?
We recycle here.
It's really not recyclable.
It's perishable.
Perishables we compost.
It's really not compostable.
Everthing perishable
is compostable.
Jesus Christ!
I mean, come on.
Sorry, señor.
Go ahead and put it in.
Thank you.
I'll take care of it later.
You know what? It's fine.
I'll just take it back.
It's really not that bad.
I just need a little oil
and formaldehyde and vinegar.
It'll be just as good as...
Are you sure, señor?
Yes. Thank you, Paco.
Mom, why are you bringing
my inheritance into this?
Excuse me!
You still haven't changed?
Well, I...
No, not you, Mom.
I found a rat in my room.
It had a ball of yarn...
I don't want to be rude,
but are you coming...
or am I gonna spend
the entire day in the lobby?
I'm so sorry.
I'll be right down.
What am I gonna do, flush them?
Nothing fits around here.
No, no, no!
Por favor, no clean.
No clean. Room clean.
- No clean.
- Gracias.
I'm asking you to come, Mom...
but there's really no need
for you to come.
It's 200 degrees here.
And you go in here.
Like... that.
Mom, if we're cut off,
it's the lightning.
Gotta go rent a boat.
I've got eight human heads
in my room...
and I gotta go rent a boat.
Mrs. Pritchett?
Hi. This is Ernie Lipscomb...
Charlie's friend
from medical school...
In Acapulco, please, then.
The numbers for as many hotels
as you can give me...
I know. It is late.
We've run into
a little situation up here...
The Mayan...
No. Relax.
Everthing's fine...
but I do need
to get ahold of Charlie.
Did he tell you
where he was staying in Mexico?
He didn't.
Right. No.
I know how sons can be.
That's the last one, right?
School's a little crazy.
You know how that goes.
Sure he's only
going away for a week?
He packed enough
stuff here for a year.
Charlie's a compulsive packer.
"Sleight of Mind"
by Charlie Pritchett.
He's writing a detecive novel.
Sounds like his autobiography.
It's a pun on sleight of hand
and dim-witted.
A pun. Play on words.
Get it?
No. Relax.
Everthing's fine.
I don't know.
We got midterms...
I'll talk to you soon.
Gotta go. Bye.
Shit.
I popped the last guy
who tried to pun me, asshole.
Get it?
You get it?
I can get it, too.
Make some more balls.
You, too, asshole.
This is none of my business,
hopefully...
but you've been
pre-law, pre-architect...
pre-vet, pre-med.
No. Real med.
Now you're thinking about
being a headshrinker.
A what?
Shrink. Headshrinker.
Psychoanalyst.
Whatever you call an overpaid
hand-holder these days.
Acually, sir,
I was thinking about that...
but I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.
- I'm aware of that.
- Dad, enough.
Annette?
Bear?
Wooly, are we alone?
We're alone, but where are you?
Oh, Wooly.
What are you doing there?
Wooly, thank God.
Thank God you're alive.
Of course I'm still alive.
Where's Laurie?
Oh, my God,
not with that maniac!
Calm down and tell me
what you're talking about.
Our daughter
is dating a mass murderer!
I went into his room
to put a gift in his bag...
and in his bag,
he's got body parts.
I sorry to scare you.
I just fixing the gutter.
Dick, I am not Crazy.
I know what I saw.
- And I believe you.
- No, you don't.
Remember what the docor
said about your drinking?
I did not hallucinate it.
I had the drink
after I saw them.
What about the pills?
I saw you take them.
You said they made you woozy.
Right.
But what about the bag?
Where's his bag?
I don't know...
but I was in his room
when he unpacked.
Right in front of me.
Would a maniac do that?
No.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no, no.
It's not my room.
It's not my room!
It is my room.
- What?
- We clean room.
What?
- Room clean.
- Oh, no.
Blind.
I'm blind.
I mean... you're blind.
I'm a guest...
and I forgot something.
I draw the line on mass graves.
Mass graves?
Maybe we should
do seven of them.
We don't have time.
This reminds me
of when I was a kid.
I was 13 years old...
and me and my friends...
used to rip the heads
off Barbie dolls...
and bury them in the mud
in the backyard.
Really?
You used to rip the head...
Find any buried treasures,
gringos?
We have laws
about these deserts.
They're environmentally
protected now.
Acually, we didn't know.
We got to protect the snakes...
protect the lizards,
protect the toads.
Are you familiar with
the Mexican horny toad?
Oh, no.
The Mexican horny toad
is a very special species.
It's against the law
to hurt a horny toad in any way.
She just hurt a horny toad!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
No! Shit!
They stole my car.
Go get them!
Dick is gonna kill me!
I want you to stay
here at your hotel.
You're much safer here.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
Señor?
You forgot your bag.
- Oh, jeez!
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you. Good night.
That went well.
Charlie, I got it. FedEx.
- What?
- FedEx them to Steve.
We're in Mexico.
There is no FedEx.
Then MexEx them.
The point is to ship them.
And let Steve innocently open
a package full of heads?
Of course not.
We'll call him.
Boys, I would like to do
this forever...
but I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to do.
It's time I got rid of you
and moved along.
Come over here.
You can't just kill us.
We're trying, all right?
What are you talking about?
This look like
the Special Olympics?
I need the bag.
Get over here!
Trying? Get down.
We can call more people.
Get down.
Can I answer that?
It might be Charlie.
Put it on speaker phone.
- Hello?
- Steve.
Charlie, thank God.
Listen to me, you asshole.
You got my heads,
and I want them back.
Who is this?
Never mind who this is.
I want those heads.
Jesus Christ.
The guy from the airplane.
Charlie, listen...
Does this look like
a family reunion?
What are you doing to Steve?
I'm killing him,
unless you shut up and listen.
Where are you?
I'm in Baja,
six hours south of San Diego.
You meet me at
the San Diego airport...
and bring all eight heads
with you.
San Diego airport?
I'm on vacation with
my girlfriend's parents.
OK! San Diego.
Make sure you're there by 6:00.
If you ain't there,
your buddies are history.
What if I don't have
all eight heads?
What?
I... I lost one.
You lost one?
How the hell could you lose one?
The maid got it.
What do you mean a maid?
How the hell...
- Which one did you lose?
- I don't know.
Jeez!
I can't believe this shit.
I don't believe this shit.
Damn it!
What's happening?
I don't think
he's taking it too well.
He's freaking out
This guy is serious.
He's a psycho.
Do what he says.
Are you there?
Listen to this.
Bring the rest
and make sure you're there.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- Before you hang up...
- What?
If you hurt my friends,
you'll never get them.
Are you threatening me?
No. I'm telling you a fact.
And don't lose my book.
It's my only copy.
Charlie...
All right. Forget the book.
I'll be there.
You better.
What's happening?
We have to go back to San Diego.
San Diego?
My dad will shoot himself.
What are we going to tell him?
He forgot to turn in
his lab report?
- I know it sounds flaky...
- It's ridiculous.
He came all the way to Mexico
without turning in a report...
and we have to go home?
Mom's sick,
and it's your fault.
My fault?
He took your advice.
He's decided on something.
He'll never be
a member of this family.
- We're leaving.
- How did he take it?
It falls into the category
of blessing in disguise.
I'll make it up to him.
I'll give him
a year of free analysis.
- Cute. Here.
- What's this?
A surprise for his birthday.
He likes macho stuff.
Pack it in your bag.
I don't want him to see it.
Where exactly would
you suggest that I put it?
If we're going, let's go.
Right, Dad.
The shirt's for you.
Get packing.
Laundry.
I didn't...
Hello.
Thank you.
I didn't...
Who's this guy?
He might do.
- Do for what?
- Hugo.
Wait a minute.
You want a look-alike
for the head Charlie lost?
Yeah.
We got some time
to kill before the airport.
Oh, my God.
These are college professors.
Innocent people.
You can't kill
innocent people...
because they look
like someone else.
Let me tell you something,
nobody's innocent.
Who is he?
My anatomy professor.
He almost flunked me.
Here's your chance to get even.
Get me his address.
Wait a minute.
I just thought of something.
- What?
- Cryonics.
- Cry what?
- Cryonics. Frozen bodies.
This university...
has the biggest Cryonics
Foundation in the country.
So what?
It could save you
a lot of trouble is so what.
You go on a killing spree,
Big Sep'll hear about it.
A couple of gangsters die,
nobody cares.
But you blow away professors,
Big Sep'll read about that.
Big Sep don't read.
Well, still,
this cryonics facility...
has hundreds of frozen heads.
Why they got hundreds
of frozen heads?
I think for situations
like this.
Don't be a little smartass.
They have them
because people are hoping...
that in
a couple of hundred years...
maybe they can bring them
back to life...
clone them a healthy body.
Are you jerking me around?
What? Oh, my God.
You put welts and bruises
over 90% of my body.
Now you're talking about
decapitating some professor.
Would I be jerking you around?
Calm down, tough guy.
What are you telling me?
I'm tring to tell you
that right across campus...
is a gold mine of heads.
Heads "R" Us.
Night of a Thousand Heads.
If I was a guy
in desperate need of a head...
as you are...
I'd at least check it out.
Señor, I can't find
your Jeep anywhere.
What do you mean? It's red.
Oh, my God. I forgot.
We went for
a drive last night...
and it got stolen.
You forgot it was stolen?
Well, we...
This is ridiculous.
How do we get out of here?
No problem, señor.
Take a plane.
And where would
we take a plane from?
Here.
Since you've been away...
this has become
a very important city.
We have our own airport.
A plane comes ever day.
Aren't we lucky?
Now, that's a Hugo.
This one's good?
For Hugo Porto,
it's unbelievable.
We got a keeper.
- What was that?
- Thawing it out.
No way.
Good God, look at that.
Lassie, sit, girl. Stay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Guys. Ernie.
What?
I'm not very comfortable.
Why is that?
We're messing with
people's immortality here.
It's murder.
Technically,
it's not murder, Steve.
They're already dead.
These people believed
in this freezing thing.
This is like grave robbing.
Or worse.
I don't see any graves.
Do you see any graves?
There's gonna be
two fresh ones right now...
if you two don't
start looking for heads.
All right.
Sir, I'm really sorry
about the Jeep.
It's open seating.
Take these tickets
and check in the big stuff.
We'll take the little stuff
and get the seats.
Do you think
you can handle that?
I really appreciate...
Come on, Bear. Come here.
Do you have anything
to declare?
Any fruits, vegetables,
native plants?
Are you kidding?
I'll get it.
Excuse me. Could you
hand me my bag, please?
I don't have un momento.
I have un plane-o to catch-o.
Excuse me. I can see it.
I'll reach in and get it myself.
What? Is it Dad?
Is it Dad?
What?
They found two heads
in Dad's carry-on.
Oh, no.
Put me down! Put me down!
Oh, my God.
Help me! Help me!
Oh, my God.
Decent. Hold this one.
Yeah? Wait.
Do you need a Helen?
Play with her when I leave.
Get over there.
This guy do anything for you?
He's not bad either.
Could be a Stu.
Yeah? We could
beat him up a little bit.
Give him a few buts.
Random disfigurement.
Yeah. Definitely a Stu.
It's worth a try anyway.
I'll take him and him.
Great. I'll wrap them up.
What do you mean... take?
You know...
for a future doctor...
you're a pretty stupid kid.
I mean... take the heads.
No. No. No way.
You do it.
This was your crazy idea.
It's my idea
that you should do it.
He's the neurologist.
I'm going into dermatology.
So don't screw up the skin.
There's a pleasant sound.
Mr. Escobedo,
this is my mother, Charlie...
and Fern Bennett, Dad's mom.
She flew down to help us
out with bail.
Nona, this is
Dad's Mexican lawyer.
- Delighted.
- Charmed.
Cut the crap and tell us
what the hell's going on.
Certainly.
In your country, you have...
what you call the good news
and the bad news.
The good news is...
Mr. Bennett underwent
only very mild torture.
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God.
Shut up, you poodle.
What's the bad news?
He confessed
and was sentenced to death.
- Oh, my God!
- That little weakling.
Wait a minute.
Don't get upset yet.
Not get upset?
Let the man speak, damn it.
There are remedies here.
This is a civilized country.
Surely there's
going to be a trial?
When my partner arrives,
we will formulate our strategy.
Until then, try to relax.
It's a beautiful day.
Enjoy Mexico.
I can't believe it.
Things get a little rough,
he cracks.
Nona, they tortured him.
So what? A little castor oil
down his gullet?
A little elecricity
on his dillywhacker?
Cat piss.
I am spent.
Chopping off heads
just takes it out of you.
Shit. Time to go.
I got four heads.
I'm screwed.
You got a good start.
I'm sure one of those will do.
I doubt it,
the way my luck's running today.
Let's take a second...
and take stock
of where we are so far.
Let me tell you something, kid.
Just so you know.
I gotta kill the both of you.
Don't think by helping me,
it's gonna change.
Yeah, I know. Sure.
I'm just saying that
you're doing all right.
You might be better off
than you think.
But I'm just saying, too,
I want you to know.
Let's see.
I got a Hugo, a Marty...
a so-so Stu, and a bad Frank.
Right.
And then at the morgue...
you said something
about Little Joey.
Right.
So I got Little Joey...
a Hugo, a Marty,
and a bad Frank.
Now, where's Stu?
I said Stu. So-so Stu.
No. Just a second ago,
you said Little Joey.
I know I said Little Joey,
but I also said Stu.
But then where's Frank?
Look, start over.
You got a Hugo...
a Little Joey...
a Frank...
a bad Stu...
No. Frank. Bad Frank.
That's what I said.
You said bad Stu.
Stu was just so-so.
No, sir.
I said a so-so Stu.
You said bad Stu.
Yes, I did.
Everone heard.
I said a so-so Stu.
You said bad Stu.
I know the names,
and you don't!
Will you two stop it?
God damn it!
These are not baseball bards
we're talking about here.
These are heads.
Human beings' heads.
Where were we? I said...
I got a Hugo.
Wait a minute.
Just a second.
I can't believe.
I didn't notice this before.
What?
With some black hair
and a busted nose...
this kid makes
a decent Frank.
What?
Yeah.
I know you're a little young...
but with that stubble and
a couple of missing teeth...
You have a Frank.
A bad Frank.
You make a better one.
You don't even know
if you need a Frank.
- I might.
- Please, no.
Listen, please, no.
I don't want any trouble.
- I fly! I fly!
- You a fairy?
No, no, no.
He has a pilot's license.
You don't want to fly
a commercial airline...
to San Diego
with all these heads.
That's how you got in this mess
in the first place.
He can fly us.
It's smarter.
Fly.
Grab all those heads.
Just leave the top one.
Why?
Bebause the top one
doesn't look like anybody...
and Big Sep will never buy it.
Wait just a minute.
I sawed this off,
and you're not even using it?
- Steve, chill.
- No, you chill.
It's not fair!
I spent a lot of time
on this head.
Don't you think
you could have told me this...
before I cut it off?
I saw that coming.
Don't ever fuck with a guy
looking for heads.
Good advice.
Now take all the heads,
and let's go.
Big Sep, it's Benny.
Where the hell are my heads?
I just talked to Tommy
a while ago.
He'll be there tomorrow.
First it was two weeks ago...
then three days ago.
I gave them to Tommy.
It's Tommy's deal now.
Don't talk to me about Tommy.
I trust Tommy.
This is your job.
Big Sep,
what are we talking about?
Heads. They got no value
on the open market.
It's not like
we're talking diamonds.
That's what's bothering me, Ben.
A guy pays 80 grand
and doesn't see proof...
he starts thinking...
maybe, just maybe,
he's been double-crossed.
You know what I mean?
Big Sep...
I swear on the soul
of my dead mother...
I offed them myself.
Me and Rico.
I give you my word.
Your word ain't what I paid you
80 fucking grand for.
I paid you 80 fucking grand
to see their fucking heads.
Now bring me their heads.
Benny! Benny!
Come in here! Hurry up!
You won't believe this.
Look at this.
- Oh, my God.
- That's Hugo and Stu.
Didn't I tell you
he'd screw up, Benny?
This is not good.
What the hell's
Big Sep gonna say, Benny?
Shut up!
Ernie Lipscomb, please pick up
the courtesy phone.
Ernie Lipscomb, please
pick up the courtesy phone.
This is Ernie Lipscomb.
It's Charlie.
Let me talk to him.
Sure. It's for you.
Yeah?
Hi. It's Charlie.
What? How could
you lose two more heads?
How could the police get them?
The one I lost earlier,
I got it back...
What are you looking at?
He's talking about potheads.
We're deprogrammers
with Marijuana Anonymous.
He hates to lose a client.
Listen to me,
you incompetent piece of shit.
Where are you exacly?
The La Purisima Hotel.
Don't move. Don't leave
your room for anything.
I'm coming down there.
If there's any more heads
missing...
I'll replace them
with your family and friends.
He really cares.
That's what makes him the best.
What?
I'm thinking that once
he gets these heads...
your dad's a goner.
We gotta move.
I saw a place
just outside of here.
We gotta check out of the hotel.
Come on. Get up.
I'll take these...
I had nowhere else
to put them.
I'll take these
to the American border.
I'll give them to the police.
I'll rent a bar
and drive all night.
What do I tell my mother?
Anything. We had a fight
and I called you fat.
It doesn't matter
what she thinks.
The important thing
is to save your dad.
I'm not fat.
Look, maybe your dad
was right about me.
I'm a total nimrod who can't
follow through on anything.
But I got him into this.
I promise you...
I'm going to get him out.
Get your hands off her,
you maniac.
You may want me
to think that I'm crazy...
but I'm not crazy or stupid.
You had those heads
hid in your room...
and then
you pinned them on my Dick!
Mom, what are you saying?
I'm calling the police on him.
Right now.
- No!
- No!
Mom, calling the police
is a bad idea.
Laurie, I love you.
Take your hand off the phone.
Back off.
I know exacly what I am doing.
You're not thinking clearly.
I'm thinking perfectly!
I know exacly what I'm doing.
Back off!
Operator?
I wasn't yelling at you.
Could you get me
the police, please?
Operator, I need you to get
the police for me.
I'm tring to reach the police.
Of course I'll hold.
I'm happy to hold.
For Christ's sake,
keep it down!
Hello, police.
Yes, I have...
Go. Charlie, hurry.
Go. Just go.
I need to rent a car.
Sure. That's no problem.
We got Chevys... Jeeps...
Chevys...
Hey...
That looks like our Jeep.
There's a lot of Jeeps, señor.
With this magazine in them?
I don't think so.
This Jeep was stolen from us.
I don't know, señor.
Lot of people read magazines.
On grand mal seizures?
You gotta be kidding me!
You really like that magazine?
Tell you what I'll do.
You rent this Jeep...
and I'll throw in
that magazine for nada.
Unbelievable.
Excuse me.
Where can we rent a car?
Make sure it has AgC.
Hold on, champ.
Are you telling me
I just passed out?
Drink up.
You're a little dehydrated.
You're such a mother.
I'll get us packed.
My butt's staying right here.
Why?
The Tropicana's wonderful.
It's a waste of money, honey.
Give me the two Cs.
A cot and a crapper,
I'm set.
Laurie, Charlie, it's Ernie.
- Jesus.
- Who the hell is Ernie?
Nobody, Grandma.
He sure as hell
seems to know you.
Is this some guy
you're boffing on the side?
Grandma!
What the hell
are you doing, honey?
- Where's Charlie?
- Who are you?
I asked you a question.
Where the fuck is Charlie?
And I asked you a question.
Who the fuck are you?
Now that we're in
this frigging La Purisima...
what do we do now?
We find the cop station,
and we get our heads.
All right.
Benny, look. It's him.
It's Tommy.
Come on. Get in there.
What the hell is he doing?
Think he got the heads
back already?
I don't know,
but why don't we follow him?
Come on.
Where the hell is he going?
Keep following him.
I told Charlie to stay put.
I told that son of a bitch
to stay put.
Who are you? God?
Why the hell
should he listen to you?
I am so groggy.
Do you mind
if I lie down in the back?
I don't give a shit what you do.
Just keep quiet.
Watch your language.
Fern, stop it!
Oh, my God!
Another head! Oh, my God!
Help! Help!
Lady, shut up!
I can't stand it!
I'm losing my mind!
Everwhere I look,
there are heads!
Shut up, lady!
Jesus Christ!
You're not the only person
on the planet with problems.
Shut it!
Jesus, what a head case!
That supposed to be a joke?
Killer humor?
Looked like this guy
I dated in high school.
Hugo Porto.
We better pull over.
We need gas.
Keep fucking driving.
Didn't I tell you
to watch your fucking language?
Where are you going?
Get your hands off me,
you goon.
Don't fuck with me!
Grandma!
My money says
he ain't got the heads.
Mine, too.
Whoa, man.
How could you do that?
- What?
- Throw her off the cliff!
A man can only take so much.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe you.
I thought the old battle-ax
would never die.
Mom!
He...
What do you want to do now?
Keep following them.
I don't like the smell of this.
Well, well, well...
if it isn't our old amigo.
No, not again.
Isn't once enough?
Can't you give a guy a break?
One human being to another.
Come on.
That's very moving, gringo...
but the real question is
are we going...
to cut off your cajones
or leave them on?
You don't have to do this.
Come on, guys.
Can't we flip for it?
What?
A coin? Flip a coin.
I win, you let me go.
You win... you mangle me.
You crazy man, gringo.
- Call it.
- Heads.
Whoa. You sure?
You don't even want
to think about it?
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.
Shit.
Juan! Don't take the keys!
Oh, God!
This has not been
a very good vacation.
Hello?
Hello?
Who's there?
Stop!
Not your kind of music?
I hate that shit.
Are you talking to me?
I said,
"Are you talking to me?"
I said,
"Are you talking to me?"
I don't know
who you're talking to.
I'm the only one here.
Shut the fuck up!
Are you talking to me?
Yeah, I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut it!
Screwball.
- What's that?
- What?
- Stop. Stop.
- Oh, no.
Hold on, now.
Hold on. Just... OK, OK.
Stop!
Don't shoot.
I thought
I told you to stay put.
Where's my heads?
They're in the Jeep
in the coolers.
- Good. Come on.
- I lost another one.
What?
Here, coyote.
What's he doing?
The kid ain't dead.
That's for sure.
Here, coyote.
Come on. Shit.
What?
- Shut up.
- What is it?
Shit. I'm dead.
It doesn't look like
they're coming after us.
Not yet.
Just the fact that
they're here means I'm dead.
When? As soon as
I give you the heads?
Or as soon as I get them
across to the States.
Knowing them,
they'll let me take that risk.
Who are the heads?
What?
None of your business.
What the hell do you care?
You spend your vacation
with a bunch of heads...
you want to know.
You think about
their hopes and dreams...
their lives cut short.
Hopes, dreams. Those bums.
You have to feel something.
You don't kill eight people
and not feel anything.
It don't really matter...
but let's
set the record straight.
I didn't whack them.
Those guys did.
Second,
Mr. Phi Beta Craphead...
if I hadn't fucked up,
I'd be retiring after this.
Hey. Look, look.
What the hell's he doing?
Looks like he's chasing
Aunt Philomena's dog.
What if we can help each other?
- Impossible.
- Why?
Bebause you're too stupid.
I'm not taking the chance
of going across that border.
If you know it all...
how come you're in this mess
to begin with?
Bad luck.
It's not my fault...
the bag was too big
to go in carry-on.
There was a gift shop
right next to the gate.
Did you ever think
of taking two bags?
Oh, shit.
I'll repeat the question.
What if there were
a way to help each other?
What way?
I'm not into mass murder
if I'm not paid for it...
but anybody gets in my way
is dead.
Thank you again
for getting rid of Fern.
Mom!
The going rate if five thou,
but you can owe me, lady.
Where the hell's he going?
Do I look like a mind reader?
Come on! Let's go!
Now what do we do?
Drive for the border?
Hell, no. We get those heads
and save your dad.
Hey! Come back here!
I'll kick your ass!
Come on, Benny.
Let's take him now.
I expect that's exacly
what he wants.
Let's see
how lucky we got here.
We got Marty.
We got Benito.
Little Joey.
- What is he doing?
- He's teasing us.
Wait a minute.
It's baught on my neck.
Jamal, you want to bite?
Let's see. What do I need?
I need
a Stu, Frank, and a Hugo.
There's Hugo.
- Who is it?
- It looks like Stu or Hugo.
Frankie. You suck.
You'll have to do, buddy.
How many's he got now?
He's got...
Seven, eight.
He's got all eight.
I want to make him
the ninth head.
And you...
You, I definitely don't need.
What a bunch of douche bags.
The lost dreams.
What a crock.
This coyote won't be
doing any more running away.
I got him trained.
That is disgusting.
I can't leave it outside
for the coyotes.
Everbody be still.
This is the last match.
Good work, Steve, you ass.
That's it.
Have to wait till dawn.
Steve, shut up.
Heads up!
Stop ahead.
Anybody need to use the head?
Shut up and go to sleep.
Don't let it go to your head.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You're way ahead of me.
Steve!
Don't bite my head off,
all right?
That's it.
I'm sleeping outside, guys.
Me, too.
Steve, get a grip.
Go to sleep.
Or what?
You'll have my head?
Enough.
Mr. Hit man
I'm so alone
Ain't got nobody
To call my own
Ain't got no legs
For walking all over
Can't hold my liquor
So I gotta stay sober
Mr. Hit man
Gimme a break
Tell Mr. Big Sep
That I ain't no snake
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Hit man, bring me a dream
Jesus.
- Wake up. He's up.
- Relax.
Damn it. This always
works on a Camaro.
You can do it.
All right!
Can I get some breakfast here?
Please sit anywhere you'd like.
What the hell's he doing?
I don't know.
Let's go find out, shall we?
- Coffee, señor?
- Yeah.
- Juice?
- Sure.
Look at this surprise.
Benny, Rico.
You boys decide
to take a vacation?
Yeah, Tommy.
We never seen Mexico.
We figured this'd be
a good time to check it out.
Good, good.
It's nice down here.
I know you're waiting for me
to cross over to the States...
but I gotta tell you now,
when I do...
you get that bag
over my dead body.
Funny. We was thinking
that exact same thing.
Yeah.
That's his van.
The guy with the van,
where is he?
He's in the hotel, señor.
You're not going after him,
are you?
We need those heads.
I'm going in there.
I can't believe
you're acually doing this.
Give me your guns.
Charlie,
where'd you get that?
Looks like mine.
It was yours.
You dropped it in the desert.
Now it's mine.
Both of you put
your guns on the table...
or I'll blow your heads off.
Right now!
Laurie, get the guns.
- Get the duffel bag.
- Wait a minute!
- Don't mess with these guys.
- He's right, Charlie.
What do you
want those heads for?
He'll take them to the border
and turn them in.
He'll be a hero
with her old man.
- Something like that.
- Forget about it.
You do that,
and Big Sep kills us all.
Fuck Big Sep.
Miss Bennett, Señor Pritchett.
Paco.
We're FBI.
He's the Una-Bellman.
Señora Bennett.
Back off.
Come on!
He's getting away.
Big Sep's gonna kill us.
Come on. Drive faster.
Why do you have a gun?
What?
- What's this all about?
- It's about heads.
Steve, leave him alone.
Did he say heads?
Look, look, heads.
It's OK, Paco.
I told you
it wasn't recyclable.
Paco, it's OK.
Charlie, what do we do?
Charlie?
What are you doing?
Ernie, give me the duffel bag.
Everbody stay in the car.
Steve, stay in the car!
- Move, please. Move!
- I need to get through.
Does this mean anything
to anybody?
I have something to declare.
Hey, his mistake.
He doesn't have anything.
Arrest them!
Arrest them!
That's his bag.
Arrest them.
Everbody freeze.
Don't do anything stupid...
and nothing stupid will happen.
Get to the plane.
Holy shit.
No need to be excited.
We'll get in the plane
and fly away. Bye-bye.
Have a nice day.
Arrest them!
Drop your guns,
or I'll shoot him.
Move in, damn it!
Arrest them! Open the bag!
There's...
there's a human head
in the bag.
The man you arrested
yesterday is in jail...
for the murders
these guys committed.
Her father's innocent.
These are the guys
that did it.
Right there.
Wait a minute.
That's not ours.
You arrested us
for the wrong head here.
- All our heads had hair.
- Shut up.
- Where are our heads?
- Shut up, Rico!
They set us up, Benny!
You knew it?
You planned it?
You got a future, kid.
Thanks.
"Sleight of Bag"

Show me the law about bringing
a head out of the country!
Shut up, Rico!
It ain't a fruit!
It ain't a vegetable!
It ain't a native plant,
God damn it!
You can't have it!
It's mine!
I spent a lot of time
on this head!
It's my best friend!
