Ana?
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
Wait, that's... that's not possible.
God, it's been 22 years.
You're not my sister.
Why did you leave Punia?
When the cardinal found
me on the streets...
it was my chance to escape this life.
Get an education, become something more.
I had to take it.
You said you would come back.
I did.
I tried.
I couldn't find you, I was...
I was too late.
I... I waited for you.
I'm so sorry, Ana.
I'm just glad you're back.
I won't leave you.
Ever again.
And you're sure
he's the best candidate?
The Office of Exorcism
has been a stain on our
faith for far too long.
I can think of no one more suited
to do the convincing
than Father Bennett.
Assuming he returns to us
with the proper... temperament.
And how are we doing tonight?
Fine, thank you.
You ask me, I think your
friend is gonna wake up soon.
Is that right?
I was in here earlier
and I'm pretty sure I heard
him talking in his sleep.
Praise the Lord.
Took you long enough.
Hello, Marcus.
== Re-synced by MaxPayne ==
Are you gonna talk to her,
or just keep brooding?
What's she even doing here?
She was at the house when I woke up.
I came with Bennett to find you.
I don't see him anywhere.
I left him in a hospital
outside of Spokane.
He was injured by your
friend, Maria Walters.
Is he all right?
You saw Maria?
Saw her die.
You're welcome, by the way.
Miserable creature.
Still doesn't answer my question.
Why are you here?
The Church has been compromised.
Every exorcist is being
recalled from the field.
They're hunting down the
ones that resist...
turning or killing them.
Not what I'm asking.
You, Mouse.
- Why are <i>you</i> here?
- I don't need permission
from you, or the Church.
You lost the right to tell me what to do
- when you walked out that door.
- You were in good hands.
I should have been in your hands.
I was in Hell, Marcus. For six months.
And you just left me there.
I fought to save you.
Day and night. Everything I had,
everything inside me, it wasn't enough.
I wasn't enough.
You needed help that
I wasn't fit to give.
I needed you.
I never
wanted this life for you.
We have no time for this.
You sent the kids off
the island to find help.
That means people will
come looking for us.
We'll do what we can in
the time we've got left.
What a lovely day for an exorcism.
Is there, like, some...
stupid Bible verse I
can say or something?
You mean, like a prayer?
Like whatever.
I just...
I need to do something.
You could start by asking God for help.
Does it matter if I don't...
exactly, totally believe?
No.
No, it doesn't matter.
<i>Whoever dwells in</i>
the shelter of the Most High
will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of the Lord,
"He is my refuge and my fortress,
- my God, in whom I trust."
- Surely He will save you...
from the fowler's snare and from
the deadly pestilence. He will
cover you with His feathers,
and under His wings
you will find refuge.
You will not fear the
terror of the night...
nor the arrow that flies by day!
Nor the pestilence that
stalks in the darkness,
nor the plague that destroys at midday.
A thousand
may fall at your side,
10,000 at your right hand,
but it will not come near you.
They will lift you
up in their hands...
so that you will not strike
your foot against a stone.
You will tread on the
lion and the cobra.
You will trample the great
lion and the serpent.
"Because he loves me," says the Lord.
"I will rescue him. I will protect him,
because he acknowledges my name."
He will call on me and I will answer him.
With long life, I will satisfy him,
and show him my salvation!
This one's strong.
We're running out of time.
How long until they find us?
Doesn't matter.
We keep working.
You're making a mistake.
What do you think's gonna
happen when the police show up?
Get yourself arrested
and the enemy wins.
I can't allow that.
Well, this is new.
- What are you doing?
- What you should have done
kill
the host, kill the demon.
You've lost him either way.
At least this way we save his soul.
Put the gun down.
Tell me I'm wrong.
We're exorcists...
not executioners.
I know a priest
in Chicago who would beg to differ.
Slit his throat from ear to ear.
What's he talking about?
It was an integrated demon,
it left me no other choice.
There's always a choice.
Every kill I've made,
every finger on the trigger,
every hand closing
around a little throat,
it all came down to that one choice.
That's what makes it all so tasty.
Don't listen to it.
I'm not.
You act like Brother
Simon was the first,
but his is not the face you
see when you close your eyes.
Where are yeh, Marky-boy?
I know you're in here.
My dad was a mad dog.
I did what needed to be done.
You tell yourself that.
But your mum were long dead,
and the door right there.
You could have run.
You could have gone for help.
You chose to take that gun off the wall.
That's why it haunts you.
Not because you regret it,
but because you enjoyed it.
It makes you wonder if
that violence in your heart
was always there.
Or if it gets passed from
one generation to the next.
You know something?
You're the first one
that ever got that right.
Lucky me.
My question is,
why is it still here?
It failed to kill the family,
it knows it can't beat all three of us,
so why hasn't it left?
Because of Andy.
He's trapping it inside the body,
holding it in place until we kill it.
So then we honor his last request.
Destroy the demon while
we still have a chance.
But you're talking about murder.
We don't have time to
finish the exorcism.
And Andy can't keep holding
that thing back forever.
- It will escape.
- There is another way.
We offer something it wants even more.
Bait.
Absolutely not.
The demon let me in once before.
The only way it's going
to release its hold on Andy
is if a better host comes along.
You've said it yourself...
There's no higher
prize than an exorcist.
You're talking about a suicide run.
I am talking about saving Andy.
Andy's still in there.
I saw him, I spoke with him.
Even if there's a
chance we can save him...
You let that thing inside your head,
you're not coming back out.
Even the slightest
chance, we have to take it.
You taught me that, Marcus.
We go to the ends of the
earth. We bring them back.
Nothing else matters.
It'll take your soul, Tomas.
It'll destroy you.
It was my fault Andy escaped.
It was my fault I let the demons in.
I need to make things right.
What, by throwing your life away?
My life belongs to God.
It has always been in His hands.
I don't want to lose you.
Then bring me back.
No, this is madness.
Just let him do it.
Tomas, stop. He's not worth it.
Don't listen to her, priest.
It's just you...
and me.
You can feel it, can't you?
Scratching at the back of your mind.
Like little claws, skritch, scratch.
Waiting to come in.
All you have to do is say the word.
You want me?
Come and get me.
Andy.
We have to hurry.
It won't be gone long,
it never is. Come on.
To the bedroom. The bedroom.
Every time I kill it, it
comes back a little stronger.
We're getting you out of here.
No.
I can't leave.
People are dead, Father.
Russ and Colleen, Harper's mom.
Because I brought this
thing into our lives.
I let it hurt Rose...
and the children.
How am I supposed to live with myself?
How can they ever forgive me?
You might be surprised.
If I leave...
the demon runs...
with some other family.
We have to kill it.
Father.
- If this goes wrong...
- No, no, no, it won't.
But if it does...
I want you to take back a message
for the kids.
Say what you have to say.
<i>You could have stopped him.</i>
You don't know my partner.
I know you're wasting his talent.
God sent you an atom bomb,
and you're trying to turn
him into a surgeon's scalpel.
Thing about bombs, they explode,
destroying themselves and
everything around them.
Only if we're not there to
protect him, show him the way.
What do you think I've been doing?
The old way doesn't
work anymore, Marcus.
How long does it take
to save a single soul?
Weeks. Months.
And in that time, the enemy
takes a hundred more hosts.
- I'm aware.
- Are you?
You asked me why I came.
I came because we're losing,
and I don't know what else to do.
And if there's a chance
that his gift can help turn
the tide, we need to take it.
I don't see anything.
You ever have one of those dreams
you feel like you can't wake up from?
That'd be nice, huh?
If this was all a dream?
Yeah.
Andy!
That won't work.
Andy.
I can't hold her back anymore.
- Andy.
- She's too strong.
You don't have to fight anymore.
It's my turn.
What do you mean?
If I offer myself to the demon,
it will let you go.
No.
That wasn't part of the deal.
I'm changing the deal.
Go home, Andy.
Be with your kids.
It's my...
mistake.
It's my responsibility.
No.
We cast you out...
every unclean spirit,
every satanic power...
every onslaught of
the infernal adversary.
driven from this good man.
From his soul, made in the
image and likeness of God,
and redeemed by the precious
blood of the divine lamb!
Any onslaught
of the infernal adversary.
We cast you out!
Father.
Hello, Father.
Let him go.
Take me instead.
With pleasure.
No!
Something's wrong.
Tomas. Tomas. Tomas!
Bloody Tomas, I need you to wake up.
Wake up!
Get out of there.
Tomas. Tomas, get out of there!
We're losing him.
Marcus!
If you can hear me, shoot her!
Shoot her now!
Tomas!
Do it.
Oh.
Oh.
Inside. Inside!
Over here.
There's nothing out here.
<i>I want to make one thing clear.</i>
<i>Andrew Kim was an amazing father.</i>
I've known him since college.
And whatever happened, whatever he did,
<i>it doesn't change the
fact that for six years,</i>
<i>he loved those kids with all his heart.</i>
<i>That isn't really
the issue, Miss Cooper.</i>
Four people are dead.
I've got a room full of
foster kids, all beat to hell,
claiming they were attacked
by their own father.
And you said that it
started with this, uh...
Lorraine Graeme.
That's right.
<i>She broke into the house</i>
<i>and she held a knife</i>
<i>to her own daughter's throat.</i>
<i>What Andy did was self-defense.</i>
<i>He disemboweled her.</i>
<i>He was protecting his family.</i>
<i>And the neighbors?</i>
Russ and Colleen Holstrom.
Was that also self-defense?
<i>Something happened to
Andy after he killed Lorraine.</i>
<i>And then when you tried
to take them off the island,</i>
<i>that's when he got</i>
violent against the children.
Yes.
Against you.
Yes.
But you didn't report the assault...
or the murder of Miss Graeme.
I was trapped on an island
with no power, no cell service,
chased by a disturbed individual,
with four traumatized kids
in need of medical attention.
I thought the paperwork could wait.
I have to say what you did...
took a lot of guts.
Those kids are alive because of you.
When can I see them?
What's gonna happen to us?
They're gonna put us in homes.
Together?
It doesn't matter where they send us.
We're still a family.
Okay, guys, they said we can go.
Thank you for watching them.
Of course.
Come on.
Rose. Um...
Before he died,
he gave me a message for the kids...
and for you.
What kind of message?
He said that every kiss was real.
From the party in college to the
first night Harper came to stay.
He should have told you how he felt,
what you meant to him,
but he hopes you knew it anyway.
What did he say?
He said tell the kids that...
Nikki and I loved them.
We loved them all so damn much.
Tell Truck, never
forget that he is smarter
and kinder
than anyone gives him credit for.
And just because sometimes
people don't see that
doesn't mean it's not true.
<i>Tell Harper,</i>
<i>don't let anyone tell you</i>
that anything's wrong with
you because you are perfect
<i>in every way.</i>
<i>And, um, even though you
weren't in my house for long,</i>
<i>you will always be my daughter.</i>
Caleb...
I am in awe of your courage
<i>and the fact that you
can still face the world</i>
<i>with a smile on your
face makes me love you...</i>
<i>all the more.</i>
<i>Shelby...</i>
I know...
you did everything you
could to protect our family.
<i>You were strong when I was weak</i>
and you were brave when it mattered.
<i>Ah, God, I'm so proud to call you my son.</i>
<i>And tell Verity...</i>
tell Verity that she changed
our lives when she came to stay.
<i>She saved us.</i>
Tell them that it doesn't
matter where you came from.
Every one of you is gonna
go to do amazing things
and live amazing lives.
And even though he may not
be there to see it happen,
you will always...
...always be a part of me.
Andy died
to stop the demon from
hurting anyone ever again.
I hope you know your father was a hero.
Yeah. We know.
Thank you.
Come on, guys.
How is he?
You should talk to him.
We can leave whenever you're ready.
I'm not going.
What?
You can't do this job
if you're compromised.
I learned that a long time ago.
I took a man's life.
I'm unworthy.
No.
Andy knew there was no coming back.
He wanted you to stop the
demon no matter the cost.
It's still murder.
Still a mortal sin.
Every sin can be forgiven.
There are rules in place for a reason.
We maintain purity,
we don't harm the innocent,
we put duty before self.
How many lives...
will be saved because
of Andy's sacrifice?
Because of what you did?
I don't regret pulling the trigger.
But I can't pretend it never happened.
It's been a long time since...
since I heard God's voice,
or... felt His touch.
And now, I don't feel anything at all.
How can I be a vessel for His
grace when, in that moment...
I rejected His love?
I was so close to saving him.
I could have done it.
But you'd have been lost.
It was a sacrifice I
was willing to make.
I wasn't.
Marcus, Marcus.
I, I...
I don't know how to do this without you.
You'll learn.
You're an exorcist.
You put your trust in God.
No one else.
Until the next time.
<i>Adios, hermano.</i>
Not forever.
Just for now.
For now.
You've come a long way...
little church mouse.
Keep an eye on him.
Don't let him drive.
He's rubbish at it.
I will.
Take care of yourself.
You, too.
Tomas.
It's-it's fine. Uh...
He does this sort of thing, yeah.
He'll come back.
I don't think so.
I cannot do this alone.
You don't have to.
If God brought you to Marcus
to help start your journey,
maybe he sent me to you
to help you finish it.
I believe in you, Tomas.
And I believe there's
more work to be done.
Will you help me?
You know, we're being hunted
by the single largest, richest,
and most powerful organization
in the history of mankind.
I'm not afraid.
I had a good teacher.
Am I allowed to hug her?
Yes.
You're allowed.
<i>I miss him.</i>
Me, too.
How are you holding up?
I can't sleep.
They don't turn the lights
off, and no one talks to me.
What if I told you,
I might have found a home for you?
It's temporary.
But maybe one day, it will be permanent.
Really?
<i>You have to promise me something.</i>
This is a brand-new foster parent.
Never done it before.
So you're gonna have to be
really patient with her, okay?
Okay.
So what do you think?
It's nice.
This is your house?
Would that be okay?
You know what I'm saying?
- Just don't hurt yourself, okay?
- I'm not.
Are you sure
you don't need any help?
'Cause you're gonna fall.
Dude, I got this.
Don't call me dude, bro.
Truck.
- Truck!
- Guys, I missed you.
Oh, oh, oh, no, ah, no.
Truck's just too big.
Okay, whoa.
Oh, God! I'm-I'm down.
- I missed you guys.
- Missed you, too.
- Ah.
- You got bigger.
I love you.
Slip 14, you'll see it.
You know, that's
what I don't understand.
- How you feeling, man?
- I'm ready to go home.
Hey, fellas. How's it going?
No catch for me...
Yes.
I can hear you.
I'm listening.
