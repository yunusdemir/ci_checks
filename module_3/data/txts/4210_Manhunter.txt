We should've talked
at the boatyard.
You don't wanna
talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself
to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in
the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit. Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore,
I understand.
Don't try to run
a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you
to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days
until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get
him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs
do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it,
guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire
down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be
his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away
from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you
before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only
look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me
or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have
to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me,
me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
OFFICER: I'll come inside with you,
if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe
you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up
in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies
of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen
sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored
to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong,
size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva
on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that
he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night,
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds'
throat as he was rising,
then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel
and lodged in her lumbar spine,
but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin
and marked increase
of free histamine level in gunshot wound
indicates she lived at least five minutes
after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains
on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight
because the intruder was moving
to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall
of master bedroom
and matted sliding marks on hall
carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark
around Mr. Leed's chest,
also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them
after they were dead?

VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now,
but if you'd like to leave a message
please do so after the beep,
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

When they were dead,
he smashed the mirrors and
began selecting pieces
that he would use
later on Mrs. Leeds.

Killing Mr. Leeds and the children
would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem,
four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
(SIGHS)
The smeared bloodstains
on the west wall...

(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
WILL: Molly?
MOLLY: Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford
for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch
her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg,
but there wasn't any talcum
powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of
a rubber glove
as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to
touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands,
and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off,
did you open all their eyes
so that they could see you?
JACK: Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the
Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears
they dusted everything,
and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane
in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds'
finger and toenails
and the corneas
of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore
surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report
didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took
his gloves off?
WILL: Because Mrs. Leeds
was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's
teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington
reconstructed these
from the impressions that
we took of the bite marks
on the Leeds woman here
and the Jacobi woman
in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has
pegged lateral incisors,
that's these teeth
here and here.
SPRINGFIELD:
Vice and Narcotics,
you take the K-Y cowboys
and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman,
heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments
are on the sheet. Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to
this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Well, I don't want to hear
that in public,
and I don't want to see
it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
(OFFICERS CHATTERING)
I know a burglar's gonna fence
what he stole
'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive,
so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't
even have motive.
None of us have shit,
and we know it.
WILL: It's in his dreams.
His motive?
WILL: Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying
that you're the one
who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs,
and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people,
didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator
at a hospital in Baltimore,
the other's in a private
mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists
say was wrong with Lecktor?
(SNICKERS)
The psychologists call him
a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you
pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it
in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat,
didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs,
but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD
a methane probe out of Washington,
have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the
kids buried it.
(PHONE RINGING)
SPRINGFIELD: Yeah?
OVER PHONE:
This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a
tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail
of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off
the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against
an eight-ball hemorrhage
from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification
off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed
and he's in my index.
I want to work these up
in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints
down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)
No comment.
JACK: If we get lucky
with that print, we're in,
if Jimmy can find
him in the index
and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor
case for the Tattler,
did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
(GROANS)
Keep the fuck away from me.
JACK: Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital
while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets,
and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me,
all right?
We only got three weeks left,
and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing
in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until
we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see
Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep
getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it. Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart? The one who
was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
(SNICKERS)
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly
clinical psychologists
from cornfield
universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article
on surgical addiction
in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me,
Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta
and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think
I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing
them, don't you?
I thought you might
have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see
if you're smarter than the person
I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're
smarter than me, since you caught me.
No. I know that
I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like
cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something
a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle,
doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with
appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either
do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working
on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them,
and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell
you what I think.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(PAGES FLIPPING)
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will,
if this pilgrim imagines he has
a relationship with the moon,
he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood
in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better
to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get
the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one,
I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files,
I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me. When I have to call
my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me
your home phone number?
No.
Do you know
how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can
leave messages for me.
LECKTOR: Do you know
how you caught me?
The reason you caught me,
Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.

WOMAN 3: Martha King's desk.
Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine &
Edwards publishing company,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy
of The Psychiatrist and the Law

Martha never sent me the address
and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal

I'd be immensely appreciative if you
could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy

CAPTAIN ON PA SYSTEM:
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are beginning our descent
into Birmingham.
WILL: You used a cutting tool on
the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling
and dreaming.
When night came,
you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down,
then you saw the lights go out,
one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down
and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
WILL: I need Firearms and Tool Marks
section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind
of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents
to fall on this carving.
JACK: Is it weird?
The mark? Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving,
I'll send it up to Langley.
WILL: Did Price get an identification
off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search. He's got half
his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
(SCOFFS) It's not on my
preferred reading list.
Well,
your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it? Lounds?
Of course. Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
GUARD: Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning
out Dr. Lecktor's cell,
he heard us coming and hid
something in a book.
We got him out of there
and dug around.
Is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
SECRETARY: Special Agent
Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham
right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford
is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very,
very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton,
it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham
on the line, too.
CHILTON: I have a note,
or two pieces of a note
that appears to be from that man
who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
WILL: Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted
that you've taken an interest in me.
"I know that you alone can
understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use
to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what
I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"I have a collection of your
press clippings.
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be
more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
It has teeth marks pressed into it
at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama
Air National Guard,
get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them
to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving
five minutes ago. You understand?
JACK: I have a Documents
team on its way to you
by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know
that we've found it,
he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
CHILTON: Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there
without him getting suspicious?
CHILTON: Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note
coming in on the flight,
possibly from the Tooth Fairy,
number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I
will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have
for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers
from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from
the security guard.
MAN: How many guys
handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.
But the others. . .
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print,
but can't guarantee the iodine
stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin? Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the
time you've got to get it back, Will.
BOWMAN: How long do I have?
JACK: Twenty minutes, max.
BOWMAN: The main thing to find out is,
how was Lecktor supposed
to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section,
because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.
This note was written
in ballpoint,
but it looks like Lecktor went over
this area with a felt-tip pen,
then tore it away.
You're so sly,
but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink
of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used
are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip
of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the
top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's
carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy
told Lecktor to reply to him
through the personal ad section of
the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there
right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication
between the Tooth Fairy
and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's
reply we plan to pull it,
substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy
will read. Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore
Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service
letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH: Not yet.
When do they go to press?
JACK: Thirty-five minutes.
Christ. Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size
of the hair
match the blond hair found
in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains,
dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated
cleanser with chlorine,
from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood,
but not enough to type.
(PHONE RINGING)
OVER PHONE: This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in
it being telexed to you right now.
Read it. "Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
JACK: Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your
safety.
"Find help in Galatians
6:11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
JACK: Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying
him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No. And our ad has to go out in
the same book code Lecktor used,
or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor
talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could
be the page number,
the paired numbers could be
line and letter.
But what book?
JACK: Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only
has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named
the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him
three years ago to find where
he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe
for potato chip dip.
JACK: Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a
book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd
read about Lecktor.
JACK: Willingham,
when he tossed his cell,
took Polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures
of Lecktor's books.
JACK: Where?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the
code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad
running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy
to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
JACK: And if Bowman still can't
figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something
else in next week's Tattler.
JACK: What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe. Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper
into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did
a real good job
of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go
through some big trauma,
you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making
moves. That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard. It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction
if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed
because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him
off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the
New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds
after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members
of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected,
though I'm not sure,
that he may have had sexual
relations with his mother.
(LAUGHS)
So, how long do you plan to stay
in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
LOUNDS: Can the Tattler rely on
getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect
your sex life?
Mine? It doesn't affect mine, it
affects yours. Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What? I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real
or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the
street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to
read it so he can find it,
but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch,
call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom. I need them on my
desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting
tool used on the severed branch
was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies
at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered
a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on
a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon."
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart,
he'll approach you from the front,
pass, turn,
try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms
.44 Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah. Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a
copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot
eight of eleven times?

I don't want to know who you are.
According to you,
I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.

Yes.

Freddie Lounds, your photograph.
No.
No what?
Not me, please.
Please.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming,
and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly,
tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others,
you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask,
I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
You will read this into the

Go.
"I have had a great privilege.
"I have seen with wonder and awe

"All I wrote about him were lies.

"Will Graham, you will learn
from my own lips
"how much you have to dread

"He will be more merciful to me

"You will lie awake in fear of what
the Red Dragon will do.
"I will be a testament to the
truth of this."

Bowman, just skip the cryptography and
tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that
Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home,
3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself. Kill them all."
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
Huh?
What time... What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
(WHISPERING) Mom. . .
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What? What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
OFFICER: Ma'am, I think you
should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please. I think you should
come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water,
check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone
with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler,
right?
I wanted to talk with him about it,
but he said he wanted to bring it up to you,
face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected,
you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
KEVIN: Is there anything I need
to know to see about Mom?
No.
KEVIN: This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital,
then I was transferred into the
psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said
it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls,
then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient,
and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination
like the killer had
so that I would know why he did
what he did,
because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office
and I looked up, I saw a book
on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down
the hall to call the police
and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me
in the hospital,
and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going
around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom,
asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better,
and I was okay again.
And the way
he thought felt that bad?
Kevin,
they're the ugliest thoughts
in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either
a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next
crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days
till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing
exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.

I'm sorry, too.

It's just you

I'm gonna find you,
God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you
there was a variation
in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen,
good. Good.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
REBA: Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
REBA: Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller
from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has
to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle
than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly. Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde
can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
RALPH: I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks. I'll order you 1200 feet
of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped
to shape up their employment practices
to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives
and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech
and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want
to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're
very direct, and I like that,
and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're
smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether
I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde
over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going
to cap his tooth.
REBA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's warm.
(HEART BEATING)
Back a little bit. There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You
rearrange the dead families into
an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will
make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use
the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you
dream you're becoming?
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
(THIS BIG HUSH PLAYING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me. . .
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside

And the light from you

The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

You know, if you show me where things are,
I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?I left my purse inside.
I'll get it. It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside,
it's... It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
(LAUGHING) Okay.
(SIGHS)
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh! Um...
We could meet at my house.
JACK OVER PHONE: You got the
message Lecktor called?
Yeah. I arranged for him to
have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good. Listen, we identified
the tire tracks left
when Lounds was delivered back
to the Tattler.
G-781 6 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
(PHONE RINGING)
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me
to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
LECKTOR: Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for
the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable
if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures,
they're issued to us,
along with our lungs and pancreas
and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed
after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs
to death?
I didn't know you then, but I
think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down,
was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad
because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34
of his worshippers
last Wednesday night in Texas
as they were groveling through a hymn
to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will,
because God has power.
And if one does what
God does enough times,
one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in
one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in ltaly last spring?
WILL: I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved
in the silver mirrors
of your eyes.

There's something about
this thing that dares me

this thing that haunts me

There's something about
this thing that taunts me

REBA: Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE: lt's me.
Who? Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE: It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No,
not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired,
so he changes people into beings
who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people
to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times,
one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get,
if our boy imitates being wanted
and desired enough times,
he believes
he will become one
who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid,
a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
JACK: What, are you sympathizing
with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult,
he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow
this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding
make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies
to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted
over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them,
we'll find him.
There is no connection
between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery,
he picked these women.
There's selection and design
in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by,
the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price,
the photographer,
anywhere he hits, we can be there
in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll. The scene
will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon
is happening tonight.
Give it up! Forget this month,
it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures
of two dead families,
knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine
families three, four, five and six. Right?
You're fucking right I did,
and I'd do it again!
Great! But don't talk
to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late
as I want to take it!
(WILL SIGHS)
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter
to trim away the branch
when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt
cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there
when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday
party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1
they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a
padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass
in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead
and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
JACK: We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi
stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause
you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar,
but you know it's the Leeds' dog,
don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again
anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar,
but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter
and every other goddamn thing
because everything with you is seeing,
isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake
that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors,
images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
(PHONE RINGING)
It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from
home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in
the document storage. Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab,
St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the
same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
JACK: Who processed the Jacobi film?
No. Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
JACK: Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in
three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and
a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
