Come in.
Mr. Spencer.
Mr. Spencer,
I hate to bother you,
but I thought
you'd like to know
there were two men here.
Two men asking for you,
a young man
and a kind of older man.
They was sorry
you wasn't in.
I said you wasn't.
Did they say
they'd be back?
They didn't say exactly,
but I think they will.
Just now,
when I had to go
down to the store,
I seen them
standing there
at the corner.
Maybe I should've let
them in, only you said
not to disturb you...
Yes?
And I'm sure
they'll be back.
You look
kind of tired to me,
and that's a fact.
You got a headache
or something?
I think maybe
you need a real rest.
That's what I think.
Why, Mr. Spencer, you
oughtn't to leave all that
money lying around like that.
Oh, it makes me nervous
to see money lying around.
Everybody in the world
ain't honest, you know.
Though I must say,
I haven't had much
trouble that way.
Those friends of yours
told me not to mention
they'd called.
Wanted to surprise you.
But I thought you'd
like to know somehow.
Yes, yes. Of course.
If they come back,
you may show them in.
Yes.
You know, Mrs. Martin,
it's very funny.
They aren't
exactly friends of mine.
They've never seen me.
That's odd, isn't it?
It is odd,
like you say.
And now that I'm here,
I'll have to meet them.
I may even go out
and meet them.
Then again, I may not.
Not yet.
You go ahead with your nap.
I'll pull down the blind.
What do you know?
You're bluffing.
You've nothing on me.
Hello, Postal Union?
I want to send a telegram
to Mrs. Joseph Newton
in Santa Rosa, California.
Here's the message.
Ready?
Lonesome for you all. Stop.
Am coming out to stay
with you awhile. Stop.
Will arrive Thursday,
and try and stop me.
Will wire
exact time later.
Love to you all,
and a kiss
for little Charlie
from her Uncle Charlie.
That's right.
That's the signature.
"Uncle Charlie."
That's right.
Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa, California.
Ann!
Ann, answer the telephone.
Newtons' residence.
Ann Newton speaking.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Henderson.
This is Ann.
Mother isn't home yet.
A telegram? Well...
I don't see a pencil,
so maybe she better
call you back.
I'm trying to keep
my mind free of things
that don't matter,
because I have so much
to keep on my mind.
Innumerable things.
I'll have her call back.
Thank you for calling.
Goodbye.
Hello, Ann.
Where's your mother?
She's out.
Out?
Mrs. Henderson just called
from the Postal Union Office.
She says
we have a telegram.
I would have taken it down,
only I couldn't find
a pencil. I looked.
Telegram, eh?
I knew there'd be trouble
if your Aunt Sarah got
her driver's license.
Whereabouts
was the accident?
I didn't take notes.
Oh. Then how about a kiss?
Isn't that
the funniest thing?
Here I am,
practically a child,
and I wouldn't read
the things you read.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I guess they'd
give you bad dreams.
Bad dreams?
You don't understand, Papa.
Mystery stories have done...
Where's Roger?
Out. The average mind...
Where's Charlie?
Out.
No, I mean she's upstairs
in her room thinking.
Well, don't read too much.
You'll ruin your eyes.
And leave my book alone.
What's that you're reading?
Ivanhoe.
Hmm?
Oh.
Who is it?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?
No. I'm perfectly well.
I've just been
thinking for hours,
and I've come
to the conclusion
that I give up.
I simply give up.
What are you
going to give up?
Have you ever stopped
to think that a family
should be the most
wonderful thing
in the world?
And that this family
has just gone to pieces?
We have?
Of course we have.
We just sort of go along
and nothing happens.
We're in a terrible rut.
It's been on my
mind for months.
What's going to be
our future?
Oh, come now, Charlie.
Things aren't as bad
as that.
The bank gave me
a raise last January.
Money.
How can you talk about money
when I'm talking about souls?
We eat and sleep,
and that's about all.
We don't even have
any real conversations.
We just talk.
And work.
Yes. Poor Mother.
She works like a dog.
Just like a dog.
Where is she?
She's out.
When she comes back,
it'll be the same thing.
Dinner, then dishes,
then bed.
I don't see
how she stands it.
You know, she's really
a wonderful woman.
I mean,
she's not just a mother.
And I think we ought to
do something for her.
Don't you think
we should?
Yeah. What were you
thinking of doing
for her?
Oh, nothing,
I suppose.
I guess we'll just have
to wait for a miracle
or something.
Oh, now, Charlie,
you're right.
Absolutely right.
I'll figure out
some way...
Oh, I don't believe in
good intentions anymore.
All I'm waiting for now
is a miracle.
Oh, Charlie.
Those back stairs
are steep.
What's the matter,
Charlie?
What's the matter, Joe?
Well, it seems that...
Oh, I've become
a nagging old maid.
And you went downtown in that
awful old hat you promised me
you'd throw away.
Mama.
Darling,
what does it matter
what hat I put on?
Mama.
Mother, I don't see why
you let that child
yell at you like that.
She's...
I'm going
downstairs anyway.
Joe, what were you
both talking about
when I came in?
Something
about a miracle?
Oh, it's nothing.
Charlie's a bit
under the weather.
Well,
she'll be all right.
Well, come on, dear.
Let's go downstairs.
No use standing here.
I'm going to get myself
a bottle of beer.
Mother, I'm going downtown
and send a telegram.
Why, darling,
who do you know
to send a telegram to?
I know a wonderful person
who'll come and shake us
all up.
Just the one
to save us.
Have you gone crazy?
What do you mean,
"Save us"?
All this time,
there's been one
right person to save us.
Mother, what's
Uncle Charlie's address?
Uncle Charlie?
Now, you're not
going to ask him
for money, are you?
Of course not.
That wouldn't help us.
What's his address?
Well, the last address...
Do you know
how many steps
I had to take
to get from here
to the drugstore
and back?
649.
No. If you've forgotten,
I'm not going to tell you.
I remember.
Philadelphia.
But, darling, you can't
ask a busy man like that
to come all this way
for nothing.
He'll come for me.
I'm named after him.
Besides,
we're the only relatives
he has in the world.
If you
come all the way up
Fourth Street, it's 802.
Mama, guess what?
I have no time
for guessing.
What's that thing
in your hair?
Well, I'll tell you anyway,
even though
I think it's nicer
when people guess.
Mrs. Henderson
said to call her at
the telegraph office,
'cause she says
we have a telegram.
Ann, I don't think
you ought to put things
behind your ears.
Something might get
into your ear.
Emmy, Ann says
we have a telegram.
I think you ought to
find out about it.
Somebody might be
sick or something.
Mrs. Henderson didn't
read the telegram...
Did you say
telegram for me?
...because I couldn't
find a pencil.
When I have
a house of my own,
it's going to be full of
well-sharpened pencils.
Did Mrs. Henderson say
who the telegram was from?
No, she didn't.
I think that's funny.
I think she might have
said who it was from.
Come on, Ann.
That's my chair.
I'll call up
and find out.
If you all be quiet...
Just a second.
Hello. 181, please.
I wonder who it can be.
Oh, nothing, Operator.
Just 181.
If that's
from my sister...
Hello?
Mrs. Henderson?
This is Emma Newton.
Ann says you have
a telegram for me.
Mama, you don't
have to shout.
Shh.
Really, Papa.
You'd think Mama had
never seen a phone.
She makes no allowance
for science.
She thinks she has
to cover the distance
by sheer lung power.
Why, how wonderful.
Thursday, you say?
Looks like
somebody's coming.
Who's coming, Ma?
Well, it's the most
wonderful surprise.
It's my brother,
you know.
My younger brother.
The baby.
Yes, of course,
a little spoiled.
You know how families
always spoil the youngest.
Well, it's just
simply wonderful.
Thanks most awfully,
Mrs. Henderson.
Well.
What do you think?
Charles is coming.
Who?
Who?
Your Uncle Charlie.
Did you say "Charles"?
And our Charlie's
gone to send him
a telegram.
Now, what made
her think to do that
at the same time?
And now Charlie's gone.
Hello, Charlie.
I just called up
your house.
Telegram for
your mother.
Did you?
Gonna send that
by Bill Forest,
but you can take it.
Thanks.
From your uncle,
it's the spoiled one.
My uncle?
My Uncle Charlie?
Yeah.
Mrs. Henderson,
do you believe
in telepathy?
Well, I ought to.
That's my business.
Oh, not telegraphy.
Mental telepathy.
Like... Well, suppose
you have a thought,
and suppose the thought
is about someone you're
in tune with.
And then across
thousands of miles,
that person knows
what you're thinking
about and answers you.
And it's all mental.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I only send telegrams
the normal way.
He heard me.
He heard me.
Mr. Otis? Mr. Otis?
Yes?
You're almost
in Santa Rosa.
Want to be ready
when you get
into Santa Rosa.
I'm ready now.
Thanks.
Then I'll get all your
bags out for you, then.
How you feeling,
Mr. Otis?
Pretty well.
A little weak,
but pretty well
on the whole.
Mmm-hmm.
Harry, tell the porter
you're a doctor.
Ask if there's
anything you can do.
Maybe you can help
that poor soul.
Listen,
I'm on my vacation.
Porter, my husband's
a doctor and
if there's anything...
No, ma'am.
He's a very sick man.
Won't see anyone.
I haven't set eyes on him
myself since we first got
on the train.
Well,
you don't look
very well either.
Here we are.
Come on, children.
Close the door, there.
That's right.
Oh, are you...
Charlie. Young Charlie.
At first, I didn't know you.
I thought you were sick.
Sick?
You aren't sick,
are you?
Look, Pop!
Here he is!
Why, Uncle Charlie,
you're not sick.
That was
the funniest thing.
Sick? Me, sick?
Well, Joe, how are you?
Haven't changed a bit.
All right, Charles.
You're looking great.
Roger. Hello, Ann.
I bet you don't
remember me.
I remember you sort of.
You look different.
Well, we better
get started.
Emma's got the dinner
almost ready.
I couldn't persuade her
to come to the station.
Dinner came first.
Come on, Roger,
get the bags.
All right, Charles,
I'll take that.
Thank you, Joe.
That's it. Come on.
Let's go.
Come on there, Roger,
and get these bags in.
Come on.
You sure that isn't
too heavy for you?
Oh, no.
It's nothing.
I love to carry.
Emma. Don't move.
Standing there,
you don't look like
Emma Newton.
You look like
Emma Spencer Oakley
of 46 Burnham Street,
St. Paul, Minnesota.
"The prettiest girl
on the block."
Charles!
Charlie.
Mama,
nobody got off the train
but Uncle Charlie.
Let me look at you.
We were the only ones
who met somebody.
There was only one
bed still made up.
To think you could
take the time off.
Oh, Charles,
it's so wonderful
to have you here.
Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.
And imagine your thinking
of 46 Burnham Street.
I haven't thought of
that funny old street
in years.
I keep remembering
those things.
All the old things.
Well, Emmy,
how's he look to you?
Same old Charles, eh?
Roger, Ann,
get these other bags.
You have
Charlie's room right here
at the head of the stairs.
Emmy wanted
to move Ann,
but Charlie thought
you'd be more
comfortable here.
Come on, Roger.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Don't put the hat
on the bed.
Superstitious, Joe?
No, but I don't believe
in inviting trouble.
It wasn't the biggest
yacht in the world,
but it had a nice little
fireplace in the library,
and the bar was paneled
in bleached mahogany.
You pushed a button and...
What am I talking about?
That's all over.
Let's talk about you.
Charlie, that's
the prettiest dress
I ever saw.
I think so, too.
Why, Charles,
don't you remember?
Remember?
Remember what?
Why, Uncle Charlie,
you sent it to me.
I did?
Well, say, I've been
sitting here all this time
forgetting something.
Ann. Roger.
Look at that.
Oh, dear now.
Joe.
Don't know whether
you had one or not.
You didn't have to
think of me, Charles.
Presents for
the children
are all right.
Say... I've never
had a wristwatch.
Fellows at the bank
will think
I'm quite a sport.
I have two for you, Emmy,
one old and one new.
Oh, Charles.
What is it?
You shouldn't have.
Really. No.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Charles.
Oh, how beautiful.
Oh, I've always
wanted one.
Oh, Mother,
it's exactly right.
It's what
you should have.
Look, Emmy.
Charles. You've
had these all along.
Mmm-hmm.
All along, Emmy.
All these years.
Safe in a deposit box.
No matter where I was.
Grandpa and Grandma?
1888.
Fifty-three years ago.
Aren't they sweet?
My, she was pretty.
Everybody was sweet
and pretty then, Charlie.
The whole world.
A wonderful world.
Not like the world today.
Not like the world now.
It was great
to be young then.
We're all happy now,
Uncle Charlie.
Look at us.
For once,
we're all happy
at the same time.
Now for your present,
Charlie.
Oh, I don't want anything.
Right now, I have enough.
Before you came,
I didn't think
I had anything,
but now I don't want
another thing.
She's crazy.
She doesn't mean it.
Really.
If you ask me,
I think she's putting on,
like girls in books.
The ones that say
they don't want anything
always get more in the end.
That's what
she's hoping.
She's not crazy.
The smartest girl
in her class at school.
Won the debate against
the East Richmond
High School single-handed.
She's got brains.
I meant it.
Please don't
give me anything.
Nothing?
Oh, I can't explain it.
But you came here,
and Mother's so happy and...
Oh, I'm glad that
she named me after you
and that she thinks
we're both alike.
I think we are, too.
I know it.
Oh, it would spoil things
if you should give me
anything.
You're a strange girl,
Charlie.
Why would it
spoil things?
Because we're not just
an uncle and a niece.
It's something else.
I know you.
I know that you don't tell
people a lot of things.
I don't either.
I have a feeling that
inside you somewhere,
there's something
nobody knows about.
Something nobody knows?
Something secret
and wonderful and...
I'll find it out.
It's not good
to find out
too much, Charlie.
But we're
sort of like twins.
Don't you see?
We have to know.
Give me your hand, Charlie.
Thank you.
You didn't even
look at it.
I don't have
to look at it.
No matter
what you gave me,
it'd be the same.
Here. Let me show you.
It's a good emerald.
A really good one.
Good emeralds are
the most beautiful
things in the world.
You've had something
engraved on it
that's different.
I haven't,
but I will
if you like it.
Yes, you have,
Uncle Charlie.
It's very faint.
"T.S. From B.M."
Why, it must be
someone's initials.
Well, I've been rooked.
The jeweler rooked me.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Really.
Give it back.
I'll have it taken off.
No, no.
I like it this way.
Someone else
was probably happy
with this ring.
Oh, it's perfect
the way it is.
You bring the coffee.
Sing at the table,
you'll marry
a crazy husband.
Superstitions have been
proved 100% wrong.
Yes, I've been thinking
of transferring some money
out here from the east.
I could put it
in your bank, Joe, until
I found out what's what.
I suppose your bank
does take money, huh?
That's
one thing we do, all right.
Rake in the dough.
Can't promise
to give it back.
Well, I think I'll go
downtown in the morning
and open an account at,
say, 30 or $40,000,
just to start
things off right?
That's a lot of money.
He won't have it long.
The government will get it.
The government gets...
You're not to
talk against the
government, Roger.
My goodness.
The way men do things.
I can't get that tune
out of my head.
Maybe if somebody
tells me what it is,
I'll forget it.
It's a waltz.
I know it is,
but what one?
You know,
it's the funniest thing.
Sometimes I get a tune
in my head like that and,
pretty soon,
I hear somebody else
humming it, too.
I think tunes jump
from head to head.
Do you know what it is,
Uncle Charlie?
No, no.
I don't know what it is.
I remember. Uh...
It's on the tip
of my tongue.
It's a waltz,
and it's Victor Herbert.
Victor Herbert
wasn't a waltz.
He was...
It's the Blue Danube waltz.
Oh, yes.
Of course it is.
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie.
I know what it is.
It's the Merry...
I'm terribly
sorry, Emmy.
Nothing to make
a fuss over.
Charles,
while we do the dishes,
why don't you come
in the living room
and stretch out on the sofa
and read the evening paper?
You never were
much on helping.
Joe, here's Herbert.
Ann, Roger.
Help me clear the table.
Herbert's a friend of Joe's.
They're literary critics.
Hello, Herb.
Had your supper?
Had mine an hour ago.
Hour ago, huh?
Oh, a watch.
Yeah. A present.
Herb, I'd like you to
meet my brother-in-law.
Charles,
this is Herb Hawkins.
Nice to know you,
Mr. Hawkins.
Fine, thank you.
How's your mother, Herb?
Oh, just middling.
Uh-huh.
Excuse me, Herb.
Thank you.
I'm sorry your
mother's not better.
Thank you, dear.
Oh, yeah.
There, now.
Thank you.
Lead a life of luxury.
Well, I must go and see
what Charlie's doing.
Wife's brother
from the east.
New York man.
Good for the children.
You know what I mean?
In business?
Well, he takes himself
very seriously.
Well, how's everything?
Say, have you
read this one? Huh?
That little Frenchman
beats them all.
You can talk all you like
about Sherlock Holmes.
That little Frenchman
beats them all.
I read it.
Air bubbles don't
necessarily kill a person.
Those writers
from the other side
get too fancy.
The best way to
commit a murder...
I know. I know.
Hit them on the head
with a blunt instrument.
Well, it's true,
isn't it? Listen.
If I wanted to
murder you tomorrow,
do you think
I'd waste my time
on fancy hypodermics?
Or on inee?
What's that?
Inee.
Indian arrow poison.
Listen. I'd find out if
you were alone, walk in,
hit you on the head
with a piece of lead pipe
or a loaded cane...
What'd be
the fun of that?
Where's your planning?
Where's your clues?
I don't want any clues.
I want to murder you.
What do I want
with clues?
Well, if you
haven't got any clues,
where's your book?
I'm not talking
about writing books.
I'm talking about
killing you!
If I was
going to kill you,
I wouldn't do
a dumb thing like
hitting you on the head.
First of all,
I don't like the
fingerprint angle.
Of course,
I could always
wear gloves,
press your hands
against the pipe
after you were dead,
and make you
look like a suicide.
Except it don't seem
hardly likely that you'd beat
yourself to death with a club.
I'd murder you
so it didn't
look like murder.
Oh, Ann?
What?
Come here.
Did you ever see a house
made out of newspapers?
Hold on.
You take
one sheet here.
Okay?
And you tear it down here.
And you tear it there.
And you fold it
over here, the side.
Fold over
the other side here.
And turn it up there.
Now the door.
Right off...
And there.
I'm not
a baby anymore.
Besides,
that's Papa's paper.
Oh, Roger, look
what we've got.
A nice,
little red barn.
You've got Papa's paper.
Oh, that's all right.
Simply unfold it.
Nobody will ever know
the difference.
What are you two doing?
You know that's your
father's paper.
Oh, it's my fault, Charlie.
I was showing them
a little game.
Didn't think about it
being Joe's paper.
Oh, that's all right.
Here's page one,
five, eight...
What'd you do with
page three and four?
We never touched it.
Really.
Uncle Charlie's the
only one that touched it.
Oh, well.
I guess it's all right.
If I fold it very neatly,
maybe he won't notice.
Come in.
I brought you water.
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
That's very thoughtful
of you.
Pleasant dreams.
Uncle Charlie,
I know a secret about you,
you don't think I know.
What secret?
Well, remember
I said you couldn't
hide anything from me
because I'd
find it out?
Well, now I know there was
something in the evening
paper about you.
About me
in the evening paper?
About you.
And that's why
you played that game
with Ann and Roger.
You didn't want us
to know and you wanted
to tear the paper.
Now I know.
You might as well tell me.
Well, you've
got me there, Charlie.
Only it wasn't about me.
It was about someone
I used to know.
There!
It's none of
your business.
Uncle Charlie,
you're hurting me.
Oh, Charlie.
Your hands.
Charlie, I didn't
mean to hurt you.
I was just fooling.
It was nothing.
Just some gossip.
Not very pretty about
someone I once met up with.
Not for you to read.
Forget it.
Good night,
young Charlie.
Good night,
Uncle Charlie.
Pleasant dreams.
How long is Uncle Charlie
going to stay here?
Forever, I hope.
Hasn't he got
a house of his own?
Not that
I mind you in here,
but I never
can tell when I'll
want some privacy.
You better go
to sleep, baby.
You said your prayers?
I forgot.
You better say them.
I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep...
Don't bless
too many people.
It's late.
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.
God bless Mama, Papa,
Captain Midnight,
Veronica Lake,
and the President
of the United States.
You can't say them
all tonight, dear.
Oh, and Uncle Charlie.
Amen.
All ready
for breakfast?
Oh, coffee. Emmy.
'Cause I don't know
how you do it.
Now, I'm never comfortable
eating in bed.
Of course, I've had to have
my meals in bed for a while
after the children came,
but I never liked it.
I can't face the world
in the morning.
I must have coffee
before I can speak.
Well, I don't mind
pampering you
your first morning,
but I think you're the only
person in this town to have
breakfast at 10:30.
And while
you were sleeping,
the newspaper called up
for an interview.
With me?
Mmm-hmm.
And the women's club
I belong to wants you to
give them a little talk.
Women's club.
Oh! Oh, you haven't
finished unpacking.
I'll do that for you.
Where's Charlie?
She's running around
the house as though
she'd lost her mind.
She thinks
everything needs fixing.
But what I wanted
to tell you was
that you are not the only
celebrity in this town.
The whole Newton family
is going to be
in the limelight.
What are you
cooking up?
Well, a young man
called this morning,
said his name was Graham,
and he wants to interview
everybody in this house.
Interview everybody?
That's what he said.
He's being sent
around the country
by some kind of institute
or committee or something.
He has to pick
representative
American families
and ask them questions.
It's a kind of a poll.
It's called the
National Public Survey.
Wonder how he happened
to pick this family?
Well, he said he wanted
a typical American family.
I told him we weren't
a typical American family.
Well, if he's going to
ask a lot of questions,
he can leave me out of it.
Oh, but you could tell him
so much more than
any of us could.
He's going to take
our pictures, too.
Pictures.
My.
Isn't that lovely?
You see, there were
really two young men.
One of them
takes the pictures.
Oh, there were two.
Yes. Mr. Graham
was the nicest.
Oh, he doesn't want us
to dress up or anything.
He just wants us to act
the way we always do.
Emmy, women are fools.
They'd fall for anything.
Why do you
let two strangers
come into your house
and turn the place
upside down?
Why expose the family
to a couple of snoopers?
You ought to have
better sense.
Why, Charles, I...
Good morning,
Uncle Charlie.
Good morning, Charlie.
Your mother's
been telling me
about the Newtons
being picked for
All-American suckers.
What do you know
about it?
Oh, Charlie wasn't
here when they came.
But really, Charles,
the way Mr. Graham
told it,
it wasn't like
snooping at all.
It was our duty
as citizens.
It's something
the government wants.
Government?
Maybe not exactly,
but it's for
the public good.
When I told them
about you and all
the places you've been,
he was really
interested.
Now, listen, Emmy.
I'll have nothing
to do with this.
I'm just a visitor here,
and my advice to you
is to slam the door
in his face.
Well, I couldn't do that.
But you don't
have to meet him
if you don't want to.
Well, I think I'd be
kind of exciting.
He'd take your photograph,
and then we could have it
for nothing.
No, thank you.
I've never been
photographed in my life,
and I don't
want to be.
Oh, Charles,
how can you
talk that way?
I had a photograph of you.
I gave it to Charlie.
I tell you,
there are none.
I guess you've
forgotten this one.
Get it, Charlie.
You sure
you don't remember?
Of course
I don't ever remember
being photographed.
46 Burnham Street.
Mmm-hmm.
It was taken
the Christmas
you got your bicycle.
Just before
your accident.
Uncle Charlie,
you were beautiful.
Wasn't he, though?
And such a quiet boy.
Always reading.
I always said
Papa never should've
bought you that bicycle.
You didn't know
how to handle it.
Charlie, he took it
right out on the icy road
and skidded
into a streetcar.
We thought he was
going to die.
I'm glad he didn't.
Well, he almost did.
He fractured his skull,
and he was laid up so long.
And then,
when he was getting well,
there was no holding him.
It was just as though
all the rest he had was,
well, too much for him,
and he had to get into
mischief to blow off steam.
He didn't do much
reading after that,
let me tell you.
It was taken the very day
he had his accident.
And then a few days later,
when the pictures came home,
how Mama cried.
She wondered
if he'd ever
look the same.
She wondered
if he'd ever
be the same.
What's the use of
looking backward?
What's the use
of looking ahead?
Today's the thing.
That's my philosophy.
Today.
Well, if today's the thing,
then you'd better finish
your breakfast
and get down to the bank
because Joe'll be waiting.
And, Charlie,
don't be late back
because the
questionnaire men
are coming at 4:00.
Good morning, Charlie.
Hello, Madge.
Good morning, Charlie.
Hello, Catherine.
Did you see the way
they looked at you?
I bet they wonder
who you are.
Oh, Uncle Charlie,
I love to walk with you.
I want everybody to see you.
There's Papa in that
window over there.
Hello, Joe.
Can you stop embezzling
a minute and give me
your attention?
Charles, we don't joke
about such things here.
Oh, what's a little
shortage in the books
at the end of the month?
Any good bank clerk
can cover up
a little shortage.
Isn't that right,
Charlie?
Uncle Charlie,
you're awful.
Everyone can hear you.
Good thing they can,
we all know what
banks are.
Look all right
to an outsider,
but no one knows
what goes on when
the doors are locked.
Can't fool me, though.
Well, Joe,
let's see your president.
Still want to open
that account, Charles?
That's why I'm here.
Well, you wait
right here,
and I'll see
if Mr. Greene's busy.
And, Charles,
he doesn't care much
for jokes about banks.
Well, $40,000 is no joke.
Not to him, I bet.
It's a joke to me.
The whole world's
a joke to me.
I'll be right back.
You shouldn't
tease Papa like that.
I wasn't teasing him.
I just hate this
stuffy atmosphere.
They're waving for us
to come in.
Hello, Mr. Greene.
Hello, Charlie.
Mr. Greene,
this is my brother-in-law,
Mr. Oakley.
How do you do?
How are you, Mr. Oakley?
Well, Mr. Greene, I was
thinking of settling
down here for awhile.
Great country.
Great country.
We think so.
What have you been
doing, Mr. Oakley?
Well, I suppose
you might call me
a promoter.
I've done a little bit
of everything.
The only trouble
I find is that
once I make the money,
I'm not interested in it.
Not interested in money?
You know as well as I do
there's plenty of money
lying around
waiting for somebody
to pick it up.
I thought maybe I'd put
some of my loose cash
away for safekeeping.
Naturally,
I thought of the bank
where Joe works.
Loose cash?
Well, I got in a habit
of carrying a lot of cash
with me when I was traveling.
A dangerous habit,
Mr. Oakley.
Never lost a penny
in my life, Mr. Greene.
I guess heaven takes care
of fools and scoundrels.
Yes.
Thirty, 35, 40...
$40,000.
Shall we start with 40?
If you'll just write out
a deposit slip, Mr. Oakley.
Ah, details.
I'm glad to see that
you're a man who understands
details, Mr. Greene.
They're most
important to me.
Most important.
All the little details.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
I didn't know
you were busy.
We can come back.
Come in,
now that you're here.
Come in.
Mrs. Greene,
I'd like you to meet
my uncle, Mr. Oakley.
Uncle Charlie,
this is Mrs. Greene
and Mrs. Potter.
Mrs. Greene,
Miss Potter.
Mrs. Potter.
Oh, and there was
something about you
that made me think that...
Yes?
What did you want,
Margaret?
Well, we were
going shopping
and I only have
five dollars, so I...
There's one good thing
in being a widow,
isn't there?
You don't have to ask
your husband for money.
Here you are.
Oh, thank you.
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.
Mrs. Potter.
Bye, Mrs. Greene.
There.
There you are, Mr. Greene.
Charlie, let's see the town
and have some lunch.
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.
Bye, Mr. Greene.
Call on us for
advice anytime.
Thank you.
Joe, you may see
Mr. Oakley to the door.
Joe, keep your eyes open.
You'll have his job
in a couple of years.
Here he is.
Those must be
the questionnaire men.
They're a whole hour early.
I won't see them.
Don't worry.
You don't have to
if you don't want to.
I'll see that you don't.
The way they got
around your mother.
I thought she'd have
better sense.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You must be the men
who want to interview us.
My name is Graham,
Miss Newton.
How do you do?
And this is Fred Saunders.
How do you do?
Won't you come in?
I'll call my mother.
Thank you.
Mother, the government men
are here.
Will you sit down?
But you said 4:00.
Nothing's ready now.
My husband is
still at the bank
and the house is...
That's all we want now,
Mrs. Newton.
Some pictures of the house.
Saunders can get busy,
and I'd like to
ask a few questions,
if you don't mind.
Well, all right,
but I do wish
you'd waited
until I had the house
looking its best.
I wanted to have
flowers around and fresh
curtains in the kitchen.
And there are a lot of
things I don't want you
to photograph.
I believe you told me
you owned the house?
Own it?
It owns us.
It seems to me
no sooner do I get
one thing fixed,
then something else
gets broken.
And then it needs
fresh paint and the...
Mr. Saunders,
I'm very sorry,
but you simply
cannot take a picture
with that chair in it.
It needs
a new slipcover.
And there are
six in your family?
Five.
Five? But...
Well, my uncle's
just visiting.
I told you about him.
He's here from the east
on a little visit.
Just put down five,
because my uncle doesn't
want to be bothered with
a lot of questions.
Well, you see,
on a survey,
we usually...
He's not
interested in the survey,
and I promised him
he wouldn't be bothered.
Well, we'd like it if
we could get all of you.
You know, your opinions,
what you do,
or what you want to do.
My uncle's opinions
aren't average,
and I'm afraid they
wouldn't help you a bit.
Besides, I think
when someone asks
for privacy,
they should have it.
Well, we'll...
The whole idea of
this thing is that...
Mr. Graham,
perhaps you'd better
choose another family.
We'll do anything
you say, of course,
but this family
seemed right and...
It is a nice family.
Charlie, why don't you
let the young men go ahead,
so long as they're here?
Well, all right.
Okay. Saunders, go ahead
and get another shot.
Mrs. Newton,
perhaps you could tell me
what clubs and organizations
you and your husband
belong to.
How about a picture
in the kitchen?
Well, I'm afraid
the kitchen isn't quite
the way I'd like it.
Come along.
Now, if you'll start
by breaking an egg,
Mrs. Newton.
Oh, but you don't
start a cake
by breaking an egg.
You have to put the butter
and sugar in first.
You see, after all,
survey or no survey,
I'm not going to start
by breaking an egg.
I thought I'd make
a maple cake.
My brother Charles
loves maple cake.
What does your brother do,
Mrs. Newton?
Oh, I guess he just
does about everything.
Oh, you mean,
what does he do?
Oh, he's just in business.
You know, the way men are.
My husband now,
he works in a bank,
but I think Charles
is just in business.
Mr. Saunders, if you
really want a picture
of me breaking an egg,
you'll have to wait
till I cream the butter
and sugar.
I'll wait.
I wonder if we could take
a look at the upstairs?
Could you show us,
and your mother can
call us when she's ready?
All right.
If you'd rather wait,
Mr. Saunders, you see,
folding in the eggs
has to be done just right.
I can't beat them
and let them stand.
The minute I hear
you've broken the eggs,
I'll come right down,
Mrs. Newton.
Yes.
I really don't see
what you want to
look up here for.
Whose room is that?
It's mine. My uncle's
using it now, though.
I'd like to get an idea
what your room looks like.
Typical girl,
typical room.
Typical of you to ask.
My uncle's resting.
I really don't want
to disturb him.
Is there a back stairs?
Mmm-hmm.
Right down the hall.
I'll bet you 50 cents
that your uncle
isn't in there.
Oh, betting's silly.
All you want to do
is photograph my room.
Doesn't he, Mr. Saunders?
That's it.
Besides, I know
my uncle's in there.
All right,
I'll still bet he isn't.
Let me knock and see.
I'll knock.
Uncle Charlie?
Uncle Charlie,
may we come in?
See?
You were right.
Nice room. Do you mind
if I take a picture or
two since he isn't here?
I certainly don't want
to disturb your uncle.
Oh, I suppose so.
But I really can't imagine
anyone being interested
in my room.
It's not at all
the way I'd like it.
I'd like to
have it all white.
Yellow and white.
Might as well let him
work in peace.
Besides, I'd like
to talk to you.
You know,
your picking us
as an average family
kind of gave me
a funny feeling.
What kind of
a funny feeling?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess I don't like
to be an average girl
in an average family.
Average families
are the best. Look at me.
I'm from an average family.
As average as ours?
Sure. Besides,
I don't think
you're average.
Oh, that's because
you seeing me now
instead of a few days ago.
I was in the dumps,
and then Uncle Charlie came
and everything changed.
But your mother said
he only got here
last night.
Maybe you just
think that...
I don't think.
I know.
It's funny,
but when I try to
think of how I feel,
I always come back
to Uncle Charlie.
Are you trying to tell me
I shouldn't think
he's so wonderful?
Oh, no. I...
Mr. Saunders?
I'm ready
with the eggs.
I hope Mr. Saunders
doesn't move
anything in there.
My uncle's awfully
neat and fussy.
Saunders is neat
and fussy, too.
Is this your uncle you
were telling us about?
Yes, it is.
Now, for one of the hall.
Mr. Saunders
has been taking
pictures of my room.
My sister told me to
remind you something
about eggs and a cake.
I don't like to be
photographed.
I'm afraid I'll have to
ask you for the film.
Oh, Uncle Charlie.
Give it to me, please.
Give it to him, Fred.
That's too bad.
There's a picture of
Mrs. Newton on this film.
Excuse me.
Mr. Saunders,
I'm ready to fold in
the eggs.
I can't let them
stand another minute.
That was
my last roll of film.
Oh.
Mr. Saunders took
Uncle Charlie's picture
by mistake,
and Uncle Charlie made him
give him back the roll.
I guess he wasn't joking
about not wanting to be
photographed.
We didn't want to
start a family feud.
I'll get you making
the cake again tomorrow,
Mrs. Newton.
Mr. Saunders,
I won't be making
a cake again tomorrow.
Now, I want to help
with an important work,
but I cannot go on
making cakes.
You have helped,
Mrs. Newton.
And now I'd like to ask
another favor.
Could I borrow
your daughter
for this evening?
I'd like to look
around the town
a little.
Ann?
Charlie.
Ann would be better.
Ann knows everything
about everybody.
Charlie.
Well, if Charlie
doesn't mind.
I don't mind.
Swell.
Good-bye, then,
Mrs. Newton.
Good-bye.
6:30?
6:30.
Okay. Good-bye.
Bye. Bye, Mr. Saunders.
Bye.
Good-bye.
He seems like
a nice young man.
But I thought you were
going to the movies
with Catherine.
Oh, I'll tell her
I don't feel well
or something.
Hello, Charlie.
Well... Hello, Catherine.
Hello, Shirley.
Hello.
This is Jack Graham.
He's in town.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Hello.
How's your throat,
Charlie?
Oh, much better.
Thank you.
Bill Forest was
asking about you.
Bill Forest?
Well, good-bye.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Bye.
I know what
you are, really.
You're a detective.
There's something the matter,
and you're a detective.
Charlie, listen.
I don't want to listen.
Why, you're not
on a survey at all.
You lied to us.
You lied to Mother.
You just wanted to get
in our house. Police.
That's what it is.
What do you want with us?
What are you doing around
here, lying to us?
Look, Charlie,
you've got to listen to me.
You've got to trust me.
When you've done
nothing but lie?
And you probably
didn't want to take me
out at all tonight,
the way
I thought you did.
You just wanted to ask me
a lot of questions.
Have I asked you
a lot of questions?
Have I?
All right,
I'm a detective.
A pretty bad one.
Now, won't you
even listen to me?
Why should I,
when you lied to me?
I had to.
When I came here to
this town to find a man,
I hadn't counted on you.
I hadn't counted
on your mother
or your family.
Find a man?
What man?
There's a man
loose in this country.
We're after him.
We don't know much about him.
We don't even know what
he looks like.
Charlie, think.
How much do you know
about your uncle?
Why, he's my mother's brother.
What's he got to do with it?
This man we want
may be your uncle.
Oh, I don't believe you.
Go away and leave me alone.
We're after one man.
Your uncle may be
that man.
We followed him,
we think he is.
But in the east,
there's another man
who's being hunted, too,
hunted through
Massachusetts
and into Maine.
He may be the man.
My uncle
hasn't done anything.
He knows it would
kill my mother
if he did.
He's her younger brother,
just like Roger is mine.
Why don't they arrest
that man in the east?
Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?
Charlie,
when we were eating tonight
and talking about our folks,
and what we'd done
and how we felt,
we were like two
ordinary people,
weren't we?
I mean, we both been
brought up about the same.
You liked me.
I know you did.
And I liked you.
It doesn't matter now.
What do you mean,
"It doesn't matter"?
It's the only thing
that does matter.
If it weren't for you,
you don't think I'd care
how or when I caught up
with your uncle, do you?
Because if he's the guy,
I'm going to catch up
with him, Charlie.
Remember that.
And you're going to
keep your mouth shut.
You're going to
keep your mouth shut
because you're a nice girl.
Because you're
such a nice girl that
you know you'd help me
if you knew your uncle
was the man we wanted.
I wouldn't help you.
And I know you would.
And I'm trying to
make it easier for you.
If your uncle's
the man we want,
we'll get him
out of town quietly.
We won't
arrest him here.
Arrest him here in town?
With Mother?
I'm trying to tell you
we won't.
Please, Charlie.
I won't say anything.
Oh, take me home!
Good night, Charlie.
It's going to be funny
when you find out
you're wrong.
Good night.
Hello, Charlie.
Home already?
Oh, yes, Dad.
It's so nice out,
I thought I'd get a breath
of air before I went to bed.
Well, you better
run in, now.
Your Uncle Charlie's
been asking about you.
I think I'll just
go up the back way.
I'm tired and I don't
feel like talking.
All right.
Suit yourself.
Take care of yourself.
Mmm-hmm.
Good night, Herb.
Good night, Charlie.
Good night, Charlie.
What were we saying, Herb?
Did I notice what?
Well, did you taste
anything funny
about that coffee you had
at my house this evening?
No. It tasted all right.
That's what I mean.
It wasn't all right.
Put something in it?
Put a little soda.
About the same amount
that I'd have used if
I'd wanted to use poison.
Well, you don't say.
I never tasted a thing.
Of course,
I might not
notice the soda.
You'd notice the soda
more than you would
the poison.
For all you knew,
you might just as
well be dead now.
Aren't you
asleep yet, Ann?
Mmm-mmm.
Charlotte,
what are you doing?
Oh, I'm just looking for
a recipe I thought I saw,
but it's just
so torn up...
They have papers
in the library.
New ones and old ones.
Miss Corcoran will
get them out for you.
She won't even notice
if you cut out
a little, bitty recipe.
Oh, it's not
that important.
What time does
the library close?
If you read as much as
you should, you'd know
it closes at 9:00.
Oh, well.
If I think about it,
maybe I'll go tomorrow.
You really ought
to go to sleep, Ann.
Get back there!
Get back! Get back!
Just a moment, Charlie.
What do you think
I am out here for?
Oh, I'm sorry,
Mr. Norton.
All right.
Go ahead.
Oh! Miss Corcoran,
please let me in!
Oh, please!
Oh, thank you.
Really, Charlie.
You know as well as I do
the library closes at 9:00.
If I make one exception,
I'll have to make
a thousand.
No, I'm sorry,
Mrs. Corcoran,
but there is
something in the paper
I've just got to see.
I'm surprised
at you, Charlie.
No consideration.
Oh, I'll only
be a minute.
You've got all day,
Charlie, to come here.
I don't know why
you want to rush in here
tonight like a madwoman.
I'll give you
just three minutes.
Can't be
anything really awful.
I'll prove to him it isn't.
Page three...
Hello.
Where's Charlie?
She's still asleep.
I don't want to wake her.
Charlie still asleep?
No, she just woke up.
Perhaps I shouldn't have
let her sleep so long,
but I think
she needed it.
She doesn't look
quite herself.
She'll be down
for dinner.
Mother, let me finish
mashing those.
I'll fix the rest of dinner
and get it all on the table.
All right.
You go on and talk
to Uncle Charlie.
How do you feel, darling?
I feel fine.
I must have been
tired or something.
I slept like a log.
Well, your Uncle Charlie
was asking for you again.
He's awfully
fond of you.
And that nice young man
came twice to ask after you.
I told him you were
asleep and I didn't
want to disturb you.
Well, I'm rested now
and ready for anything.
Is the gravy made?
Now you're
humming that waltz.
Whatever you do,
please don't hum
that tune anymore.
I've just got it
out of my head,
and I don't want it
started again.
Please remember,
don't hum that tune.
And don't keep getting up
every few minutes.
You just sit there
and be a real lady.
All right, if you say so,
but at least I can
carry in the soup.
Roger, wash your hands!
Joe. Charles. Dinner.
Mama.
What is it?
Ann, I told you not to put
things behind your ears
and don't pull at me.
And don't whisper.
When you whisper,
anyone could hear you
a block away.
May I sit by you
at the table?
By me?
Why, I should think
you'd want to sit by
your Uncle Charlie.
No, I want
to sit by you.
Why do you
want to change?
Mother, let her
change with Roger
if she wants to.
I asked Roger,
he doesn't mind.
No, certainly not.
Uncle Charlie
might think...
No, certainly not.
Mother, let her change
if she wants to.
Well, all right,
but Ann has too many
foolish ideas.
Go on, go in
the dining room,
both of you.
Well, what's going on here?
Have I lost my little girl?
Well, Roger wanted
to sit next to you
for a while,
and I thought
it would be nice if
the children took turns.
I never...
Never what, Roger?
Nothing.
Come, Ann. Come, dear.
Come and help me.
Joe!
Oh, I brought it in
by mistake.
Had it in my hand, I guess.
Nothing special in it.
Want to look
at the headlines,
Charles?
Thank you, Joe.
Roger,
don't make so much
noise with your soup.
If he holds his
lips close together,
he could
draw it carefully,
same as a horse.
Ann,
don't be disgusting.
Mom, may I
dip my bread in it?
Where's Charlie?
She wanted
to serve the dinner
tonight.
She'll be in
in a minute.
You're right, Joe.
Nothing special.
Nothing special tonight.
Oh, here she is!
Here's my girl.
I wonder how many
hours you slept.
If you could tell me
the exact minute
you went to sleep,
and the exact minute
that you woke up,
then tell me if you
woke up in between,
and how long
you stayed awake
each time you woke up,
then I could
tell you exactly...
You won't be able to
sleep tonight, Charlie.
Nobody who sleeps all day
can sleep all night, too.
I slept all right,
and I kept dreaming,
perfect nightmares
about you, Uncle Charlie.
Nightmares about me?
Uh-huh.
You were on a train,
and I had a feeling
you were running
away from something.
And when I saw
you on the train,
I felt terribly happy.
Why, Charlie, how could
you feel happy seeing
Uncle Charles on a train?
Goodness knows
I don't want to
see him on a train.
I hope
he stays here forever.
Well, he has to
leave sometime.
I mean, we all realize
he has to leave sometime.
We have to face
the facts.
I like people
who face facts.
Ann... Well, we're not
going to face any such
facts as those.
Oh, Ann, would you like
to see the funnies?
I'm too old for funnies.
I read two books a week.
I took a sacred oath
I would.
Besides, in this family,
no one's allowed to read
at the table.
It isn't polite.
Ann, don't correct
your elders!
She's right, Emmy.
I'm forgetting my manners.
Joe, I'm going to
blame this paper on you.
Roger, go to the kitchen,
look in the icebox,
and bring me
a big red bottle
you'll find there.
You can throw
the paper away.
Dad's read it,
you've read it.
We don't need
to play any games
with it tonight.
Ann, you can
help Charlie carry
in the vegetables.
I saw that bottle
when I was getting dinner.
You know what St. Paul said,
"Take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake."
Wine for dinner.
Sounds so gay!
Charles, remember the time
they had the champagne
when the oldest
Jones girl got married?
This is
Sparkling Burgundy.
Well, one sip and
I'll be calling it
"Sparkling Burgledy."
Maybe I'd
better not take any.
Oh, imported.
Charles.
Imported Frankie
and his tweeds?
And his loaded cane.
His loaded everything!
Roger, go to the cupboard
and get four of the small
glasses with stems.
Charles,
I promised Mrs. Greene,
the President of our club,
that you'd
talk to the ladies,
and she wants to know
what you're going to
talk about.
Well, what am I
going to talk about?
Lecturers usually give them
travel or current events,
don't they?
Oh, Charles,
not current events.
We get current events.
What sort of an
audience will it be?
Oh, women like myself.
Busy with our homes,
most of us.
Women keep busy
in towns like this.
The cities,
it's different.
The cities are full of
women, middle-aged widows,
husbands dead,
husbands who've
spent their lives
making fortunes,
working and working,
and then they die
and leave their money
to their wives,
their silly wives.
And what do the wives do,
these useless women?
You see them
in the hotels,
the best hotels
every day
by the thousands,
drinking the money,
eating the money,
losing the money
at bridge,
playing all day
and all night,
smelling of money.
Proud of their jewelry,
but of nothing else.
Horrible, faded,
fat, greedy women.
But they're alive!
They're human beings!
Are they?
Are they, Charlie?
Are they human,
or are they fat,
wheezing animals, huh?
And what happens to animals
when they get too fat
and too old?
Well, I seem to be
making my speech
right here.
Well, for heaven's sake,
don't talk about
women like that
in front of my club!
You'll be tarred
and feathered.
The idea.
And that
nice Mrs. Potter's
going to be there, too.
She was asking me
about you.
The Greenes are
bringing her here
to the little party
I'm having for you
after the lecture.
Joe, it's Herbert.
He always comes
when we're eating.
Good evening,
Mrs. Newton.
Good evening,
Mr. Oakley.
Good evening.
Well, Herb,
how's your mother?
Oh, she's just middling.
Had your dinner?
Oh, I had mine
an hour ago.
You folks are
getting pretty stylish,
having dinner later
every evening.
Joe.
Huh?
Joe, I picked
some mushrooms
before dinner.
You don't say.
Mushrooms mean
anything to you, Joe?
Well, I eat them on
my steak when I'm out
and the meat's not
good enough as it is.
Hey, if I brought
you some mushrooms,
would you eat them, Joe?
Suppose I would. Why?
Then I've got it.
You see?
The worst
I'd be accused of
would be manslaughter.
Doubt if I'd get that.
Accidental death,
pure and simple.
A basket of
good mushrooms,
and two or three
poisonous ones.
No, no.
Innocent party might
get the poisonous ones.
I thought of
something better
when I was shaving.
A bathtub.
Pull the legs out
from under you,
hold you down.
It's been done,
but it's still good.
Oh, what's the matter
with you two?
Do you always
have to talk about
killing people?
We're not talking
about killing people.
Herb's talking
about killing me,
and I'm talking
about killing him.
It's your father's way
of relaxing.
Can't he find some
other way to relax?
Can't we have
a little peace
and quiet here
without dragging in
poisons all the time?
Charlie!
She doesn't make sense
talking like that.
I'm worried about her.
Roger, go get her.
Bring her back.
I'll go. You stay here
and finish your dinner.
I'll catch up with her.
What's wrong with her?
Excuse me, Mr. Norton.
Well, well, you're always
running along the street
at night.
Say, where were you going
in such a hurry last night?
Just doing an errand.
Is this gentleman
your uncle I've heard
so much about, Charlie?
Yes, he is.
Uncle Charlie,
this is Mr. Norton.
Glad to know you.
What's the name?
Oakley. Charles Oakley.
Nice to meet you.
You better keep your eye
on your niece, Mr. Oakley.
I'll have to give her
a ticket for speeding
one of these nights.
City ordinance about
running along these
sidewalks.
Hear that, Charlie?
Don't want to
break the law.
I'll take care of her,
Mr. Norton.
All right.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's wrong?
I want to talk to you.
You're hurting
my arm again.
You're coming here
with me.
I can't.
I've never been
in a place like this.
Go on in.
Why'd you
bring me in here?
What does it matter
where we are?
Hello, Charlie. Hello.
Hello, Louise.
Uncle Charlie,
this is Louise Finch.
Hello.
Glad to meet you.
This is my uncle,
Louise.
I was in Charlie's class
in school.
I sure was surprised
to see you come in.
I never thought
I'd see you here.
I been here two weeks.
Lost my job
over at Kern's.
I've been in half
the restaurants in town.
What'll you have,
Charlie?
Nothing, thank you.
Bring her
some ginger ale.
I'll have
a double brandy.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, Charlie.
Well?
Think you know something,
don't you?
That young fellow
told you something.
Jack? Why should
he know anything
about you?
Now look, Charlie.
Something's come
between us.
I don't want
that to happen.
Why, we're old friends.
More than that.
We're like twins.
You said so yourself.
Don't touch me,
Uncle Charlie.
What did he tell you?
What did that boy
tell you?
He's got nothing
to do with it.
I hope he never knows
anything about you.
Charlie, you're a pretty
understanding sort of girl.
If you've heard
some little things
about me,
I guess you're a woman
of the world enough
to overlook them.
You're the head of
your family, Charlie.
Anyone can see that.
I'm not so old.
I've been chasing
around the globe
since I was 16.
I guess I've done some
pretty foolish things,
made some pretty
foolish mistakes.
Nothing serious.
Just foolish.
Oh, Charlie, now,
don't start
imagining things.
How could you
do such things?
You're my uncle.
My mother's brother.
We thought you were
the most wonderful
man in the world.
The most wonderful
and the best.
Charlie,
what do you know?
I'm sorry
I was so long.
We're awful busy.
Whose is it?
Ain't it beautiful?
I'd just die for
a ring like that.
Yes, sir, for a ring
like that, I'd just
about die.
I love jewelry,
real jewelry.
Notice I didn't
even have to ask
if it was real.
You can tell.
I can.
Bring me
another brandy.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You think
you know something,
don't you?
You think you're
the clever little girl
who knows something.
There's so much
you don't know.
So much.
What do you know,
really?
You're just an ordinary
little girl living in
an ordinary little town.
You wake up
every morning
of your life
and you know perfectly well
that there's nothing
in the world to trouble you.
You go through your
ordinary little day,
and at night,
you sleep your untroubled,
ordinary little sleep
filled with peaceful,
stupid dreams.
And I brought you
nightmares.
Or did I?
Or was it a silly,
inexpert little lie?
You live in a dream.
You're a sleepwalker,
blind.
How do you know
what the world is like?
Do you know the world
is a foul sty?
Do you know if you ripped
the fronts off houses,
you'd find swine?
The world's a hell.
What does it matter
what happens in it?
Wake up, Charlie.
Use your wits.
Learn something!
You going, Charlie?
Charlie,
will you help me?
Help you?
The same blood
flows through
our veins, Charlie.
A week ago,
I was at the end
of my rope.
Oh, I'm so tired, Charlie.
There's an end
to the running
a man can do.
You'll never know what
it's like to be so tired.
I was going to...
Well, then
I got the idea
of coming out here.
It's my last chance,
Charlie.
Give it to me.
Graham and
the other fellow,
they don't know.
There's a man in the east.
They suspect him, too.
And if they get him,
I'll...
Charlie, give me
this last chance.
Take your chance. Go!
I'll go, Charlie.
Just give me a few days.
Think of your mother.
It'll kill your mother.
Yes, it would
kill my mother.
Take your few days.
See that you get
away from here.
You realize
what it'll mean
if they get me?
The electric chair.
Charlie, you've
got to help me.
I count on you.
You said yourself
we're no ordinary
uncle and niece,
no matter
what I've done.
You go in.
I'll be in
in a minute.
East, west, home's best.
Where's Charlie?
She's outside.
Don't worry about her.
Well, what was
the matter with her?
She said
she was a little edgy.
I persuaded her to go
for a little walk.
She's calmed down now.
Oh, I'm so glad.
I've saved a dessert
for you, Charles.
Oh, thank you, Emmy.
We had an ice cream soda
downtown.
Oopsy-daisy!
Now, off to bed you go!
Off you go.
Good night, you all.
No!
Roger, come here!
No.
Come here!
There's my girl. Psst.
Ann.
Ann.
Hello!
You must be trying
to hide or something.
We're not hiding.
Well, you said, "Psst."
People who are
hiding always
say, "Psst."
We just don't want
to yell on Sunday.
Look, Ann.
Ask your sister to run
over here for a minute.
Don't noise it around.
Just ask her quietly.
We'll wait here.
Did my father
and your father
have a feud?
My father?
Because if they didn't,
there's no sense
in my asking
Charlotte quietly.
Mama won't care.
She thinks girls
ought to marry
and settle down.
In a book I'm reading...
Just ask her, Ann.
Don't be literary.
All right.
Remember, I'm doing
all the talking.
Hello.
Hello. Hello, Catherine.
Good morning,
Mr. Graham.
Well, Catherine,
this is Mr. Saunders.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Ann says
you want to
speak to me.
Saunders wants
to speak to you.
Come on, Ann.
Tell Catherine
the story of Dracula.
Come on, Catherine.
What do you want?
Let them get
a little bit ahead.
I want to tell you about
that photograph we took.
The one of your uncle?
You gave it back to him.
He probably burned it.
Not that one,
he hasn't.
We gave him
the wrong film.
Yes, we got
the picture all right.
We wired it east.
They've got
witnesses in the east
who can identify
the man we want
from that picture.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean,
identify him?
Just what I said.
The minute
the witnesses
see that picture,
we'll know
whether or not
Oakley's the man.
We're waiting
for the wire now.
And then
Uncle Charlie will be...
That's right.
That's the way it is.
Graham thought perhaps
you could get your uncle
to leave town now,
or within
a couple of hours.
It could be better for...
I've got to, haven't I?
I've got to!
What's the most time
you'll give me?
Say, two hours.
I'll make him leave!
I'll make him.
You seem pretty sure
he's the man we want. Why?
Why? No reason why.
I'm just scared.
You're the ones
who seem sure.
It's just that I can't
stand for anything to
happen here.
You know what he's done,
don't you?
No, I don't want to hear!
Well, I want you
to get this.
We're really
doing you a favor.
You've had a bad break,
but if you know anything
more about your uncle
than you've
already told us,
let's have it!
We also want to know
when he leaves town
and how he leaves town.
If you hold out on us...
I won't. I'll tell you.
Step on a crack,
you'll break your
mother's back.
I wish I knew
we could trust you.
I won't do
anything to help him,
I promise.
But you can't ask me
to spy on him and
come running to you.
We've made a bargain.
I'll get him to leave.
That's all I'll do.
I'll get him to leave.
Think, Charlie, think.
The man's dangerous.
If he gets away
from us, he'll...
I don't want to hear
what he'll do.
We've made a bargain now.
I'll keep it.
I'll let you know
when he leaves.
Funny if he turned out
to be the wrong man.
Could be.
Ann.
I broke my
mother's back
three times.
Not bad.
Say, Ann, you didn't finish
telling me whether Miss Rose
married the rich guy,
or the one
she was in love with.
Well, how long
have you two been
so friendly?
Oh, we play a game.
I ask questions,
and she knows
all the answers.
The only trouble is,
I can't make out
what she knows and
what she's making up.
I never
make up anything.
I get everything
from my books.
They're all true.
Come on, Ann.
We'd better get home
and help with dinner.
Good-bye, Mr. Saunders.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Graham.
Mr. Saunders.
Good-bye, Catherine.
Come on, Catherine.
Ann, why don't you
pick some flowers
for the dinner table?
Simple flowers
are the best.
I didn't ask
for orchids.
I wish I'd been
born in the South.
Southern women
have a lot of charm.
They pick flowers
with gloves on.
Good-bye, Catherine.
Good-bye, Charlie.
See you after dinner.
All right. Bye.
Hello, Ann.
Hello.
How was church, Charlie?
Did you count the house?
Turn anybody away?
No, room enough
for everyone.
I'm glad to hear that.
Show's been running
such a long time,
I thought maybe
attendance might be
falling off.
Anything special on
the noon broadcast?
A fellow said
they caught
that other fellow,
the one they call
the Merry Widow Murderer.
They did, did they?
Where?
State of Maine.
Portland.
Didn't catch him exactly.
He was running away
from the police,
and they were just about
to nab him at the airport,
and he ran plunk
right into the propeller
of an airplane.
Ooh, boy!
Cut him all to pieces.
Had to identify him
by his clothes.
His shirts were
all initialed,
"C. O'H."
Well, makes a good ending.
Couldn't have done better
myself.
I guess that closes
that case pretty final.
Sure does.
Never cared much
for that case.
Well, I think I'll go up
and get ready for dinner.
I'm hungry. I can eat
a good dinner today.
Charlie, I have
great news for you.
Where can we
talk alone?
Well, we got a wire
from Maine, so we can
call off the job.
I'll bet
you're relieved.
Believe me, I am.
Oh, I am relieved.
Here you were
trying to get
your uncle out of town.
He must have thought
you were crazy.
Jack, now that it's over,
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.
I'd like to pretend
the whole dreadful
thing never happened.
There's nothing
to pretend about.
There's mother's gloves.
Mother and her gloves.
She's always losing things.
All mothers
lose things.
Someday,
she'll be losing you.
Mothers don't
lose daughters,
don't you remember?
They gain sons.
That's right. But gain
isn't always the word.
Now take me.
Who'd want a detective
for a son-in-law?
My father would.
He would?
You mean to say that
if you walked up
to him and said,
"Father, I'm going
to marry a detective,"
he wouldn't disown you?
It wouldn't
have to be me.
There's Ann.
No. Ann wants to
marry a librarian.
She told me.
So she'll always have
plenty of books around
to read.
What's the matter?
I was laughing.
It's been so long
since I laughed.
I like it
when you laugh.
I like it
when you don't.
I guess I like you
whatever you do.
I guess I like you.
I'm glad.
I like you, too.
Funny how you happen
to meet someone and
like them and like them.
Charlie?
Yes?
I suppose it couldn't ever
really happen someday that
you'd tell
your father...
You know,
about marrying someone.
A detective, I mean.
I don't know.
I didn't mean
to tell you.
I wanted to wait until
you'd forgotten all the mess
we've been through together,
till you could stop
thinking of me
as a part of something
unpleasant and frightening.
I wanted to
wait and come back,
and then tell you.
But I can't help it.
I want to tell you now.
I love you, Charlie.
I love you terribly.
I know it's no time
to tell you now,
and I'm sorry.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Do you think you could
think about it?
About your loving me?
And perhaps
your loving me.
I'd like us
to be friends.
I know that.
We are friends.
I'd like to have that
to think about.
Nothing more?
I don't know, Jack.
I just don't know yet.
All right.
But I may come back?
Oh, please come back.
Please come back.
Listen, Charlie.
When I go away, will you
go back to that square
in the middle of the town
and take
a good look at it?
'Cause that's where
I first knew I loved you.
That's where
we had the fight.
I didn't know
what to do.
I like my job,
but I didn't
like it that night.
I hated it
that night.
You hate it now?
No, not now.
You know,
this is a swell place.
I'm going to put
a bronze plaque
right up there.
That door's always
banging shut!
Oh, it's...
Oh!
What are you two
locking yourselves
in the garage for?
When I was young,
we sat in the parlor.
Hello, Mr. Oakley.
I was saying good-bye
to Charlie.
In the garage?
In the garage,
and the door
got stuck.
Well, now I'll have
to say good-bye to you.
Well, let's say good-bye
right out here on the lawn.
No use taking a chance
on the garage, again.
Finished here?
All finished,
but I'll be back.
You'll be
seeing me around.
Oh?
Not on business,
though.
I can understand
you coming back.
Charlie's a fine girl.
She's the thing
I love most
in the world.
I mean it.
Have a nice trip,
Mr. Graham.
And don't take
any more photographs
without permission.
Rights of man.
You know, freedom?
We'll have
a talk about freedom
some day, Mr. Oakley.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Don't forget to write.
Remember, you have
all the addresses.
Mmm-hmm.
Jack!
Anything else?
I've got butter,
fruit, green thread,
and go to the library.
And whatever
vegetable looks freshest.
If I've forgotten anything,
I'll send Ann later.
All right.
Mother!
Charlie! Darling!
Are you hurt?
I tripped.
Oh, what is it?
Is it your ankle?
I don't think I'm hurt.
I grabbed the banister.
Oh, darling.
You might have been killed!
I worry myself sick
every time
one of you children
come down these stairs.
They're too steep
and rickety.
They ought
to be fixed.
Are you sure
you're all right?
When are you leaving,
Uncle Charlie?
Oh, come now, Charlie.
That other business,
it's all over.
I'd like to forget it.
We're all happy here.
When are you leaving?
I'm not going,
you see.
Not yet.
I'm not going.
I want to settle down.
Live in a place
where people know me,
have some money in the bank.
Some sort of business.
Be a part of this family.
I see.
And the most sensible
thing for you to do is
to be friends with me.
I can do a lot
for you, Charlie.
A lot for all of you.
No, not you.
We don't want
anything from you.
I wish I'd told
my mother about you.
I wish I had.
I know what
you've been thinking.
How do you think
your mother
would have felt?
What would it
do to her now?
How about your father?
His job at the bank?
What would
become of all of you
if everything came out?
I know.
You needn't be afraid.
I can't tell them.
But I'm not
afraid, Charlie.
What would you tell?
Who'd believe you?
A waltz runs
through your head.
You don't like
the initials on a ring,
and you connect it all up
with a newspaper clipping.
And now, you haven't
even got the ring.
I don't know
what became of it.
You have it.
I? I gave it to you.
I don't want you here,
Uncle Charlie.
I don't want you
to touch my mother.
So go away,
I'm warning you.
Go away,
or I'll kill you myself.
See? That's the way
I feel about you.
Here you are, Joe.
Oh, perfume.
Just the nice, fresh,
clean smell of lavender.
Yeah, I know.
You look very handsome,
both of you.
I must say,
I'm pretty proud of
the two men in my family.
Emmy, you're a dream.
It's a shame
the children have
to sit on our laps.
Yeah, it's going
to be a tight squeeze
for everybody.
It won't do
my pants any good.
Oh, Joe,
I wish you could
drive the car.
Well,
we do it this way.
Charles, you'll sit...
Mother, Uncle Charlie
can sit in back with Dad,
and the children can
fit in perfectly well
beside them.
Nonsense.
I'm getting a cab.
You all go in the taxi,
and Charlie
and I'll go in the car.
No, Uncle Charlie,
you go in the taxi.
I want to ride
in the taxi!
Course you do.
So it's all arranged.
Charlie,
you run out to the garage
and get the car.
I'd much rather
drive the family.
Charlie, I want you
to hear my speech
on the way.
After all,
you're my severest
critic, you know.
Well, anyway,
we need a taxi.
Ann, go and call
Mr. Abercrombie.
Mother!
Mother,
please ride with me.
Father can
take the children.
Please!
You know, I'll bet
I'll be the only man there
outside of Charles
fool enough to
dress up like this.
Then you'll be
the only other one
to be correct.
You look
very distinguished.
Charles,
are you all ready?
Joe, are you?
No.
Wait a minute!
I've got to
get my overcoat.
Oh, Joe. Well,
please, dear. Hurry!
Take your time, Emmy.
They can't start
till I get there.
It's getting
chilly in here.
KSRO, Santa Rosa,
with studios in Vallejo
and Santa Rosa, California.
KSRO now
brings you the...
May as well have
a little music
while we wait.
Oregon State Police pressed
their search today for five...
Oh! Does it have
to be so loud?
Gets the lower tones
better.
I like it loud!
If music's too soft,
I can't tell
what they're playing.
If I have a band,
I'll at least have
87 men.
Help, everybody!
Somebody's caught
in the garage.
They're suffocating!
There's something
the matter with the door.
Joe!
I'll take her.
I've got her.
Joe, there's a bottle
of whiskey on my bureau.
Get it quick.
Charlie. Charlie.
Dear Charlie.
Charlie?
Emmy, rub her feet.
Roger, run
and get something
to fan her with.
Charlie!
Ann, don't, dear.
Charlie? What are you
trying to say, Charlie?
Go away.
Emmy, she wants you.
I'm here, darling.
Here's mother.
That's right, my baby.
That's right,
my brave little girl.
Here...
Take a little
sip of this.
No, I'm all right.
Joe, call Dr. Phillips.
No, please, Dad.
I'm all right.
I just want to get up.
You had a wonderful
escape, Charlie.
Someone must have
left the motor running.
I couldn't
find the key
to turn it off.
The key was there
when I went in.
Lucky thing
I passed by.
She might have died.
You saved her.
You kept your head.
You knew just what to do.
Don't know
how I happened to
come across that way.
We'll put the lecture off.
There isn't going to be
any lecture.
Oh, yes, there is.
I want you all to go.
There's the cab now.
Go on, all of you.
Oh, I couldn't.
I just couldn't go.
Who found me
in the garage?
Herb heard you
beating on the door.
I was coming
across the backyard,
and I heard this gasping
and beating on the door,
and I figured there must be
a human being in there.
Quick thinking, Herb.
Lucky thing.
I'm glad you happened
to be going by, Herb.
Come on, Mother.
I want to stay with you.
Well, I don't feel
much like making
a speech now,
when I think what
might have happened
to you, Charlie.
I'm all right.
I just want to sit
on the porch awhile
and get the air.
No, darling,
I won't hear of it.
Mother, I'm all right,
really.
I could go
to the lecture,
but I'd rather stay home
and get things ready
for the party.
Darling, I want
to stay with you.
Herb, will you take Roger?
Ann, you come with us.
I just don't understand it.
First the stairs and...
Mr. Graham
isn't there?
This is the Hotel Stewart
in Fresno, isn't it?
And you don't
expect him?
I see. Thank you.
He isn't there?
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Can you tell me
where I can reach him?
I've already tried to
get him at the address
he gave me in Fresno.
Thank you.
Mom, may we have
some sandwiches?
Oh, but don't take
anything from
the dining room.
Go in the kitchen.
Please go in.
And just leave
your coats out...
Joe, dear, will you
take care of everyone?
Charlie!
I'll be right down.
Well, now...
Now, now, Mr. Oakley.
I thought champagne
was only for battleships.
None for me, thanks,
and none, I'm sure,
for my wife.
But we hope
you'll all forget
we're here.
I'd like to propose
a toast to...
Isn't Charlie
coming down?
She'll be down
in a moment.
Mrs. Potter.
Don't take that one.
I don't know
why I make tomato.
They always soak
through the bread when
they've been standing.
Try one of these.
It's just
whole wheat bread
and cream cheese.
It's the paprika
makes it pink.
Mr. Greene.
Mrs. Greene,
what would you like?
Thank you.
I think I'd like to
propose a toast, too.
Emmy.
To our
distinguished visitor,
the man who's made
the best speech heard
in this town for years.
To that very good fellow,
Mr. Oakley.
Thank you, sir.
Herbie.
Thank you.
We don't get
many American speakers,
Mr. Oakley.
Seems like foreigners
make the best talkers.
Here she is.
Now for my toast.
Charlie,
you're just in time
for a farewell toast.
I hate to break
the news to you
like this,
but tomorrow
I must leave
Santa Rosa.
Not forever.
Not forever.
If that isn't the
strangest coincidence.
Why, I was planning
to go to San Francisco
myself tomorrow morning.
Charles.
Oh, Emmy darling,
I didn't mean to spoil
your fun tonight.
I got a letter today.
I have to catch
the early morning train.
I'll miss you, Emmy.
But I want you all to know
that I'll always think of
this lovely town
as a place of hospitality
and kindness,
and homes... Homes.
But I can't bear it
if you go, Charles.
Oh, Emmy,
I'll be back.
I've arranged with
Dr. Phillips for our little
memorial for the children.
I know.
It isn't any
of the things
you've done.
It's just the idea that
we were together again.
I'm sorry!
But, you see,
we were so close
growing up.
And then Charles went away,
and I got married, and...
Then you know
how it is.
You sort of forget
you're you.
You're your
husband's wife...
We'll be looking
for you, Mr. Oakley.
We feel you're one of us,
don't we, Margaret?
Indeed, we do.
And I want to
thank you on behalf
of our club members.
And bless you
for your gift
to our hospital.
The children
will bless you, too,
in all the years to come.
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me, sir,
but I can hear
the train coming now.
Excuse me.
Better get aboard,
Charles.
All right.
Good-bye, everybody.
Roger, Ann,
come see the train.
Come on, Charlie.
You can see
they get off.
All right.
I want
to see the rooms,
the private ones.
I've seen berths.
I've slept in two uppers
and one lower with Papa.
Good-bye, Joe.
Good-bye, Charles.
Good-bye, Emmy.
Good-bye.
And don't forget
to write, love.
I will.
You write, too.
I'll send you
my address.
Good-bye.
Don't jump on
the seats, Roger.
Roger,
what did I tell you?
Porter,
there's one more bag.
I think it got taken
to the other car.
Will you get it, please?
Yes, sir.
Charlie, the train's
going to start.
I don't want to
get carried away.
Oh, boy!
Maybe it's too late!
Maybe I'll have
to go along!
There's plenty of time.
You run along,
we'll follow.
Charlie.
Just a minute.
I want you to know
I think you were right
to make me leave.
It's best for your mother.
Best for all of us.
You saw what happened
to her last night.
She's not very strong,
you know.
I don't think
she could stand
the shock.
I remember once,
when she was
a little girl...
The train's moving,
Uncle Charlie!
Listen, Charlie.
I want you to forget
all about me.
Forget that I ever
came to Santa Rosa.
Your hands!
Let me go,
Uncle Charlie!
Let me go!
I've got to
do this, Charlie,
so long as you know
what you do about me.
Not yet, Charlie.
Let it get
a little faster.
Just a little faster.
Faster.
Now!
Santa Rosa
has gained and lost a son,
a son that
she can be
proud of.
Brave, generous, kindly.
With all of
the splendid dignity...
I'm glad you were
able to come, Jack.
I couldn't have faced it
without someone who knew.
I did know more.
I couldn't tell you.
I know.
He thought the world
was a horrible place.
He couldn't have been
very happy ever.
No.
He didn't trust people.
He seemed to hate them.
He hated
the whole world.
You know, he said
that people like us
had no idea
what the world
was really like.
Well, it's not
quite as bad as that,
but sometimes
it needs a lot
of watching.
It seems to go crazy
every now and then.
Like your Uncle Charlie.
The beauty of
their souls, the sweetness
of their characters
live on with us forever.
