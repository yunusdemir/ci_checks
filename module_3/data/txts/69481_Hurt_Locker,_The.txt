Approaching.
I think we have touchdown.
- Little to the right.
- Going to the right.
<i>Hello, mum.</i>
Now, push it in.
I can't.
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man.
How about I pretend it's your dick?
You'll never get in if you did that.
- Here. Let me have a shot.
- Give me a second.
- No, come on. My dick, man.
- Go.
Fucker.
- Got that.
- Yeah.
Here we go.
Oh, look at that.
- Nice 155, huh?
- Yeah.
It's going to
do some fucking damage.
Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge.
I got that.
Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total.
That blast is going to
roast straight out there.
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.
Yep.
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way.
But we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee.
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.
- No problem.
Bot is moving.
<i>Let me know what you got, Eldridge.</i>
Good to go.
All right. Wagon's
set up. Bot moves.
Uh-oh. We got goats, guys.
Goats twelve o'clock. Watch out.
Load them little bastards up.
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.
- You build that?
- No, the U.S. Army did.
All right. Looks like
I'm going down there.
You don't like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?
Oh, I love it.
So, if everything looks okay
when I get down there
I'm just going
to set it up and bip it.
Give these people
something to think about.
Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us.
We're just going to blow up
their little fuckin' road.
Sounds good.
Craving a burger, is that strange?
- Not for you.
- No, okay.
Helmet on.
Happy trails.
Blaster One, can you read me?
Roger that, Blaster One.
You're good to go.
<i>You're looking good, Blaster One.</i>
Nice and hot in here.
One fifty.
Roger that, 150 meters.
Hi.
- Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you from?
Where are you from?
California?
- Hey, get out of here, man.
- Where?
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet
and greet. Now get out of here.
Now.
Go.
You making friends again, Sanborn?
All day long.
Twenty-five.
<i>Twenty-five meters.</i> Roger that.
You are now in the kill zone.
Thanks for reminding me.
That's what I'm here for, baby.
Okay.
The dets are good.
<i>Roger that.</i>
I'm laying on the charge...
Nice and sweet.
We're good to go.
I'm coming back.
- Five meters out.
- Five meters. Roger that.
<i>Hey, Sanborn.</i>
- You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening.
Needs grass.
We gonna start our grass business?
That's right, man.
I'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it.
It's going to be called
"Sanborn and Sons".
We'll be rich.
<i>I like that. Crabgrass,
St. Augustine, man.</i>
<i>I'm a scholar on this shit.</i>
<i>How about this?
You sell it, I fertilize it.</i>
<i>- 25.
- 25 meters. Roger that.</i>
Sanborn!
Butcher shop, two o'clock,
dude has a phone!
Why is Eldridge running?
- Make him put it down!
- Put down the phone!
Come on, guys. Talk to me.
Drop the phone!
Drop your phone!
Hey, burn him, Eldridge. Burn him!
- Put down the cell phone!
- Eldridge, burn him!
- Get out of the way.
- Drop your phone!
<i>Make him put it down!
Go get it!</i>
<i>- Come on, Eldridge!</i>
- I can't get a shot!
Thompson!
Anywhere's good.
<i>- Is that everything?</i>
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Come in.
Sergeant James.
JT Sanborn, my man.
Hey. Hi, how are you? Will.
I'm Will.
Welcome to Bravo Company,
welcome to Camp Victory.
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty.
Oh, no. They changed
that about a week ago.
Victory sounds better.
All right. Well, at least I'm
in the right place, right?
While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?
Yeah, no problem.
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.
We get a lot of mortars at night.
The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through.
That's why it's up there.
Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar round
from coming in through
the roof, you know.
Besides, I like the sunshine.
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.
- I heard he was a good tech.
- Yeah, he was.
He was a great team leader too.
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything.
I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best.
- Appreciate it.
- All right.
Cool.
Home sweet home, right?
<i>Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?</i>
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle.
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, than not have them.
<i>Yeah, but they don't do anything.</i>
Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead.
<i>Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead.</i>
Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead.
<i>How's a fuckin' tank
supposed to stop that?</i>
- Would you shut the fuck up Owen, please?
- Sorry.
Just trying to scare the new guy.
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan too.
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.
- Copy that.
Move.
Move!
<i>Blaster One, this is Victory Main.</i>
<i>Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.</i>
Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?
Victory Main, Victory Main.
This is Blaster Mike.
Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over.
<i>Victory Main, figures to follow.
Three-four-five-three is your grid. Over.</i>
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don't see anybody in fatigues.
<i>Give us a second to confirm grid. Over.</i>
Watch your feet.
<i>Set visual is three-four-five-three grid.
Over.</i>
Got the Humvee.
Friendly!
Friendly!
Ah, here we go.
They abandoned their vehicle.
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James.
Yeah, I got it.
Let's move.
Friendly.
<i>- Morning, boys.</i>
- Sir.
Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys.
- Let's step out and I'll show you what's going on.
- All right.
Down on that block 20 meters,
this side of the mosque.
East side of the street.
Our informant says he saw
a pair of wires
going into a rubble pile.
- It's a possible IED.
- Yeah.
- I trust this guy, I know him.
- Okay, I'll handle it.
- Do you want to talk him or...?
- No.
Good. Keep your boys back.
We'll be good. Thank you.
Specialist, bring up the Humvee.
What's going on?
I'm going to break out the suit.
- What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it.
Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?
I'll handle it.
It's kind of tight down here, James.
Ready?
Good?
You don't have to go down there.
We already have the bot halfway up.
I'll be all right.
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?
How's it looking, Eldridge?
- Good to go.
- Let's do it.
- Got tools?
- Got two.
All right, let's rock and roll, man.
- He's a rowdy boy.
- He's reckless.
Blaster One, what's going on?
<i>Blaster One! What are you doing?</i>
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike.
What's with the smoke on
the side of the road? Over.
<i>Hey, James, can you hear me?</i>
What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over.
<i>Creating a diversion.</i>
From what? Is there a threat?
Eldridge, get up on the wall, Move!
Tell me what you see, specialist.
All right, I got him.
He's walking down range.
James, the smoke
is killing my visibility.
Where are you in relationship to the IED?
Are you within 100 meters yet?
<i>Hell, I don't know Sanborn, but I'll tell
you when I'm standing over it, cowboy.</i>
Take cover!
Oh, no. A car stopped
in front of him, Sanborn.
Shit, James! <i>James, come back now.</i>
EOD pulled a nine
on this Haji in a car.
You want me to send backup?
I got it.
- Sanchez, Harris!
- Negative! Negative!
Stand down!
The blast will come up the block.
<i>Stay clear around the corner.</i>
<i>EOD has the situation
under control, over.</i>
Where you going?
Want to back up?
Get out of the car!
- Get out of the car!
- Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?
Back up.
Hello?
Want to get back?
It's that way.
Back.
<i>Taxi's moving.</i>
Get out of the car!
Stop!
On the ground! Stay down!
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent,
he sure the hell is now.
Roger that. That's real funny.
Got something.
Hello baby.
Gotcha.
All right.
We're done.
<i>Good to go.</i>
Come down, specialist.
Roger.
Got a wire.
Hang on.
Where are you going?
Secondary.
Shit.
Take cover. Get in the wall.
Get in the wall.
That wasn't so bad. First time working
together. What do you think?
I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me.
- We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No.
We're going on a mission.
And my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions.
It's combat, buddy.
Hey.
It's just 39 days.
38 if we survive today.
Hey, it's "Mr. Be All You Can Be".
What's up, doc?
Not much. How are you?
I'm good.
Got a question about that
song, "Be All You Can Be".
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?
<i>I mean, I think it's logical.</i>
This is war. People die
all the time. Why not me?
You got to change
the record in our head.
You gotta start thinking
about other things.
Okay. Stop obsessing.
<i>Right now, what are you thinking about?</i>
You want to know what
I'm thinking about, doc?
- Yeah.
- This is what I'm thinking about, doc.
Here's Thompson, okay.
He's dead. He's alive.
Here's Thompson.
He's dead. He's alive.
He's dead. He's alive.
Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?
Come on. You want the cool shit?
Come on, come on. It's the tight shit, man.
Wanna buy DVDs?
Wanna buy DVD?
Fuck you.
Come, come, please, please.
New releases. Look.
Hello, Hello.
Want to buy DVDs? Very good, Very good.
How much?
One for five and two for nine.
Three for twelve.
Three for thirteen and I don't
give you tax, Very good, man, Look.
No tax?
All right, What do you got?
What do you got?
You know, you smart shit.
You not like those stupid fucks.
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.
You're a smart kid.
Give me your best one, okay?
- Here, this the best one.
- This is a good one?
- Yeah, The best shit, man.
- Okay.
Here you go.
I'll take one.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
Want a cigarette?
Get out of here.
You shouldn't smoke.
Thank you. Take it easy.
I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again.
What's that?
- Yesterday.
- Mm-hmm.
Wasn't cool.
Yeah, I know.
You'll get it, though.
- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah.
I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD.
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
redneck piece of trailer trash like you.
Looks like you're on the right track.
<i>We'll see you out there.</i>
Let's go, move!
Shit. Get out of the way. Move.
Hallo.
- Where is it?
- It's behind the wall.
- All right.
- See any wires? Any smoke?
No, I didn't look.
So, how do you know it's a bomb?
The car has been parked illegally.
The suspension is sagging. There's
definitely something heavy in the trunk.
Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see.
You want me to go close to it?
Yeah. No-no, I don't. I'm kidding.
Shit.
It's coming from over here!
Blaster One, You there?
Blaster One, you hear me?
Here.
Shit.
Let's go, guys.
Let it go.
I got top cover.
That's a negative, specialist.
Eldridge, you stay with me.
Sanborn, you take top cover.
Shit.
Blaster Mike in position.
What do you got?
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable.
He's not going to make it.
We're leaving in 15 minutes.
Got a survival wound, sir.
He's not going to make it.
Oh, God.
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.
What are you doing?
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortable.
I need my kit and my cans.
What's going on down there, Eldridge?
<i>I'm getting his kit and his cans.
Cover me, please.</i>
Kit and cans.
Got a lot of deck cord, electrical.
I'm looking for the initiating system.
Well, it's not in the back seat.
I don't think.
All right. It's not in the back seat.
Got a young man on the roof,
your nine o'clock. Keep an eye on him.
Roger that.
It's not in the front seat.
It's not in the door.
Not on the floors.
Not in the glove box.
If you haven't found it yet,
it's probably under the car.
Yeah. No wire leads under... the car.
It's all in here somewhere.
- Hey, Sanborn.
- Yeah.
You got eyes on some guy
with a video camera?
No, Where?
He's right at my twelve
o'clock, you see him?
He's pointing the fucking
thing right at me.
Shit.
Negative, I don't see him.
<i>Hey, Sanborn. He's right at my
twelve o'clock. Look! Twelve o'clock!</i>
Roger that. I got him.
<i>Getting ready to put me on YouTube.</i>
- Little shady.
- Yeah, he looks shady. Keep and eye on him.
Okay. So, what's the play?
Be smart. Make a good decision, over.
Got more wire.
Leads fucking nowhere.
Fuck!
<i>Hey, James, how you doing?</i>
I'm wonderful. How are you?
You know, we've been here a while.
<i>We need to get out of here soon.</i>
Uh-huh.
We got a lot of eyes on us, James.
We need to get out of here.
Roger that. I'm going
to figure this out.
<i>James, we need to get out of here.</i>
James, do you copy?
Fuck it, I get it.
Fuck me.
- Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?
- All clear.
James, the evac
is complete, we can leave.
Let the engineers handle this mess.
- We moving?
- That's affirmative.
Interesting.
What's up with, James?
He's not answering.
Yeah, I think he removed his headset.
Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?
Hey, James!
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on.
Uh... that's a negative.
<i>That, yeah, that's not going to happen.</i>
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at six o'clock.
<i>- What the hell is he doing?</i>
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing.
Looks like, he's checking the oil.
They're communicating
with your cameraman.
This is real bad man.
Get behind the Jersey barrier.
I can't see James from here.
Get down now!
We can go!
Bastard.
We're done.
Sanborn, let's get out of here.
Woo.
That was good.
- Hey, James.
- What?
Never turn your headset off again.
You the guy in the bomb suit?
No, sir. Sir, that's Sergeant James.
He's right here.
- Hey, James.
- Yeah?
Someone's here to see you.
You the guy in the flaming car,
Sergeant James?
Afternoon, sir.
Uh, yes, sir.
Well, that's just hot shit.
You're a wild man, you know that?
- Uh, yes, sir.
- He's a wild man.
You know that?
I want to shake your hand.
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.
How many bombs have you disarmed?
Uh, I'm not quite sure.
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I asked you a question.
873, sir.
Eight hundred! And seventy-three.
That's just hot shit.
873.
- Counting today, sir, yes.
- That's gotta be a record.
What's the best way to... to go
about disarming one of these things?
The way you don't die, sir.
That's a good one.
That's spoken like a wild man.
That's good.
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hey, wait a minute.
Look who it is.
I want my five bucks back, buddy.
Five dollars for what, man?
You crazy now?
Yeah. The DVD you sold me was crap.
You crazy, man. That's impossible.
It's Hollywood special effects.
No. It was shaky.
It was out of focus, buddy.
- What, you want donkey porn?
- It's crap.
Girls on dog?
Gay sex, man?
Anything you want, you get.
I hook you up, man.
All right, What... what's your name?
- Beckham.
- Beckham like the soccer player?
Yeah, man, It's like soccer player.
Now give me my ball.
Are you a soccer player?
Yeah, man. Best of the best.
I'm better than Beckham.
- You play goalie?
- Yes, I play goalie.
I'll make you a deal. If you can stop the
ball, I'm going to give you five bucks.
- But if you can't...
- And what if... what if I can't?
Listen to me. If I score,
I'm going to keep your ball.
- Deal?
- Deal.
Get up there.
Go on.
- Let's see what you got, hot stuff.
- Are you ready?
On three, Ready?
One, two, three. Aah!
Shit.
Come on. Where's the five dollars?
Man, come on.
All right, I got ya.
Good job, dude.
Here's five.
You're an EOD, boomala, boomala.
That's right.
It's fun, no?
It's cool? It's gangster.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think so.
Tell you what, I... I'm going to buy...
Let me see if I have
enough money, yeah. Five.
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?
But, if it's shaky... look at me...
or out of focus...
or any way not 100%.
I'm going to chop off your goddamned
head with a dull knife.
How do you feel about that?
I'm just kidding.
Here, You're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid, aren't ya?
Owen.
Hi.
- Hi, sir.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Good.
- What's wrong?
- Brakes are squeaking.
Don't trust the mechanics
around here, You know.
- So, how you doing?
- Good.
I just want to check the oil.
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...
I'm feeling pretty squared
away, actually, doc.
I'm glad to hear it.
So, you getting along with the other
soldiers in your unit?
Yeah. My team's great.
My team leader is inspiring.
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No.
He's going to get me killed.
I almost died yesterday.
At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong.
You know, this doesn't have
to be a bad time in your life.
Going to war is a, is a once
in a lifetime experience.
It could be fun.
And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?
I've done my field duty.
Where's that? Yale?
Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.
These talks are voluntary.
Look, I'm sorry.
I appreciate what you're saying.
I do.
I appreciate our sessions together.
But you need to come out from
behind the wire, see what we do.
Well,
if the circumstance calls for it, I will.
Just like every other soldier.
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!
Firing now.
Eee, ooh...
- Ready for second det?
- Ready.
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.
Goddamn it.
I think it forgot my gloves down there.
- What?
- I forgot my gloves.
Hang on.
You know, these detonators
misfire all the time.
What are you doing?
I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire.
He'd be obliterated to nothing.
<i>His helmet would be left.
You could have that.</i>
Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside.
<i>Yeah. There'd be half
a helmet somewhere,</i>
<i>bits of hair.</i>
Ask for a change
in technique and protocol,
make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?
You'd have to write the report.
- Are you serious?
- I can't write it.
No, I mean, are you serious
about killing him?
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV.
- Roger that.
I got four armed men.
They're in Haji gear.
All right. Go slow and easy man.
Be ready now.
All right. Careful now, guys. Careful.
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.
- I got 'em.
<i>Obre! Obre!</i>
Put your gun down!
On your knees!
Put your gun down!
- <i>Obre</i>, motherfucker!
- Hold up your hands.
Get down, motherfucker. <i>Obre!</i>
Put your gun down now!
Put your gun down!
Advance, advance...
Hands high.
- Eldridge, cover!
- I got you.
Pistol, off your hip, now.
What you want me to do?
Keep my hands up or take off the pistol?
- Keep your hands up.
- Okay.
Easy, easy.
Got it!
Can I touch my fucking head now?
Slowly.
We're on the same fucking side, guys.
Jesus.
You guys are wired fucking tight,
you know that?
Well, this is no place for a picnic.
What are you guys doing here?
We have a flat tire.
Can you help us?
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?
We have spares, but
we've used up our wrench.
How do you use up a wrench?
Well, the uh, the guy over there
with the red thing on his head.
He threw it at someone.
- All right.
- Thank you.
That's Chris.
This is the wrench man.
- Hello, wrench man.
- That's Jimmy.
You know, you can shoot people here.
You don't have to throw a wrench at 'em.
Fuck off.
Take a look at this.
I picked these guys up in Najaf.
Nine of hearts, that's one.
And the other, jack of clubs.
- These the same guys?
- Yep, That's them.
Does he need a little help there?
What's the problem
with the tire? Come on.
No good, boss.
This wrench is too small.
All right, solutions? Anyone?
I think there's another wrench in the
back of the Humvee if you want to check.
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. Let's do it.
How long you guys out here?
Specialist, what do we got?
- We have... 23 more days or 22...
- Oh yeah.
No one's counting.
Contact left.
Take cover.
Chris, take the 50.
Jimmy, take that in the Humvee.
- Got it.
- Come on!
Charlie, go!
Go, go, go!
We need more ammo.
Look inside.
Take all the go-bags, Jimmy.
- What are we shooting at?
- I don't know.
Fuck. The packages are gone!
<i>They won't get far on foot.</i>
Bring 'em back those fuckers now.
I'm out 500000 fucking pounds.
I forgot,
it's 500000 dead or alive.
- Okay. Jimmy, give me the Barret.
- Yeah.
I can't see a thing.
Come on!
Chris is shooting wild.
Gotta conserve the ammo.
Hey, Chris, can you hear me?
Hey, Chris! Chris! Can you hear me?
Chill out on the 50!
Roger that.
- 50's down.
- They shot Chris.
It must be coming from that building.
I can't see anything.
Movement on the roof.
Yeah?
Three meters higher.
I'm going to adjust.
Fuck!
Fuck, he's dead.
We've got to get out of here now!
Dammit.
This is Alpha Nine.
We're in deep shit.
I'll get on the Barret.
Go, go, go.
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire.
Go, go, go.
- No, Sanborn, no. Don't go up there.
- Got it!
Go, buddy, stay low!
Stay low!
I have two KIA.
Correction, three KIA...
our grid last lock stat...
Stay low!
Can you get me some help?
- Behind you.
- Yeah.
<i>Breathe easy.</i>
<i>- I got movement.</i>
- Yeah.
On the ridge of that house.
850 meters.
- See it.
- By the window.
- You have target.
- Got it.
All right, here little left.
Just breathe easy.
- I'm out of ammo.
- Hmm?
I'm out of ammo.
Eldridge, we need ammo.
Where is it?
Check on the dead guy, man.
<i>It's on the dead man.</i>
<i>Eldridge!</i>
I'm looking.
We need that ammo, man.
All right, man.
Oh, here.
Thanks.
All right. Got it.
Same target.
It's fucking jammed.
Let me see it.
Fuck!
Aw, shit.
The blood's making it jam. Eldridge!
Shit!
You gotta clean the blood off, man.
It's making 'em jam.
Specialist!
<i>- Clean the blood off.</i>
- Okay.
Clean it. Clean it.
<i>You gotta clean it, man.</i>
- How?
- Spit and rub.
All right.
<i>Spit and rub, buddy.
Spit and rub.</i>
It's not working.
It's not coming off.
Spit and rub. Spit and rub.
Here, take it out.
- Use your camel. Use your camel.
- Where is it?
You all right?
Here, use that.
Just breathe, buddy.
Come on. Just breathe in.
Good. Here, squeeze.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Rub that ojive, baby.
Come on. You got it.
You're doing good, man.
You're doing real good.
- Got 'em?
- Yeah.
I'm going to keep
you safe, buddy, all right?
Now let's get these bastards.
Scan your sectors.
Scan your sectors.
Kill that fuckin' asshole.
Son of a bitch.
Nice. He's down.
Second one is out of range.
Twenty meters to
the right of the building.
I got him.
<i>Fire when ready.</i>
<i>He's moving. He's moving.
To the building.</i>
- Follow him. You got him?
- Got him.
<i>He's down.</i>
Goodnight. Thanks for playing.
Window. At the window. At the window.
He's still there.
Left window.
Left window. Got him?
Got him.
He's down.
- Hey, Owen.
- Yeah?
Can you grab the juice
out of the pack, please?
Sure.
I think we're out.
- Got anything left to drink?
- You could try that one.
Thank you.
Drink. Drink it.
Things are real quiet.
Yeah, I don't like it.
- Hey, Will?
- Yeah?
<i>At your six o'clock,</i>
<i>I see movement on the bridge.
Right on the tracks.</i>
Well, handle it.
Should I fire?
It's your call, buddy.
Good job.
Hey, Sanborn.
I think we're done.
Okay? You all right?
That's what you get for hitting
your fucking team leader, motherfucker.
- Oh man.
- I'll be right back, I gotta piss.
Owen.
Another round, boy.
That's and order.
Well, yes sir, Sgt. James, sir.
You're not very good
with people, are you, sir?
But you're a good warrior.
Give me your mug.
There ya go, sir.
You acquitted yourself well on the field
of battle today, specialist.
Cheers.
Uh, I'm too old for this shit.
- I was scared.
- Yeah?
Well, everyone's a coward
about something, you know.
You're good. You're real good.
Just what do we have here?
Will has possessions.
I didn't know you owned anything, Will.
Let's see what you got here, Will.
Who is that?
That's my son.
He's a tough little bastard.
Nothing like me.
You mean to tell me you married?
Well, you know,
I had a girlfriend and...
...she got pregnant,
so we got married.
We got divorced.
Or I thought we got divorced.
She's still living in the house.
And she says we're still together.
So I don't know.
What does that make her?
Dumb for still being with your ass.
Hey.
She ain't fuckin' dumb,
all right?
She's just loyal.
She's just loyal. That's all.
How 'bout you guys?
You got... you got a girl?
What do you got?
My only problem is the girl I do like.
I can't stop her from talking
about babies, man.
Well, give her your sperm, stud.
Go on. Do it.
- C'mon, chicken. Just give it to her.
- No. Hell no.
Make babies.
I know when I'm ready, and I
ain't ready for that yet. I know that.
Well, well...
what do we have here?
Uh, components.
They're bomb parts. Signatures.
Yeah, I see that, but
what they doing under your bed?
Well...
Aha.
There we go. This one.
This one is from the UN-building.
Flaming car.
Dead man's switch. Boom.
This guy was good. I like him.
- Relay.
- Ah... look at this one.
This one, y'all, is from
our first call together.
This box is full of stuff
that almost killed me.
And what about this one?
- Where's this one from, Will?
- It's my wedding ring.
Like I said, stuff that almost killed me.
You know, I just think
it's really interesting
to hold something in your hand
that could have killed anyone.
Damn that. It's all that shit
from RadioShack.
It's interesting.
I think it's interesting too.
Well, I think you hit me harder
than I hit you, motherfucker,
therefore I owe you a punch.
Now get your ass up. C'mon.
- C'mon. Let's go. C'mon.
- He's right.
Come on!
All right, hold on boys.
We need some rules.
Sanborn, no face shots.
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot.
Sergeant James, take off your shirt.
Yes, sir.
What happened?
My momma dropped me
when I was a baby.
Looks like frag scars.
- Let it go, Eldridge. C'mon.
- All right.
Nice and big.
Ooh!
You like that, huh?
That's all you got?
Come on.
Bring some, C'mon.
Ooh!
Woo! God damn.
That's gotta hurt.
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, he's all right.
- Get up, bitch.
All right, bitch.
- What do you got now?
- Get the fuck off me!
- What do you got?
- Get off me, you mother fucker.
What do you got? What do you got?
Woo, he's a wild one.
We got a wild one.
- C'mon, Sanborn. Get him.
- That's right.
- Ride him, baby.
- Get off me.
- C'mon, bitch.
- C'mon, guys.
What do you got?
Get off me.
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm just kidding, motherfucker.
Shit.
You're all right, Sanborn.
You're all right, man.
Owen, get this guy a drink.
C'mon.
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.
- All right, here.
- All right.
- See you later.
- Be safe.
All right, come on big boy.
Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet.
He hurt his knee.
C'mon, man.
Steps. C'mon.
Step. Step.
All right, lay down. Lay down.
All right. Get some rest.
Hey, James, you think I got
what it takes to put on the suit?
Hell, no.
Night, boy.
Oh!
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death
of sitting behind a desk all the time.
It'd be a privilege.
Hop in, Colonel.
Hey, Doc.
<i>Not to insult your intelligence, sir.</i>
But if the shit hits the fan,
please don't fire out the Humvee.
The round will just bounce around
and someone might get shot.
- I don't like getting shot.
- Understood, Sergeant.
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.
We're just here to pick up
some unexploded ordinance.
Sergeant James is
gonna see what the deal is.
And then hopefully we'll be
gone in a couple minutes.
- We've gotta gear up.
- For what?
Security hasn't gone in.
Go in quiet. Radios off.
- Roger.
- Roger that.
- Glad you came.
- Stay safe. All right.
Psst, Psst.
Clear.
Hey.
Cigarette's still smoking.
It's all our shit.
<i>Motherfucking goldmine.</i>
<i>Watch out for trips.</i>
I got something.
I know this kid.
His name's Beckham. He sells DVDs.
You ever see a body bomb before, man?
It's disgusting. Let's get outta here.
Hold it.
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and
deck cord you can get your hands on.
Let's get all this
ordinance outta here.
And we're just gonna...
we're gonna blow the place.
Roger. Just blow it.
What are you doing?
Yeah? Putting
the stones in to move.
Yeah. That's really wonderful,
but it's
a little bit unsafe today.
Yeah, it's a little unsafe.
So maybe... I don't know.
I'm thinking maybe we should move?
No?
Fuck.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- You?
- Yeah.
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.
No one in or out, okay?
Cancel the det. Cancel the det.
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, man.
I don't know.
I'm coming out.
<i>Roger that.</i>
- Where are you from?
- New York.
The Big Apple.
Are you from Iraq?
I love it here.
This is a beautiful place.
But it's not too safe here, okay?
So, I think we need,
we need to move. Please.
You think it's that little Beckham?
No. I don't.
- You're positive?
- Sure.
Hey, I don't know, man.
They all look the same, right?
I know.
- Will seemed sure. That was weird.
- Very weird.
Please, just move.
Move. Move.
Move on. Move on. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Will's very weird.
I mean he keeps bomb
parts under his bed.
I'll bet you he won't keep any
of these parts under his bed.
Bye-bye.
Yeah, bye-bye, Bye, Thank you.
Hey, Colonel.
Let's go.
Hallo, thank you.
IED!
Cambridge!
<i>Get back. Get down.</i>
<i>Stay back.</i>
<i>Stay back, Sanborn, keep 'em back.</i>
Is anyone hurt?
Cambridge! Fuck!
Where is Cambridge?
Cambridge, come out.
We gotta go.
Oh, he's dead.
Hey, we gotta find Cambridge.
Doc!
- Eldridge!
- Doc!
Eldridge, c'mon, man. C'mon.
I just saw him.
He was walking right here.
I know. He's dead.
Look, he's dead. Okay?
It's all right, man.
You're all right, man. You're all right.
Hello?
Hello?
<i>Will?</i>
Hello?
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey, let me ask you a question.
What happened to the little kid
that used to work here?
Sorry, man.
English, I... no English.
No-no English.
You no speak English now.
Little kid, Beckham is his name.
He sells... He sells DVDs.
DVD, One DVD, $5.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
- $5.
- Excuse me, soldier.
You in charge of this area here?
- What's up?
- You know this guy?
How do we know
that he's not giving intel
to insurgents, telling them
where to drop mortars?
I think he's just selling DVDs.
Well, he's a security risk.
We should get rid of him.
What are you looking at?
He's just selling DVDs, man.
All the merchants are cleared.
By who?
I couldn't do anything with him
without the say so from my CO.
Okay, Fuck.
Fuck.
Does this change anything?
You speak English now,
don't you?
- <i>Yalla, yalla.</i> Drive.
- Okay.
- Ok.
- This is his house?
Beckham's house?
Wait here.
Fuck.
Psst, psst. Shh.
You speak English?
English. French. Arabic.
Good. Open your vest.
Ah, stay there. Stay.
Tell me what you know about Beckham.
For whom?
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb.
Stay right there.
- I don't know.
- You don't know.
But please, sit down.
I am Professor Navid.
This is my home.
You are a guest.
Please, sit down.
I'm a guest.
Just... I'm looking for
the people responsible
for-for-for Beckham.
You are CIA, no?
I am very pleased to see
CIA in my home.
Please, sit.
How can I...
Be careful. The gun can go off.
USA, friendly coming in.
<i>Stop! Get the fuck down!</i>
USA, friendly.
<i>- On your knees!
- Get on your knees, now.</i>
- On your knees.
- You will be shot! Don't move!
- On your knees.
- Down, now!
- Open your jacket!
- Opening my jacket.
<i>Cover. Get him down.</i>
- On the ground.
- I have a weapon.
Don't fucking move.
- Tower, hold cover. Searching.
- I have a weapon.
- Gun.
- Like I said.
Weapons clear.
ID?
What the fuck are you doing?
I was at a whorehouse.
All right, if I let you in, will
you tell me where it is exactly?
Yeah.
<i>James, do you copy?</i>
<i>James do you have your ears on?</i>
<i>James?</i>
This is James. What's up?
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Look, we have a tank explosion
in the Green Zone.
We have to post-blast assessment,
see if it was a suicide bomber.
And if so, how the fuck did he do it?
Okay.
Where'd you say you were again?
I didn't, Sergeant.
Let's go.
What happened to your head, James?
Hey, you ready?
Game face, buddy. Let's go.
- You ready?
- Let's do this.
Rock and roll. Moving out.
USA friendlies coming through.
Make room, guys. Make room.
Hey, Sanborn.
Oh, shit!
- An oil tanker?
- Yep.
That's a pretty long flight, huh?
This is the edge of the blast radius.
Jesus.
So, where's our triggerman?
Burnt up in the flames, man.
Suicide bomber.
We're never going
to find a body in that shit.
What if there was no body?
What if it was a remote det?
A really good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?
Right here.
Perfect vantage point.
Outside the blast radius to sit back
and watch us clean up their mess.
- Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do.
- I could stand to get in a little trouble.
- No, man! This is bullshit.
You got three infantry platoons behind
you whose job it is to go Haji huntin'.
That ain't our fuckin' job.
You don't say no to me, Sanborn.
I say no to you.
You know there are guys
watching us right now.
They're laughing at this.
Okay, I'm not okay with that.
Now, turn off your goddamned
torch 'cause we're going.
Now we know where their
oil tanker came from.
<i>No shit. Same kind.</i>
- We're close.
- Yeah.
These alleyways
are probably set up on a grid.
We're going to need
to split up, flush 'em out.
Sanborn, you take one.
Eldridge, take two.
I got three.
Rally point at your intersection.
- Ready, move.
- Wait, rally point when?
Fuck.
<i>Ipsura, ipsura!</i>
Go, go!
Shit, Ahh.
Shit.
- You got contact?
- Who was it? What's going on?
- What do you got?
- It's Eldridge.
Go, go.
Man down. Man down.
Shit! Shit! Shit!
- Negative, negative. It's not him.
- He's gone.
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
Tankers and troops are that way.
- Let's go this way.
- Fuck.
Use your torch. On three.
Ready?
One, two, three.
- Fuck!
- Shit.
Softly, softly, softly.
On three.
One. Two. Three.
Now. Go, go, go!
- Eldridge, you okay?
- Fuck, dude. I'm hit.
Hit him in the fuckin' leg.
Come on.
- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No. You're fine, man.
Am I dead? Am I dead?
I'm going to put some
pressure down, come on.
You're all right.
Look at me, look at me.
You all right.
All right, buddy. You ready to get up?
On three, ready? One, two, three.
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?
Wanna buy some DVDs?
Wanna play some soccer?
What's up?
Come on, man.
Wanna play some...
Aww, fuck.
How you doing, buddy?
Doc says you're going to be okay.
My fucking femur is shattered
in nine places.
He said I'll be walking in six months
if I'm fucking lucky.
- Six months ain't bad, huh?
- It's not bad?
Fuckin' sucks, man.
- Ah, ah!
- Take it easy.
You see that? You fuckin' see that?
That's what happens when
you shoot someone, you motherfucker.
Sorry.
- Sorry, Owen.
- Fuck you, Will.
Really. Fuck you.
Thanks for saving my life,
but we didn't have to go out
looking for trouble to get
your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.
Come home safe, man.
- See you on the other side, man.
- All right.
Let's get out of this fucking desert!
Don't move.
If you keep
walking we will shoot you.
Move him back.
Keep that translator back.
- But the bomb was forced on him.
- Get him back!
Don't move! Stay still.
If you keep walking
we will shoot you!
<i>Get that translator back, now.</i>
- He's not a bad man.
- Clear! Give him room. Give him room.
Hey, what do you got?
He came walking up to our checkpoint.
Said he had a bomb strapped to him.
But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.
Then he starts begging us
to take it off of him.
Help this man.
He's not a bad man.
He's not a bad man? He got
a bomb strapped to him.
This is a joke. He's trying
to pull us closer.
Yeah. I got it, I got it.
All right. Look...
Tell him to open his shirt slowly
and see what's inside.
Slowly, slowly.
Jesus.
All right, Sergeant,
I need a 75-meter perimeter.
- Get these guys back.
- You heard what he said. Get back.
You tell him to get on his knees
and touch the sky, okay?
Slowly.
Get down.
Okay, I need your radio.
- Can't we just shoot him?
- No.
He's a a family man.
He's not a bad man.
He's asking for help, only help.
Yeah, all right, You don't want
to die, get back! I got it.
Listen, I know
we've had our differences.
Eldridge, it happened, all right.
It's water under the bridge.
This is suicide, man.
That's why they call it
a suicide bomb, right?
Let's do this, Come on.
<i>He says the bomb may
have a timer, please hurry.</i>
- You alright in there?
- Yep.
Go get 'em.
- Let's do it. Watch for snipers, ha?
- Yeah.
Get your hands up.
<i>He says he has a family.</i>
<i>Please help him.</i>
Now, listen.
Look, It'd be a lot easier for me
to disarm this
if I just shoot you, Do you understand?
What's he saying?
He says: "I don't wish to die, I have a
family... Please take this off me."
Tell him to put his hands behind his
head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.
Look, that's not what I said.
Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will shoot him.
Listen.
Listen, listen.
You understand?
Okay.
What do you got here?
<i>He has four children.</i>
Shit.
Sanborn, we got a timer,
and we got a lot of wires, man.
I'm going to need
a little help on this.
Roger that. Tell me what you need.
Bolt cutters.
You gotta get down here
in two minutes or we're all fucked.
Roger that.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.
<i>He says: "please, I have a family."</i>
Shh.
I know, It's okay.
You're all right. You're all right.
<i>Please, don't leave me.</i>
You weren't fuckin' kidding.
Nope. What's this made out of?
Oh, man.
This case is hardened steel.
Shit.
- What's our time?
- We got two minutes.
Shit.
We're going need a torch
to get this off.
Well, we don't have one of those in
the fucking truck, man.
He's dead, man.
Hold on, man. Let me think.
Just let me think.
We're going to handle this.
It's okay. We got this.
Shh, okay.
Now listen, you're gonna get back.
It's just, we don't
got enough time, Sanborn.
I just gotta...
I gotta get these bolts off.
No. We got a minute and a half, man.
We gotta get out of here.
- I'll handle this, Just go.
- Come on, man.
Look, I'm right behind ya. Just go.
Fuck him! Come on. Let's go.
- Sanborn, I got the suit. Just go!
- James!
Sanborn, you have 45 seconds.
You have 45 seconds, Sanborn, leave.
You're fucking dead, man. Dead.
Go!
- Everybody get back!
- Go, go!
We got one.
Go, get back.
I can't. There's too many locks.
There's too many, I can't do it.
I can't get it off. I'm sorry. Okay?
You understand? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You hear me? I'm sorry.
- Get down now!
- I can help him.
Everybody, stay down! Stay down!
James!
Everybody up and out!
James!
You all right?
Aw, man.
I fuckin' hate this place.
Here, man. Have a hit.
I'm not ready to die, James.
Well, you're not going
to die out here, bro.
Another two inches.
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat.
I bleed out like a pig in the sand.
Nobody will give a shit.
I mean, my parents will care,
but they don't count, man. Who else?
I don't even have a son.
Well, you're going to have
plenty of time for that, amigo.
- Naw, man.
- You know?
I'm done.
<i>I want a son.</i>
I want a little boy, Will.
I mean, how do you
do it, you know?
Take the risk?
I don't know, I just...
I guess I don't think about it.
<i>But you realize every time you suit up,</i>
every time we go out
it's life or death.
You roll the dice
and you deal with it.
You recognize that, don't you?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I do.
But I don't know why.
Yeah.
I don't know, JT.
You know why I am the way I am?
Naw, I don't.
- Wow. You did some shopping.
- Yeah.
I got some soda.
We done?
You want to go get us some cereal
and I'll meet you at the checkout?
Okay. Cereal.
Where?
Some guy drove his truck to
the middle of an Iraqi market,
starts passing out free candies.
All the kids coming running up,
the families stuff.
He detonates.
They're saying 59 are dead.
You know they need more bomb techs.
You want to chop those up for me?
Boing, boing, boing.
Yeah.
You love playing with that.
You love playing with all
your stuffed animals.
You love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas.
You love everything, don't you? Yeah.
You know what, buddy?
Once you get older,
some of the things that you love
might not seem so special anymore.
Like your Jack in the Box.
Maybe you realize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animal
and then you forget
the few things you really love.
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's only one or two things.
With me I think it's one.
- Welcome to Delta Company.
- Sergeant.
