Greetz to all other respected RG's out there.Let the Legend Killing Continue...
<i>Yes?</i>
Can I help you?
Help.
What happened?
You scrape your hand?
<i>Come on in and, uh,</i>
we'll fix you right up.
<i>I haven"t seen you around here.
What"s your name?</i>
<i>My God.
You"re hot.</i>
You come on in now.
Sit over here.
Damn.
<i>Because I remember a
scripture that talked about the time...</i>
of Herod and the land of Canaan
when the slaughter...
of the innocent children of Israel
ran the streets red with blood.
Red! Red! Amen!
Hallelujah!
You fall
off your bike?
Now go ahead and lie back.
Let me put this in your mouth.
Come on now!
You're hot!
Lie back.
Open. There.
I'll take a look
at that hand.
That's really deep.
You shouldn't be
this far out.
Oh, my God!
<i>The Norman Rockwell age is dead.</i>
<i>That"s according to
social scientist Gareth Waltrip.</i>
<i>Waltrip"s recent study
on small-town life in America...</i>
<i>claims that America"s small towns
have suffered a loss...</i>
<i>of 15% of their population
over the last decade.</i>
<i>And more decay
is expected to come.</i>
<i>The report cites the sale of small
farms, deterioration of family life...</i>
<i>and the allure of the urban economy
as the primary causes.</i>
Welcome home.
Hi, Mom.
How you doing?
Hi, Grace.
<i>Thank you for coming.
I didn"t know what else to do.</i>
It's okay, Mom.
I'm here now.
Hi, Doc.
Hello, Grace.
It's certainly nice
to have you back.
The dean okayed me for one semester,
but he wasn't real happy about it.
Maybe you shouldn't
have come.
<i>I just... Doc?</i>
Maybe I...
I shouldn't have called.
It's okay, Mom.
Hi, Grace.
And who are you?
Are you the fairy princess?
No. I'm Margaret.
<i>- This is a costume.
- Oh.</i>
I had a crown
butJames took it.
<i>He did?
Where is James?</i>
<i>Outside.</i>
And what's he up to?
Margaret, let go of your sister.
It's okay, Mom.
<i>He is with
that damn bike.</i>
He never listens anymore.
You know, he won't listen to me!
- He never listens to anything I say to him.
- Mom, it... it's okay.
Grace, will you
walk me to the car?
<i>Sure, Doc.</i>
- Welcome to Psycho Central.
- Hey, James.
God, I had no idea
she was this bad.
The nightmares are what
made her finally call.
Now, if it
had gotten worse,
I would've called you
myself personally.
But I gave her
a prescription...
so that she'll sleep
through the night.
The really important thing is to just
simply get her out of the house.
- She hasn't left the house?
- Well, agoraphobia's a funny thing.
She'll come out,
but she won't take one step...
past this end
of the walkway here.
- You're kidding.
- That is it.
Now, what we have
to do is...
relax her.
Try not to let her
hear any bad news.
<i>When she sees the world as
a safe place, she"ll come around.</i>
<i>Why, good afternoon, ladies.</i>
Is she here for
the children, Doc?
Yes, ma'am.
That and her mother.
Oh, my God.
Jane and Rosa Nock.
They don't have much,
but what they have they...
Well, they try to share it
with my homebound patients.
<i>Probably left some turkey pot pie
for your mother.</i>
Oh, uh, Dr. Larson,
<i>I, um, I hate
to even ask this.</i>
<i>You"ve done so much.</i>
While I'm here
I've nothing coming in, so...
<i>- I was wondering...
- Say no more. You've got your old job back.</i>
Thanks.
<i>L"ll see you
first thing in the morning.</i>
To those who take strong drink,
He shall send angels.
Please...
Please, God, help me.
I have come for the children.
Charles Manson. Scorpio.
Killed eight people and an unborn baby.
Flavorite food:
Pistachio ice cream.
Lovely.
Great guitar player.
Could've been a rock star.
<i>- I got all 30 of them.
- Hmm.</i>
Who says kids don't
have heroes anymore?
Grace, how long
are you going to stay?
I'll stay 'til
Mom's feeling better.
They should just throw her in
the cracker factory and call it a day.
James.
Is Mom a crackpot?
Look, Mom's just...
She's sick.
And sometimes she gets real nervous
and then she gets afraid.
But you and I both know there's
nothing to be afraid of, right?
<i>- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Good.</i>
Now sleep tight.
Grace.
I like you better than Mom.
Go to sleep.
And then
the thermometer drops.
And then...
it breaks.
And then...
the boy...
When I turn,
he tries to...
<i>Come on, Mom.
We can beat this thing.</i>
<i>Now, let"s get this place
cleaned up, okay?</i>
That's all
I can remember.
I can never, never remember
how it starts.
It happens every night
like that.
It's just
a nightmare.
Just take the pills Doc Rob gave you
and it'll go away.
Why don't you
go upstairs?
I'll finish up here.
Thanks, Grace.
Mom, we're not Catholic.
I know.
Crazy.
Does the word "recycling"
mean anything to you?
Grace, I'm hot.
Okay. Time.
Blech.
Well, you've got a little fever,
but I think you'll live.
Good. I wanna live.
Keep this washcloth
on your head.
If you need anything
during the night, just yell.
<i>- Grace.
- Okay.</i>
James is feverish too.
Oh, great.
What do you think it is?
I mean...
It's probably just the flu, Mom.
Kids get sick.
Cavalry's here.
You never were
the fucking Brady Bunch.
Tell me about it.
So, looks like I'm gonna be
joining you in Doc Rob's office.
No. You won't.
You're lookin' at the new nurse
at Grand Island Junior High.
- No way!
- Yeah.
You can hear those teen boys' hormones
just poppin' clear down the hall.
And everything's
exactly the same.
How'd we grow up
so fast?
You grew up a little quicker than me.
Thanks for your support.
Just maybe you should think
about coming home to stay.
Look,
I'm just here to get Mom on her feet,
then I'm going back to school.
Open up.
- Come on, Michael. Help me out here.
- Uh-huh.
- Tastes like a strawberry.
- You lie.
<i>Michael. I'm sorry.</i>
He usually doesn't mind
having his temperature taken.
<i>- It's okay. I'll just
have to get the digital.</i>
Hello. Clinic.
<i>Well, just keep an eye on the fever
and don"t let it go above 102.</i>
<i>I have to go.
L"m sorry. Good-bye.</i>
<i>So, are you going to that
new treatment center in Denver?</i>
This week. The special kid
needs special treatment.
I'm not the one who needs
the special treatment.
Have you got a decent
clotting agent at the house?
Yeah, we've got plenty
of it around the house...
and we all know how to use it
in case of an emergency.
Well, I'd say you've got
the same fever as these other kids.
<i>But hemophilia is serious business.
I don"t want you to get cut anymore.</i>
One hundred percent
operational, captain.
<i>- Are you excited about this move?
- Yeah.</i>
I'll be with you guys
in just a minute, okay?
We'll get to you two next.
Hang in there, okay?
So, what do you think?
Why don't you
tell me, Doctor?
I don't know.
Flevers, shakes.
Definitely flu of some kind.
But no nausea, no diarrhea. No sinus.
Viruses are
always changing.
That's what makes 'em
such a fun date.
I think I'll keep the more
serious ones here tonight.
I hope you don't
have any plans.
<i>Mmm.</i>
Come to me.
He's also 103.
She reads the same.
Flour patients and no fluctuation?
Mom!
Dad.
Mom. Mom.
<i>Plenty of wet towels, yes.</i>
If it goes two-tenths
of a point higher, bring him in.
Grace.
Charlie, honey.
Oh, my God.
- Marcus?
- Dad.
Jesus, these kids are going up fast.
We've gotta break this.
Prep an ice bath.
- Charlie, I'm putting you in.
- No! Mom!
- Is it ready?
- Almost!
Honey, I'm gonna
cool you off.
No! Mom!
I'm comin' in.
Grab the other one.
Mom!
You've got to
stay there and cool off.
We have to cool you down.
<i>- Grace!
- I"ll get the last one.</i>
Calm down.
One more time.
Come on.
Help me out here.
Lie down. Down, down.
Grace!
Grace!
Okay. That's it.
We're done.
- Are you warm enough?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, go to sleep.
She was calling for you...
by the road.
But she's come in now.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I'm gonna head off.
You keep an eye on 'em
for the rest of the night,
<i>but call me immediately
if anything changes.</i>
Okay, Doc.
You still sure you want
to go into medicine?
That's it. Very nice.
Okay. All set.
Go say hello to Dad.
Hey.
You can take him home today
if you want, but he seems fine.
- Just like that?
- Well, he's asymptomatic. All the kids are.
Thanks.
So... that's it?
Looks like it.
- Whatever it was, it's gone.
- Whew.
Hail Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now...
Hail Mary, mother of God.
Mary, mother of God.
Mary, mother of...
Now and at the hour of death...
God!
<i>Sirens]</i>
<i>Let"s go, kid. Bedtime.</i>
Big day tomorrow.
Big move.
So you'll be a smaller fish
in a much bigger pond. That's okay.
- I liked being a big fish.
- Hey.
So, when we get to Denver,
you can run for mayor.
<i>...the slaughter of the innocent
children of Israel...</i>
<i>ran the streets
red with blood.</i>
<i>Red! Red!
Amen! Halleluiah!</i>
<i>According to God"s plan...</i>
I can't pry that kid away from that
idiot box. We ought to leave it here.
<i>- It's not an idiot box when Oprah is on.
- That's educational.</i>
Marcus, what did I
just get done telling you?
Go to bed.
We're moving in the morning.
I can't go.
<i>Donald? Donald!</i>
- Sandra?
- No! No!
<i>Sandra!</i>
Marcus!
Sandra!
<i>Sandra!</i>
<i>Margaret, did you
burn yourself here?</i>
No.
You weren't playing in any leaves,
maybe poison ivy?
Okay. Sleep tight.
Okay.
<i>16-Crash-21, Foothill.</i>
<i>A male white, thin
build, 20 to 25 years in a rear yard...</i>
I'm not saying that you did,
and I'm not saying that you didn't.
We do have ourselves a little situation
here, now don't we, Donald?
Sheriff, I don't know what happened
in that house tonight,
<i>but something attacked us, Sheriff.</i>
<i>And now something"s
wrong with my boy.</i>
It never looks good
for the husband, Donald.
<i>Look at him, Sheriff.
Look at him.</i>
<i>Marcus! Marcus, you stay near now.
We"re gonna need you.</i>
<i>Marcus!
Smitty, watch this guy.</i>
Marcus!
Marcus?
<i>Come on, son!</i>
I know you've seen some
scary things tonight, son,
<i>but if you come on back
we can help you.</i>
Marcus!
Come on in, son!
Marcus!
All right, son!
I'm gonna count to three.
You better come in
or you're gonna be in big trouble.
One...
two...
three!
<i>Sheriff.</i>
<i>- All right, son.
- Sheriff.</i>
<i>We"re gonna get ya.
- Sheriff.</i>
<i>Sheriff.</i>
Marcus?
Sheriff.
<i>- What was that?
- Oh, my God!</i>
<i>There"s a gate down there.</i>
<i>They went through here.</i>
<i>Okay, good idea.</i>
Grace?
Grace!
Grace!
What's the matter,
honey?
You feel okay?
You hot again?
Help me.
- Yaaah!
- Aaaaah!
Mrs. Nock?
We heard
about your trouble.
Something's wrong
with my boy.
Sandra's dead.
They think I did it.
I need a place to hide.
There's no need
to explain.
Ow!
Why do you need it?
Well, our machine will tell us
what the blood is made out of.
Gross.
Now let's see what this will do
for those little markings there.
- Ow!
- That doesn't hurt. It's supposed to feel good.
I don't like it.
- Did Mom ever tell you you had any allergies?
- No.
Well!
You two are in early.
Oh, she had some little rashes. I wanted
to get a look at them and take some blood.
Want me to take a peek?
Oh, I don't think it's anything.
It's probably just an allergy.
I'm gonna run her
to school.
So, how's your mother
holding up?
She's gettin' there. The medication seems
to help, and the house is shaping up.
Have you considered
coming back?
Oh, Doc, I just want to handle this
thing with Mom. Then I can think.
Enough said.
<i>Police are still
searching for Donald Atkins.</i>
<i>He"s wanted for questioning regarding
the bizarre double murder...</i>
<i>of his wife and
Sheriff Biggs last night.</i>
<i>Atkins fled the crime scene
and shortly afterward...</i>
<i>police discovered the body of
the sheriff in a nearby cornfield.</i>
<i>Apparently, the sheriff was searching
for the couple"s son, Marcus.</i>
<i>At the moment, there is no sign
of either father or son.</i>
<i>Police are asking
that anyone...</i>
<i>with any information on the two
contact them immediately.</i>
Oh. Janet.
I'm sorry, Dr. Robbie, but
they've been acting so strangely.
<i>Ever since they got sick,
they just won"t listen to me.</i>
I thought they were teasing me,
you know, but I don't...
How're you doin' there,
Scott?
I'm not Scott.
Oh, then you
must be Scott.
- I'm Zeke.
- I'm Caleb.
<i>I told them to stop. They just won"t
quit, Doc. What do you think it is?</i>
What I think it is
is they're pulling your leg,
and I think you're about
to collapse from exhaustion.
Now, go on home and get you some sleep.
I'll keep them here tonight.
<i>- Are you sure?
- I will keep an eye on them.</i>
<i>I don"t want to see you back here
"til you"ve had ten solid hours.</i>
Okay.
Well, now. All right.
You want to tell me what's
going on here, Charlie?
I'm not Charlie.
Do you boys know
how old I am?
<i>Well... I"m pretty old.</i>
I've lived here in Grand Isle
my entire life.
I was around during
the Second World War.
I was around during the Depression.
<i>Did you know that?</i>
But when I was a boy here,
there was a set of twins...
a couple years older
than I was.
They weren't bad boys,
but they had a lot of...
bad things and sad things
in their lives.
<i>Do you know
what I"m getting at?</i>
Ezekiel and Caleb Cuff.
Do you know what happened
to the Cuff boys?
They were killed
by their father.
One of them was shot...
and the other
was cut with a knife.
Do you think
that is a funny thing?
It is not.
And I don't think your little joke
is a funny thing, either.
I'm going to suggest
to your mother...
that she blister
your little behinds...
real good.
You understand me, Scott?
I'm not Scott.
I take the pills.
I do. I take them.
But it just gets worse.
Shhh.
It'll be okay, Mom.
It will.
The dream is getting worse, Grace.
I close my eyes...
and he's there.
The boy is there.
I told you to wait out front,
young man.
Where is your brother?
In bed.
It's too late for that.
<i>You boys have been
looking for trouble,</i>
and now you are going
to get it!
<i>Doc!</i>
All right, boys.
That's enough!
Boys!
Boys!
Yaaaaaah!
He's back.
Oh, my God!
Hello?
Doc?
I don't want to hurt you.
The kids. Where are the kids?
You were testing them.
You saw Marcus Atkins. Where is he?
He's gone.
Disappeared with the sheriff.
Something was wrong
with him.
He saw what had happened.
He was in shock.
Wait a minute.
You murdered Sandra.
No, I didn't kill her! Something happened
in the house. Something happened to Marcus.
<i>He was sick.
They were all sick.</i>
It was just a virus,
but it's gone now.
<i>- It did something to him. The fever.
- No, that's impossible.</i>
Then why are you here?
<i>What is that?</i>
Blood tests
for my sister.
<i>- What does it say?
- I don"t know. L"m not a doctor.</i>
What does it say?
The readings
don't make any sense.
There must have been something
wrong with the machine.
<i>Something
is wrong with her.</i>
She has it too.
Whatever happened to my boy
is going to happen to her...
<i>and the rest of them,
all of them.</i>
All I want to do is find
my boy, bury my wife...
and get the hell out
of this godforsaken town.
Why do we have to
do it again? Ow.
The machine that analyzes blood didn't do
it right last time, so we needed some more.
But we don't like it.
Well, I had to do it too.
Okay, guys,
let's get you to school.
<i>Margaret, are you
feeling all right?</i>
James? James.
I can't get the door.
I can't get it.
Margaret, what's wrong?
I'm not Margaret.
What do you want?
I haven't seen you
around here.
What's your name?
Whew! My God,
you're hot!
You stay right here.
Damn!
<i>I remember a scripture...</i>
<i>that talked about the time
of Herod in the land of Canaan...</i>
<i>when the slaughter of the innocent children
of Israel ran the streets red with blood.</i>
<i>Red! Red!
Amen! Halleluiah!</i>
<i>According to God"s plan,
those children of Israel...</i>
We're going to see
the doctor right now, okay?
Margaret, look at me.
Jesus.
Something's wrong with my boy.
You said he was better.
- We're doing everything we can.
- His teeth are falling out. He's calling himself names.
- What's wrong?
- I've got a lot to do.
You're not a doctor.
I want to see Doc Rob.
So do I, but right now I'm all you've
got, so sit down and let me do my job.
Okay, now listen up. Mrs. Becker,
take room one. You're first.
Mrs. Amos, room two.
Mrs. Crandall, room three.
Mary Anne, get back here.
You're my new nurse.
Put this in your mouth
and bite on it.
Come on, Doc.
Where's Doc Rob?
I have complete chaos at the school.
There's no answer.
He must be on his way in.
I ran a blood test on her
that was totally off the scale.
And Margaret's teeth, she pulled out
every one of her fillings.
Grace.
I don't wanna be in charge when their heads
start doing 360's and they're hurling pea soup.
Get blood from these kids, give them
gauze to chew on and find Doc Rob.
James!
James?
Jamie?
Jamie?
<i>Mom?</i>
<i>Mom!</i>
Jamie?
Jamie?
<i>We"ll show Doc Rob
the blood tests and give you a call.</i>
<i>- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thanks for coming by.</i>
- What the hell is going on?
- That was County General.
<i>They"re sending out
the toxicology team in the morning.</i>
A voodoo doctor
might be a better idea.
I want to know
where the fuck Rob is!
And where are all the files
on these kids?
Every medical record
on a child is missing.
Doc Rob must've taken them. I'm gonna
take these results and go by his house.
<i>He"s an old man.
Maybe he kicked it.</i>
Grace, don't even
think about it.
<i>What?</i>
Mary Anne,
this blood sample...
Mine looks fine,
but the kid's is...
What is it?
Where are my boys?
Doc Rob has my boys.
I'm going to get them
right now.
Mary Anne, this blood is not
properly oxygenating.
It's decayed. It's like
it's mixed with something dead.
That's it. Check, please.
I'm out of here.
- Mary Anne, come on.
- No way, Grace! This shit is creeping me out big time!
Run the rest of those samples
and look for something chemical.
I'm going to Doc Rob's.
Come on, Margaret.
<i>Come on.
Get in the car.</i>
- Leave the child.
- Look, we have to find a doctor.
Leave the child.
You and I have someplace to go.
Margaret, you have to stay
with Mary Anne for now.
Okay, drive.
Let's go.
Mrs. Nock,
this is Grace.
I know who it is.
Come.
<i>Listen.</i>
Harvest moon's up.
Do you know
what that is?
<i>Traveling preachers.</i>
<i>Tent revivals.</i>
Old-time religion.
<i>Those preachers
wanted our money.</i>
And we wanted
to believe.
There was a boy...
that boy...
born of sin
to a young girl.
It was a scandal...
back then.
She up and left him.
One of those travelin'
preachers took him in.
So the boy took
to preachin'.
<i>Like it was in his blood.</i>
He had the gift,
he did.
We'd come from miles around
just to hear him.
<i>He"d scorch you with
the fear of hellfire,</i>
<i>then raise you up to Heaven,
that boy.</i>
They called him
Josiah.
Josiah, the amazing
boy preacher.
<i>Great crowds would
gather round to listen.</i>
<i>And he made them adult preachers
rich as kings, he did.</i>
But somethin' was wrong.
Summer after summer,
the tents
would come around,
and the boy was
still just a boy.
Oh, shit.
Every summer,
the amazing boy preacher
would be the same age,
the same size.
<i>They knew if he grew up,
the money would stop.</i>
So them wicked preachers...
<i>tried everything:
Kept him from sleep,</i>
fed him quicksilver...
poison.
<i>To stunt his growth,
but it didn"t work.</i>
But it just made
the boy crazy.
<i>Finally,</i>
they took the step.
<i>Gave him over.</i>
Wh... What do you mean,
"gave him over"?
<i>The darkness keptJosiah small.</i>
<i>But we learned the secret,
left the tents.</i>
Preachers didn't have
no use forJosiah no more,
<i>so they left him.</i>
<i>Like his mother done.</i>
He done them
preachers back good.
With a harvestin' scythe.
Up on the Spelling ranch.
<i>In the dark of night.</i>
Jesus Christ.
So we did
what we had to.
Townspeople...
dragged that boy
out of the house.
Dragged him out
to the cornfield...
and burned him up.
- And the boy cried.
- I could feel him.
<i>All through
the night...</i>
<i>I could still feel it.</i>
<i>Long after he should"ve been dead.</i>
<i>Next day we searched
the fields,</i>
<i>gathered every one
of the bones,</i>
the ashes.
And deep in a well...
<i>we sealed the soul
of that wicked boy preacher.</i>
He's found a child.
One like himself.
<i>And when that like child
takes his place,</i>
Josiah will take them all.
What do you mean,
"like child"?
Left. Abandoned.
<i>You must kill the boy.</i>
Send his spirit to hell!
Take back the like child!
<i>Don"t make my mistake!</i>
- Let's go.
- It all starts with a lie, girl.
- It all starts with a lie.
- Let's go.
Take back the child!
What is it?
What do you know?
This thing has got my boy.
You tell me what you know now.
Margaret is the like child.
I abandoned her and I lied to her.
Your sister?
She's my daughter.
Get in the fucking car.
Margaret, I think
it's time to go.
Margaret!
Margaret?
Margaret?
Margaret!
<i>- Grace!
- Oh, my God.</i>
Margaret!
- We have to find her! We've gotta get her back!
- Wait a minute. Hold on.
- Look. Look at this. What is this?
- It's mercurochrome ointment.
<i>Margaret hated it. That stuff and
fillings. They"re both made of mercury.</i>
- The boy. The boy was poisoned with quicksilver.
- Right.
Quicksilver is mercury.
Where's the
supply closet?
Rosa.
<i>It"s time.</i>
Your boy's come home.
I am Ezekiel and
I bring Him my flesh.
I am Caleb and
I bring Him my flesh.
<i>Let"s take the truck.</i>
No, no, no.
You drive.
By the looks of the moon,
we got about an hour.
<i>- Where are we going?
- Spelling farm.</i>
That's where he killed those preachers
and where the townspeople burned him.
Right, but what are we gonna do
when we get there?
I don't know, but I see
a lot of blood flowing.
And if my son gets as much as a cut
on him, he's gonna bleed to death.
Let's go.
I'm Herbert.
He comes with the blood
of children.
With my soul,
He will lead them.
What are you doing?
Spiking these shells
with mercury.
If this kid really hates this stuff, then this
oughta send him right back where he came from.
<i>Watch it!
Where the hell are you going?</i>
Short cut.
We bring Him our flesh.
We bring Him our flesh.
We bring Him our flesh.
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
We bring Him our flesh!
<i>We bring Him our flesh!</i>
<i>We bring Him our flesh!</i>
These two red ones, they're filled with
mercury. Use these on the bad kid.
The black ones,
they're regular 12-gauge, all right?
- And what do we use those for?
- I hope not to shoot children.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That's Marcus.
Grace, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
- What the fuck was that?

<i>Damn. I hope we brought
enough of this stuff.</i>

Hang in there.
Marcus, hang in there.
Don't die on me now.
Just hang in there, buddy.
This'll do it, okay?

<i>Hey, you"re gonna be all right.</i>
<i>You"re gonna be
all right.</i>

Come on, Margaret.
Come on.
Come on.
<i>Thank God.</i>
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I don't think those
are so funny anymore.
Well, I think she'd
be happy about that.
Come on.
Let's go.
<i>Okay, let"s say good-bye
to Marcus and Donald.</i>
<i>Take care of Mommy, you hear?</i>
- Thanks a lot, Grace.
- Thank you.
- Bye, Marcus.

<i>Mom, who will bring
our stuff to our new house?</i>
<i>That will be
the moving men.</i>
<i>It"ll be fun.</i>
