(BERLIN) Should we cover him?
- Just like that? We should ...
say a few words or something, right?
Our father who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
(RIO) Your kingdom come.
-What?
-You've skipped a paragraph.
After "hallowed be thy name"
comes ...
-What the hell does that matter now?
-If you want to pray,
you have to do right.
-Do you think God's gonna be there
watching if you say it right or wrong?
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive our debts, as we also have forgiven
our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
"There are times in life
when you should have
a damn remote control
to be able to pause it."
"Even if it was only five minutes."
"But sometimes things happen
with an irreverent obscenity
and nothing can be done to remedy it."
"On the one hand, we had just buried Moscow;
on the other, we were opening
the way to our freedom."
All shops in the area agree,
Inspector Murillo
he has commandeered recordings
of the security cameras
crucial to the investigation.
-The irrefutable proof
that she collaborates with the robbers.
-You have to activate
the intervention protocol, immediately.
Gather your best men.
-And what about the hostages?
And Alison Parker
and the international protocol,
What about citizen safety?
Colonel, they have large caliber weapons,
controlled access with explosives,
the hostages dressed in overalls and masks
matching the robbers.
We can not tell them apart.
If we enter, it'll be a slaughterhouse
and he knows it.
-What do you propose?
Allow these criminals escape
with Inspector Murillo
holding hands?
-Yes, let them out
and catch them once outside.
-Hum ...
-Do you know where victim's safetly
has taken us?
You want me to tell you?
To be the laughingstock.
But not only from Spain,
of all the fucking globe.
The news of half the world
that follow the robbery minute by minute
as if it was the World Cup.
Would you like to be on TV with the headline:
"The fools incompetents of the Spanish Police
let their escaped prisoner return
to the Mint Factory
on a motorbike"?
On a motorbike!
Do you like being to be
the world's buffoon?
-Sorry ...
-I did not ask for your opinion.
The Government has just given
the order to intervene.
Those bastards have been in there for 125 hours
and if, by any chance they escape,
the discredit of this country
It will be absolute.
-Sorry...
-"What?
-The attorney general has issued
an arrest warrant
for inspector Rachel Murillo.
From this moment
she's in search and capture.
Where is he?
-In the store room.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come, go.
The one on the cellphone.
Hi.
You can call her Stockholm,
if you want. (LAUGHS)
It's not all going to be crying, is it?
Let's go over there, you go.
(NAIROBI) 984 million euros.
984 millions euros
984 millions euros
(LAUGHS)
984 million euros.
-Yes.
Colonel, my men are ready to enter.
-All right.
-There are developments in the tunnel.
-The data of the georadar indicate
they're are a few meters away
from the sewerage network.
We have an elite unit
in the sewers.
-"Entering the main collector."
- Distance to the target:
300 meters north.
-Received. We're holding."
Suarez, we are going ahead with this operation
jointly. We'll employ an enveloping tactic
besiege them on the flanks to force them
to get in the hole.
Like a fucking sandwich.
-Push them from the inside to come out
and wait for them in the sewers,
so they can not go back
nor turtle back.
-We have them in a mousetrap
from which they can't leave.
Now we just have to find
the inspector Murillo
and her boy toy.
Lieutenant.
"Come on, come on, come on!"
(Talking)
(RADIO) "We have arrived".
Unit.
(ALL) Sir!
-Ready?
(ALL) Yes, sir!
Berlin, get everyone to transport the money,
we have to leave now.
(BERLIN) "Good".
Assault units are arriving
and they will enter.
-"Let's get on with it."
(RACHEL) We have already entered.
(SCREAMS)
(HELSINKI LAUGHS)
Motherfucker. Motherfucker!
Helsinki, I'm going to make your life miserable,
I swear to you. (SCREAMS)
As soon as I leave this place,
I'm going to file a lawsuit
you're going to shit, for cruelty,
torture and crimes against humanity,
Bastard!
(SHOUTS)
Little Arturo,
let's go to the tunnel.
Your mission is very important,
yes?
Yes.
It was fake.
It was fake.
Get up, slowly.
Turn around.
And now you're coming
to the police station.
And you're not going to move a fucking finger,
because this time
I'm really going to shoot you.
You know why?
Because after taking a walk
in the countryside
I had time to think and to regret
not having shot the biggest son of a bitch
that has crossed my path.
-Rachel, please.
And I'm not killing you now because
I want to see you 30 years in prison.
And over there you can ask to whoever
you pull out of your ass
what he's wearing.
(COCKS A GUN)
Do not move, still.
Freeze!
(KNOCK)
Be still!
(SHOOTS)
-Stay still!
He was born on The Day of the Worker.
All his birthdays,
since he started working in the mines,
he said he had the party already assembled,
a good picket.
And that (*police's) rubber balls
were his gifts.
But this year it's been real bullets.
I suppose if you are born on the wrong side,
you die on the wrong side.
What is your name?
No, Monica.
-I need to know your name.
Because I'm going to leave
here with you.
I don't know if through the back door,
through the tunnel or with a machine gun,
but I don't want to be away from you.
And if I have to learn to shoot,
then I'll learn.
Besides,
This child ...
This child is going to need a father.
Come on, tell me your name.
(WHISPERING VERY LOW) Ricardo.
(RADIO) "Here, subsoil team,
we keep moving forward
through the sewers."
(NOISES)
- "What's that noise?"
-"It's the subway, line six,
it's traveling above us".
-"We're continuing."
Come on, gentlemen,
don't let this decay!
Let it be known that here
we continue spreading magic til the end!
- Inside there we'll be having scrambled
radio signal and remote video,
"this way we will avoid
frequency inhibitors".
The explosives team will open a breach
in the cargo door,
300 grams of thermite explosive,
you know what that means.
So Lobo, Ruiz, you'll give us
cover fire if needed.
"The rest will enter in a row
one by one,
no one is left behind."
(BERLIN) Come on, come on, come on!
- Gentlemen, in there
we're gonna find a wild party
"So let's be united, together."
Agree?
(ALL) Yes, sir!
-The only slogan is not to shoot first
if they're wearing masks.
"But for sure,
we'll return anyone's fire"
against us.
-The only slogan
is that there is no order
that none of those bastards
get out alive.
It is clear?
-It is clear?
(ALL) Yes, sir!
We are ready,
so let's go for them.
"Come on, come on, come on!"
Stop the machines and delete all the records.
Then remove the hard drives,
we're taking them.
-We are very close to reach a billion.
All we need is print a few plates and that's it.
How much time do we need, Torres?
-11 minutes.
-11 minutes.
-You are rounding the figure, Nairobi.
What do you think this is?
"Let's make a deal"?
-Go pack your bags,
I'll take care of the money.
If I say "a billion,"
it'll be a billion.
-And if I say you stop,
you stop!
Do you know why I am in charge?
Because your head is full of butterflies.
You want to stay in this mousetrap
just to reach a billion.
Do you know what that reminds me of?
Of a mother who leaves her child,
a baby, to go sell some pills.
And she gets caught, of course.
And the child is taken away.
Under my command those things
won't happen, Nairobi.
-No, no, weddings with hostages are planned
under your command.
So you're getting married on the beach,
dressed in white?
And you who controls everything,
do you know what that woman feels for you?
Makes her throw up.
I've heard it in the bathroom.
Her only consolation she has left
is to keep all your money.
Hold on until I get a stroke
and, when you're dying,
tell it to your face
that every time you raped her,
because you are raping her,
she went to the bathroom to vomit.
That's all she has left,
to spit on your deathbed.
That's what you have made of her.
-Torres, turn off the machines.
- Miss Nairobi?
-Turn off the machines, Torres.
-Understood.
Rio. Rio, are you there?
(RIO)-"Yes, professor."
The frequency is encrypted.
How long would it them
to decode it?
-"At least two hours."
Perfect.
Place the explosive charges.
Pass the walkie to Berlin.
-"Right now".
(RACHEL) Eh.
Please come.
Tell me.
I'm not feeling well.
What's wrong?
-My chest hurts a lot.
It could be an anxiety attack,
do you want an anxiolytic?
(SCREAMS)
It would have been much easier for me too
if none of this had happened.
You've been the only one ... the only real
fissure in a perfect plan,
a plan that was perfect and no longer is.
You know why?
Because, even if all this ends well,
Even if all this goes well, I'm already
...going to be fucked up.
Because I'm not going to see you again.
Do you think it that was my plan
fall in love with the inspector
in charge of the case?
I don't want to listen to you anymore.
You Don't you want to liste to me?
Why don't you want to listen to me, Rachel?
Because I am one of the bad guys?
You've been lectured to see everything
in terms of good and bad.
But this we are doing
it seems good to you only if other people do it
In the year 2011 the European Central Bank
created 171 billion euros from nothing.
From nothing.
The same as what we are doing now.
Only on a large scale.
185 billion in 2012
145 billion euros in 2013.
Do you know where all that money went?
To the banks.
Directly from the factory ...
to the pockets of the richest.
Did anyone say that the European Central Bank
was a thief?
"Liquidity injection", they called it.
And they made out of thin air, Rachel,
out of nowhere.
What is this?
This is nothing, Rachel,
this is paper.
It's paper, you see?
Just paper.
I am doing a "Liquidity injection".
But not to the bank,
I'm doing it here,
to the real economy of this group of losers,
which is what we are, Rachel.
To escape from all this.
Don't you also want to escape?
(Cell phone)
Angel is calling you.
What does this mean,
that he has awakened?
If he's conscious, he'll send our colleagues
and they're going to show up in five minutes, fuck.
Okay, alright, I'm going to pick up
and you're going to answer, Rachel,
but no nonsense.
Please, please.
You are going to answer and
you are going to make sure
if he has woken up, okay?
Please.
Please.
No, no, don't pick up.
Don't pick up.
My phone is tapped.
Do you have another?
(Mobile vibrating)
Who is it?
-Rachel, Rachel Murillo.
-"Angel has awakened, he doesn't want us
to call anyone
before talking to you. I'll put him on."
(ANGLE) Raquel
-(CRYING)
How are you?
- (CRYING)
-"Hey, stay calm"
"Come on".
Easy.
"Come on, Rachel."
-How are you?
-Me? So high I can't feel my own ass.
(LAUGH)
Listen, I've seen on television
that you have been relieved
from the case.
-Yes.
-Don't tell anyone that I woke up, okay?
I need you to come see me first.
-Okay.
Colonel, we have detected a call to
Raquel Murillo's cell phone,
but there was no communication.
-Locate
the origin of this call.
I want the caller's name
and the cell tower, right now.
You have to let me go talk to Angel.
If not, in 15 minutes
he'll talk to the police
and he'll tell them where you are.
I can prevent him from doing it.
It is your only chance.
Please.
It's about your plan,
so your perfect plan
doesn't go down the drain.
-Let me think, please.
There is nothing to think.
Sergio.
I'm with you.
A minute ago you were screaming
and biting me like an animal.
Can I trust you?
-Come closer.
(BREATHES RAPIDLY)
Colonel.
We have the call to Rachel.
It was made from Angel's phone.
-What?
-Deputy Inspector Rubio.
- Call the hospital and find out
if he's woken up from the coma.
If so, send three men right fucking now.
That bitch can appear over there at any time.
Well, that's it, timers and photo cells in place.
This will keep the police entertained for a while,
they'll have to deactivate them one by one.
What plans do you have for tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow I will be sailing in a merchant,
sunbathing with my tits hanging.
With your tits hanging ...
So that I don't get bikini lines.
And you're going to be there,
topless,
with all those lonely sailors
who have not seen a woman
in three months.
You think I don't know how to defend
myself or what?
Or do you want to defend me from the bystanders?
No, is not that.
-It's not?
That cruise will be our last trip.
And I don't know what the hell you'll do
once we reach the port.
I don't know if you're going to ride a jet ski
and start shooting around (*guns) or
what the hell you're gonna do, I don't know.
So I want you to stay still,
right next to me. And in my cabin.
(LAUGHS)
Hey, we just ran into a brick wall.
Hold.
Open that wall, it connects to the sewer.
That's where we're exiting from.
Go.
Here.
Have you seen all those bombs?
Fuck.
20 years of my life, 20 years.
Jesus, give me the hammer.
(RADIO) "We are 200 meters from the outfall"
"Estimated time: six minutes.
-"Received, we'll notify of any seismic movement".
Berlin, stop the chain right now.
Nairobi, we're leaving.
-There is still money to be taken.
-We are overbooked already.
Gentlemen, it has been a pleasure to rob you,
but it is time to enjoy a well-deserved vacation.
(PA)
Rachel.
-How are you?
-You can see.
-I'm glad you came out of this.
I think I owe you an apology.
-Shush. Stop apologizing.
Although those things you called me
before "bingo playboy" and Mr. Potatohead
It was the most humiliating thing
anybody told me in my fucking life.
(LAUGHS)
I could not rest easy in the coma.
I'm so sorry.
-Why have you been relieved of the case?
-Because they think I belong
to that band of robbers.
-And do you belong?
-"No."
-But you had a relationship
with that guy, right?
-Yes.
-And you're in love with him.
I'll give you the information
of where the hangar is.
From where that guy controls all the robbery.
In case you want to clean up your reputation,
Solve the case and beat them
(*to the punch).
-I know where the hangar is.
But I'm not going to give them the information.
-Why?
-Because I don't know
who the good guys are anymore
and who are the bad guys
-Freeze!
-Hands up!
-Raise your hands.
-Lopez.
Arenas
Gomez
Ah!
Angel...
(BEEP)
You know there will be rules
on our island, right?
You have to be butt naked all day,
although I can use loincloths.
Go and put explosives in the warehouse, go.
(BEEP)
Tokyo!
(Distant shots)
Advance
(RIO) Let's go, fuck!
My weapon!
On the right, fuck!
Oh!
(SHOUTS)
Go!
Come on, fuck!
What the fuck we do?
(SHOUT)
Fucking armored shields.
You have to shoot at their feet.
Cover me!
Sons of bitch!
-Major, recount!
-Several agents have been hit, sir!
I'll cover you.
(SHOUTS)
-Evacuate the wounded, come on!
We evacuated the wounded and continue!
If we get out of here, I quit using submachine guns,
I swear.
-Really?
I'm not touching a single shotgun again
not even at a community fair.
(SHOUTING)
-Come on! With all we got!
Also, we'll have to choose things
for our island, right?
Curtains, sofas ...
-Our island you said?
Sons of bitches!
(SUAREZ) Go, go, go
With all we got. Let's go.
Fuck. Lobo, now!
They're coming. Fuck.
Let's move on!
Let's go!
Come on, come on.
"Come on, come on, come on!"
Fuck.
-Come on.
You have to reach that door.
-Halt fire, do not shoot!
Hannibal.
-What?
-Keep under cover.
Give me your tags
-My proposal dogtags?
-One, two ... Now.
Take cover!
(SHOUTS)
Take cover!
(BOTH)
I love you.
There I go.
-Now!
Come on!
-Tokyo!
Tokyo!
Tokyo!
Tokyo.
-You are stopped, still!
Rio rio.
-No, do not shoot!
-Get away from her, hands up!
(DENVER)
Rio, down, down!
(SCREAMS)
Shit!
Shit, fuck!
(SHOUTS)
We're leaving now!
Run Run Run!
-Lobo, Ruiz! How are you?
Ruiz, fuck! We're evacuating Ruiz!
Rio, Denver!
(RIVER) Coming, coming.
-What?
Go fetch the Browning,
see you in the vault.
Agreed.
Come on!
(RIO) Come on, fuck.
(SHOUTS)
-Regroup and continue, now!
Let's go get them!
Yes sir.
I hand him over.
The CNI (*CIA) has taken control.
It's Colonel Prieto.
-Angel, how are you?
-Well, I've been better some Christmas,
to be honest.
-Hey, I'm curious, why did you call
Inspector Murillo as soon as you woke up?
Because... we're friends.
- (LAUGHS) Don't fuck with me. Come on, tell me,
why did she come to see you?
-She came 'cos we're friends.
-She humiliated you like a piece of shit
in front of the whole team
and she almost ended your career
and your life,
so stop playing with my balls
with that "she's my friend" crap.
"I'll repeat the question, Angel."
Why did you call Inspector Murillo?
-(FIRM)
Because she's my friend.
-You were in the hiding place of that guy,
the Professor,
"I know you took a teaspoon from his lair
and you gave it to the CSI to analyze it."
Tell us the address.
-I don't remember anything.
I don't remember a fucking shit.
-I see.
You know that any information
that you hide from us
will make you incur a crime for cover-up.
"You may end up sharing a cell with the kidnappers"
or with your "friend".
"Tell us the address."
-"Prieto".
You really know how to treat a guy
who just came out of a coma.
(SUAREZ) Let's go, go, go
nobody is left behind
Everyone put on the masks!
They've gotten inside.
-We have to take the Browning
to the #3 vault.
-Denver is working on it.
What do we do with the hostages?
-Deliver them.
Everybody scrambled, turn your backs
and on your knees, now!
Come on!
Well, not everybody.
Ariadne comes with me.
Let's go, Helsinki!
They are in the museum.
(SUAREZ) Atention,
hands up in the air where I can see them
Everyone, hands up!
-Don't shoot, we're hostages!
-Everyone, take the masks off!
(PRIETO) They are hostages.
-They're hostages,
get them out now!
-Rescue protocol prepared,
we are releasing hostages.
-SUAREZ, continue with the plan,
go to the basement.
We have to make them go out through the tunnel.
-You two, with them.
The rest, with me, to the basement!
Let's go already!
We have Parker.
(Applauses)
Put me with the ambassador.
Get a headcount and identification
of the hostages.
(RADIO) "Colonel, we're moving
through the basement."
Open up
What the hell is that?
-Let the TEDAX (*bomb squad) advance.
The basement is full of explosives.
-What the fuckers.
Can you deactivate them?
-Yes, but I need time, sir.
The detonator could be very close to the RDX,
there may be boobytrap wires.
"My men are detecting
movement in the tunnel, sir.
(RADIO) "Reaching the goal".
"They're on the other side of the wall."
-Five, five robbers.
No, wait, there are six robbers.
-It's them.
-They are about to leave through
hole into the sewer.
-Subground agents, get ready,
you have them on top.
-"Received".
-We got you, sons of bitches.
-In six seconds.
Five, four, three,
two, one.
-Stand, hold on.
Stay
Don't shoot!
-Hands up!
Don't shoot, please,
don't shoot!
Move that light away!
"Don't shoot, I'm Arturo Roman!"
-They're hostages, don't shoot!
-Confirmed, they are hostages.
-Fuck!
It's possible I may not always known
how to read women,
Maybe because I'm egocentri.
But with you it's different,
I know perfectly how you feel.
I know that even if there was no money,
you'd come with me to the end of the world,
because you're completely in love,
right?
-Yes.
-That's why I want you to know
that I love you too.
-Berlin, hurry!
-And what little time we have left ...
It's going to be fireworks.
(LAUGHS)
(HELSINKI MUMBLES TO HIMSELF)
-Marvellous toy.
Wonder of a toy, Helsinki!
Nairobi, how's that going?
-The trench is in place.
Only the last batch of money remains.
Helsinki! Lets go!
-Come on, hurry.
Colonel, they have another tunnel.
What?
-They're taking the money to the vault.
We've seen it.
-They digged a hole in the ground and
they're taking everything out thru there.
-Come closer.
There are four vaults,
two on each side of the corridor.
Could you tell me which one it is,
could you point it out on the map?
-Vault number three.
-Are you sure, Alison?
-Yes.
-Suarez, Suarez, do you copy?
-"I hear you, sir."
-Change of plan, vault #3,
Maximum priority.
I repeat, highest priority.
"They have a tunnel there."
-Received, Colonel.
To the #3 vault,
come on, come on, come on!
Do they have any idea
where that tunnel ends?
-They don't know, but I do.
They are taking the money to the hangar
from where the fucking Professor speaks.
And they're thinking to flee from there.
Bring Inspector Murillo now!
-Gomez, we need Inspector Murillo
right here, immediately.
Are you going to fetch your son
when you get out?
"No, not at the moment.
I no longer have a plan
-We can share a flat.
-Helsinki
(LAUGHS)
-Let's go now, now!
They are in the basement.
-Come on, come on, get out now!
And Denver?
They are on their way to the hangar.
I said leave.
That's an order.
-Let's move on.
-Berlin, let's go.
Berlin, they are coming down the stairs,
you have them right on top.
OK, got it.
They know where we are, you leave.
-Let's go now or won't leave anymore.
-Helsinki, take Nairobi.
I'll hold on.
-What you mean you'll hold?
-I said leave!
If they enter the tunnel,
we're all dead.
-What are you doing, Berlin?
-Someone has to stay
in the trench.
-Don't.
-Yes, they're on our heels!
-Then we all leave together!
-Nairobi...
You and I agreed that I was
a misogynist, right?
Well, women and queers first.
-Let's go.
-I hate you.
Let's go?
-I hate you!
-Come on.
Go Go.
I want everyone in your position, come on.
Eh eh.
Eh eh...
Where are you going, honey?
-(WHINNING)
-We agreed that you and me, here, together
'til the end.
"No!
(CRYING) Berlin, please.
No no. Let me out, let me out!
Fuck, let me out!
-Quiet!
-You're a bastard!
You bastard, son of a bitch!
-You and I are the resistance.
You look like crap.
Where is the hangar?
I don't know.
-Not only you know where the hangar is,
but you know perfectly
that I know you know,
so let's skip this part.
Large caliber, take cover!
(SCREAMS)
We have to go back.
-No, Nairobi, no.
There's no time, let's go, let's go.

Right now you catch me in a bit of a mess.
Get in the tunnel.
(ARIADNE SCREAMS)
-Negative!
Andres, we're gonna blow the tunnel,

I have them on me, it's too late.
-Advance!
-Leave now!
I'm not going to leave
without you, you know that.
Cartridge.
(SUAREZ) Let's go.
Decay is not made for me.
Can you imagine me drooling over
or losing control
of my sphincters?
No, it takes courage for that.
I prefer this.
Get out, please.
-Sergio, don't fuck with me!
You promised me that you would not stay
if things got ugly.
And they've gotten ugly.
Helsinki ..., blow the tunnel.
No, no.
Down!
Helsinki, it's an order!
Soldier, blow the tunnel!
No, do not do it.
Helsinki, it's an order!

(TV) "It's the one year anniversary
of the assault to the National Factory
of Currency and Stamps, the one considered
the biggest heist
in history is still unresolved. "
"Just as the whereabouts
of the robbers is unknown,
who got away with a bounty of more than
one billion euros."
"Although, of course, the forces of the law
condemned the coup, much of public opinion
continues to see their actions as legitimate,
as a form of protest against
the established order,
generating an intense debate
in social networks".
"One of the most notorious cases
was that of the inspector in charge
in those days, Raquel Murillo,
who's since left the Corps
after some controversial statements
to the media in which
she showed her disagreement
with the way the crisis was managed
by the National Intelligence Office (*CIA)."
