THE MAGlClAN
- Well?
- What?
- Find what you were digging for?
- Nothing.
Aunt with her mandrake
and sliced fingers and other mischief.
Oh, yes. And ghosts walked sighing
and wailing in the forest -
- so people didn't dare enter after
the sun had set. l remember well.
- Aunt and her ghosts!
- Why have Tubal as an assistant?
You should throw him out.
Do you hear what grandmother says?
How would Vogler's Magnetic Health
Theatre manage without Tubal?
l only ask. For example,
who got us out of Copenhagen?
At night? At risk to his own life?
After our Danish tour went to hell?
- l ask, but no one answers...
- And who boils our medicine?
Aunt would have been killed long ago
if people knew what she put in it.
What is healthy isn't always tasty,
my mother said.
- l take responsibility, anyway.
- And the profits.
Don't try, Aunt.
Because l know something, me!
Did you hear? There was a scream.
l heard it perfectly clearly.
- lt's a fox.
- A fox?!
A fox on two thin legs, bloody and
maybe with a head hanging by sinew.
A fox without eyes,
and with a rotten hole for a mouth.
Oh yes, l've seen them...
l know what l know.
Damned if l'll sit on that seat and
have ghosts wailing around my ears.
Gash in the eye, blood in the
mouth, fingers gone, broken neck.
He calls you down, he calls you out,
beyond the dead -
- the living, the living dead,
beyond the raised hands...
No... Good day, Sire.
My name is Johan Spegel.
l am very ill, as you can see.
Would you alleviate my suffering
and give me a little vodka?
As vodka is my illness,
but also its remedy.
l am an actor...
...and am actually a member
of the famous Stenborg Troupe.
But my illness
has terminated my career.
Are you also an actor?
Why are you made up?
You wear a false beard and your
eyebrows are coloured as is your hair.
Are you a swindler who needs
to conceal his real face?
Let's rest a moment... and breathe.
Dusk is falling...
And this is the final day of life.
l always longed for a knife...
A blade that would
expose my entrails.
Release my brain and my heart...
Free me from my substance...
Cut away my tongue...
and my sex.
A sharp blade...
...that purged all impurity.
Then the so-called spirit...
...would rise up and out
of this meaningless cadaver.
- What book are you reading, Sire?
- A novel. lt's about cheats.
- Colleagues?
- There are no cheats here.
- No?
- lt's nevertheless an interesting book.
''Deception is so generally common
that he who tells the truth'' -
- ''as a rule is classed
as the greatest liar.''
The author presumes a large general
truth somewhere in the backdrop.
- lt's an illusionary theory.
- So much for your reading, Mr Aman.
- Mr Tubal should talk after chewing.
- Truth interests me in a devilish way.
lt's a beautiful passion.
lf l say one's bottom is behind
and one's head on the neck -
- then that's an absolute truth,
and l like truths like that.
Bottom behind
and head on the neck?
- lt's a doubtful truth.
- l don't understand.
Well, it appears
to be the reverse with you.
- You're droll, it's sad you'll die.
- You will too, but don't believe it.
A question for the future, Sire, and the
future is as uninteresting as the past.
l'm a lily in the soil, can't you see?
He dies now.
You wish to record
the actual moment.
Look carefully, Sire.
l will keep my face open -
- to your curiosity.
What do l feel? Fear...
...and well-being.
Now death has reached my hands...
...my arms... feet...
...belly...
Now l can no longer see.
l am dead.
You wonder... l will tell you...
Death is...
That was an interesting
piece of information.
Ruined, suspected, wanted by the
police and with a body in the coach!
We couldn't make
a better entrance into the capital.
VOGLER'S MAGNETlC
HEALTH THEATRE
You remain silent and l'll talk.
Above all l must ask Aunt
to keep her trap shut.
One more thing.
Aunt can make things jump.
Aunt knows what l mean. Tables fly,
chairs fall, lights go out, etc.
We know Aunt's tricks.
But be nice now and behave.
- For all of our sakes.
- Yes, l understand.
- Perhaps.
- That old bag makes me nervous.
- Remember what you did in Ostend?
- No, just think, l can't remember.
Aunt's tricks are obsolete. They're
no fun as they can't be explained.
- Aunt ought to be dead.
- Yes, it was festive in Ostend.
l was thrown inside, Vogler was fined
and Aunt was flogged in the square.
Yes, it was festive in Ostend.
- We should introduce ourselves.
- Of course.
l am Consul Abraham Egerman,
welcome to my house.
l and particularly my wife, have a
special interest in spiritual questions.
Therefore we've asked Commissioner
Starbeck to gather here.
Frans Starbeck, Police Commissioner.
l'm responsible for our meeting.
l hope my men have behaved and
proceeded with necessary tact.
Vergerus, Medical Councillor.
lt only seems right that we in our turn
introduce ourselves.
Firstly, the company's leader
and director, Albert Emanuel Vogler.
A big name on the continent.
Mr Vogler has, in an ingenious way -
- developed and perfected
the science of animal magnetism.
Happy to make
Mr Vogler's acquaintance.
This, gentlemen, is Mr Vogler's young
ward and foremost pupil, Mr Aman.
He's displayed
the most unusual talents.
This venerable old lady
is Mr Vogler's grandmother.
Once a celebrated opera singer.
Who does not recall
Countess Agata de Macopazza?
l am insignificant in this gathering. My
humbleness has found its life's task -
- in serving the great spirit that bears
the name, Albert Emanuel Vogler.
Does Dr Vogler object to sitting down
awhile and discussing -
- general questions
in relation to the enterprise?
Well... Please be seated.
Dr Vogler. You have announced an
entertainment in the town chronicle -
- brimming with a range
of sensations.
''Astounding,
never before witnessed curiosities.''
''Magical acts
derived from Oriental philosophy.''
''Health inducing magnets. Nerve
stimulation. Mind animation.''
- ls this your announcement?
- Commissioner.
These ostentatious formulations
are not the work of Dr Vogler's hand.
We'd be grateful if the doctor himself
would answer the question.
Mr Vogler is deprived
of the gift of speech.
He is dumb, gentlemen.
Perhaps Mr Aman
is also deprived of the gift of speech?
- l haven't heard you say anything.
- l haven't been asked, Commissioner.
- You undertake magical seances?
- We haven't claimed that.
- Your friend, Mr Tubal...
- We use devices, mirrors, projections.
- lt's simple and perfectly harmless.
- Another question...
- Mr Vogler cures illnesses?
- We haven't said that.
Mr Vogler recently, using
another name, toured Denmark.
He made an appearance as a doctor
and received patients in inns.
''Patients were magnetised according
to Mesmer's principles in a dim room.''
''This resulted in quaking and nervous
attacks of various types.''
''Some fainted.''
Why do you ask
what you already know?
There seems to be a remarkable
division in Mr Vogler's activities.
- What do you mean?
- There's the idealistic Dr Vogler...
...who practices medicine according
to Mesmer's doubtful methods.
Then there's the less tasteful notion
of Vogler the conjuror -
- who performs all sorts of hocus
pocus from homemade formulas.
lf l understand it, Vogler's activities
range without scruples -
- between these two... extremes.
Tell me. Do you consider
you possess supernatural powers?
This incomprehensible interrogation
is hurtful to both parties.
- Hold us if we've acted illegally...
- That's what we intend to find out.
- Forgive me, l didn't know.
- Sit down, my dear child.
Gentlemen, may l present my wife.
Mr Vogler, l must apologise. What
has emerged so far in this matter -
- hardly inspires confidence.
Bring the lamp
on the table over there.
Hold it like this.
Look at me, Mr Vogler.
Why do you look so infuriated, Mr
Vogler? You've no reason to hate me.
l simply want to ascertain the truth.
That should also be your wish.
Open your mouth.
Stick out your tongue.
l'm sorry, Mr Vogler. Your
dumbness seems to be inexplicable.
ln your advertisement
it states further -
- that you ''evoke stimulating and
terrible visions amongst those present.''
Commissioner,
that's our Laterna Magica.
- A silly and harmless plaything.
- l'm not sure it concerns that.
- Do you evoke visions?
- l protest.
- Why may l ask?
- Dr Vogler is a great man.
A great man and a prominent scientist.
You're treating him like a charlatan.
lt's rather the surroundings that cast
a shadow on his scientific merit.
- Do you evoke visions?
- Silence or l'll send you out!
Well, Mr Vogler? Yes or no.
Yes or no.
So, yes... Can you achieve this
condition with whoever it may be?
With me, perhaps?
Let's do an experiment.
l'm at your disposal.
- No, don't do it.
- And why not, Mrs Egerman?
Forgive me.
No additional arrangement? No
magnets, no mysterious half light?
No secretive music performed on a
glass harmonica behind the curtain?
What do you want me to see?
Something frightening or exciting?
lt must be with broken reed.
Broken reeds, weak souls.
You're overexerting yourself.
Careful, stop your attempt.
You think l hate you. Mistake. There
is only one thing that interests me.
Your physiology, Mr Vogler.
l'd like to perform an autopsy on you.
Weigh your brain -
- open your heart, do a little research
on your nervous system.
Remove your eyes...
Stop before it is too late!
Too late? Tedious you mean.
You have failed, Mr Vogler. But
you should be grateful for your fiasco.
- You are harmless.
- Why are you lying?
- l don't understand, Mrs Egerman.
- We see you're lying.
You felt something that terrified you,
but you don't dare say what it was.
Sorry, Mrs Egerman, l have nothing
to hide, no prestige to maintain.
Who knows, perhaps l regret
l wasn't able to feel anything?
Everything well, then. lt's just the
Police Commissioner's permission -
- that's needed so that you can hold
your ''magnetic entertainment''.
- Mr Commissioner...
- Mr Vogler will perform privately...
...tomorrow morning
in Mr Egerman's drawing-room.
As a form of control.
ln broad daylight.
Do you have any objections,
Mr Tubal? Excellent.
- Supper will be served in an hour.
- lt is an honour...
l'm sorry. Mr Vogler and company
will be fed in the kitchen.
Mrs Garp will assign you quarters.
Rustan, show the guests the kitchen.
- Perhaps we'd rather stay in town.
- lt is the Commissioner's wish...
...that Mr Vogler and company
be guests of the house.
- That was quite an amusing game.
- What do you mean?
lt's amusing to humiliate
defenceless people.
You misunderstand. We have a wager,
it's a question of scientific interest.
- You have a wager?
- Yes, Mrs Egerman.
Your husband is of the opinion that
there really are inexplicable forces.
- And you deny that possibility?
- lt would be catastrophic for science.
- A grotesque thought.
- lt would lead to us being forced to...
- Logically we'd have to imagine...
- A God.
Totally out-of-date! Science is better
equipped today than ever -
-...to penetrate all apparent mysteries.
- Apparent?
- Everything can be explained.
- You're optimistic.
- Think of electricity, steam engines...
- Our wager holds, then?
We'll see tomorrow.
Your wife appears
a little tense, Egerman.
- ls it the child's death that still...
- We're travelling in autumn and l...
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- To Dr Vogler's magnetic company.
A company with an exceptionally
bad conscience, it appears.
l think they're people to watch out for.
They look awful.
- You're too young to understand.
- The magician is dumb, that's awful.
- He hasn't said a word.
- Rustan says he's pretending.
That's even more awful.
l'm really afraid.
They haven't got any money anyway.
You only need to fear wealthy people.
lt's awful they're poor. What if they
kill us and steal the master's money?
Good evening, young maids.
My name is simply Tubal,
it's as simple as a folk song.
Let's see now.
That's Sara and this is Sanna.
- ls that how it is?
- l know. That's Sanna. This is Sara.
- Do you think so?
- Time will tell.
Put simply, we're invited to dinner.
There are the preparations and here
are the guests. Shall we sit down?
- My lady...
- Sofia Garp, the house cook.
l am charmed, flattered, overwhelmed,
not to mention enchanted...
Delighted. Charmed.
- Can you tell fortunes, Mr Tubal?
- Mr Tubal can tell fortunes.
- Read my palm, Mr Tubal.
- My dear little child.
You're far too young and hopeful.
l don't want to muddy your curiosity -
- your joy of life, your childish faith.
One really senses Mr Tubal's
supernatural powers.
- l can feel it, l can feel it.
- A wonderful gift.
But hard to bear, Sofia, and dark...
Gracious, Mr Tubal! lt makes one
really hot under the corset.
- And cold, too.
- Mr Tubal, read my palm anyway.
- This is Antonsson, the coachman.
- Mild servant Antonsson. We've met.
- Evening.
- Quiet. He will talk of the future.
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet...
l see a light.
Now it's been turned off. lt's dark.
l hear sweet words of love.
No l can't repeat them,
my sense of propriety forbids me.
A young man. He's riding
at full gallop. lt's wonderful.
Sara, my child. Before you go
and celebrate your feast of love -
- take a few drops of our love potion.
You'll enjoy it sevenfold more.
lt's a gift from Aphrodite Venus.
- Tubal is just the simple bearer.
- A love potion!
- ls it expensive, Mr Tubal?
- lt's well-nigh impossible to procure.
- And under extraordinary hardship.
- That you dared!
ln the name of science. Of love...
- Would you allow me to buy a bottle?
- lt's impossible.
Your means are far too modest,
Sofia.
These potions are only affordable
for princesses -
- countesses and one
or the other leading actress.
But for you Sofia, for your beauty,
your great hospitality -
- your courtesy, let's say thirteen
shillings. Two bottles for twenty!
Aah, it smells strong.
So strong, so strong...
lt's the actual fluid, my child.
The stimulus materialised -
-...if l express myself scientifically.
- ls it good for men too?
Not only. Aphrodite Venus touches
their hearts with her fingertips...
- And the devil is loosed!
- God in heaven, if mother was here!
The love potion is finished.
What do we use now?
This is for colic
and blistered feet.
The most important thing is what
the bottle looks like and the taste.
- Tubal is naturally a swindler.
- Yes, of course, Sofia.
- But l have something special, not so?
- l was just thinking of that.
- You'd be a good preacher.
- My faith wavers.
Perhaps you're right. The matter
requires a private discussion.
l'll go to my room. Go into the yard,
then around the house to the right.
There's a little door there.
l'll let you in.
- You're a woman, Sofia!
- Perhaps.
My husband died eight years ago.
- Don't you want the bottles?
- Keep your bottles.
You can sell them again.
Get married... to Sofia.
Hallelujah brothers and sisters!
Conceivable. The main thing isn't faith,
but the power. Sofia felt the power.
- What can l get for this shilling?
- A night of love you'll never forget.
- No, that's rat poison.
- That one will be hard to kill!
Drink it in one gulp and you'll feel
bliss greater than Solomon -
- when he amused himself
with his 1 ,000 concubines.
- Why is the little one crying?
- Are you a witch?
That may be so.
l'm so scared of what's going on
tonight. You're so old and ugly.
When you are almost 200 years old,
you will also be ugly, little one.
- Are you so old?
- Oh yes...
- Can you cast spells as well?
- lt happens.
But nowadays no one believes
in my secrets so l have to be careful.
You shouldn't cross the new faith or
you may end up in hospital says Tubal.
- How did you become a witch?
- l can't say.
- Have you sold your soul?
- Yes, well... perhaps l have...
- Oh, l'm scared again.
- There, there. Go creep into bed...
...and the witch
will come to you with a gift.
Do as l say, little one.
l only want what's good for you.
What are you staring at?
When l walked past the laundry
room l looked into the darkness.
A body hung in a corner
with a rope around it's throat.
l went closer to see who it was.
And l recognised him.
- l'm not scared of you.
- A murderer hung on the hook.
Yes, that's how it is.
You see what you see.
And you know what you know.
But it's not worthwhile
talking about it.
- What a life you lead, Mr Simson.
- Travel, performances, parties.
- A life in luxury.
- You meet beautiful woman, of course.
Women are drawn to magic, you see.
Especially beautiful,
hot-blooded women with instincts.
Sometimes we actually
have to defend ourselves.
At the moment l recall
a Russian princess with...
..with green eyes and a lily-white
breast. Well, let's talk of other things.
You learn to know women. One
glance and everything is revealed.
- That l can sit here with Mr Simson.
- You're pretty.
- Do you think so?
- l know what l'm talking about.
You have a pretty mouth, beautiful
eyes and a really dainty figure.
- Help, mother!
- What are you shouting for?
l don't know, but it felt so strange.
Especially in my belly.
- Perhaps l'm sick.
- lt's the love potion.
Do you think
that could be the cause, Mr Simson?
What are you doing?
Now... let's take a sip each.
And Venus Aphrodite
will come and touch us.
That's the goddess of love, Sara.
Then everything is bliss.
You know what you know
as grandmother usually says.
- l think Mr Simson is misleading me.
- Not at all, my child.
l'm preparing a delectation
for both of us.
- And the Russian princess?
- ls Sara's breast less white?
No, l don't think so.
But her eyes were green.
But... she usually closed her eyes.
You can also do that.
Then let's drink.
- What happens now?
- Now... we just wait.
- Here?
- Well, not here exactly but...
- l know! We'll go to the laundry room.
- Laundry room?
Yes, there are nice, big baskets
full of clean laundry there.
- Well, maybe we should wait here.
- Wait for what?
Mr Vogler might want something.
l thought he...
How pale you are.
Don't you feel well?
l remembered that this potion can
work differently on different people.
One can, for example,
become like an enraged lion.
lt's happened that l've almost
torn my women to shreds.
- How dreadful!
- But l don't want to harm you.
- l won't break.
- Well... it seems different as l said.
One can also feel sick.
l've heard of people who have died.
l think Venus Aphrodite has just
touched me in the right way.
Really... well, maybe so...
But l'm a lot more sensitive.
Don't be so afraid, little Simson.
l won't eat you up.
lmagine that.
He just trotted off with her.
- She's normally hard to entice.
- Drink something. You'll feel better.
- lt's truly warm in here.
- Do you smell how good it is here?
lt's the newly ironed laundry.
And the winter apples over there.
There's a bird's nest in the window.
lt's really warm, anyhow.
- You're shaking.
- Yes, it's so warm.
Take off your coat, then.
Rustan and Antonsson
are still in the kitchen. l can see.
And there's a light on
in Mr Aman and Mr Vogler's room.
- Sara!
- Where are you? l can't see you.
Here, in the laundry basket,
where you said we should be.
Well?
- lt would be simple to seduce you.
- Do you think so?
Certainly. But one gets older and
more considerate, you understand.
- lf l really try, l'll understand.
- You learn not to be indiscriminate.
- Not to pluck every flower you see.
- But you can smell it, anyhow.
l lean over
the delicate chalice and move on.
Why do you talk so much?
- l'm scared of thunderstorms.
- Calm down. You have me.
That feels very, very reassuring.
- What is it?
- The love potion.
- Do you feel it strongly?
- Yes, l'm sweating like a camel!
Lightning again! Hold me tight.
- lt's knotted so tightly.
- Wait, l'll help you.
No, don't look.
Does that button have to be undone
as well? lt's all so terribly difficult.
You don't seem to be so used to it,
little Simson.
l've mostly been abroad, you see.
Quiet. Don't be upset,
little one
Soon you will be able to partake.
Grandmother will give you a gift first,
so that you find comfort.
- ls it an ear?
- lt is an ear.
Whisper all your wishes
into that ear -
- and you will receive what
you ask for. But on one condition.
- What is the condition?
- You must wish for that which lives...
-...is living or will be.
- l don't know what you mean.
No, not now, but it doesn't matter.
There, there... Quiet,
little one, and l will sing for you.
The soldier stood there with his gun
lt was war and the enemy
was due to come
The sun shone and the wind blew
On tired legs the soldier grew
The enemy rode straight out
of the wood
Our man fought them
as best he could
Blades flashed and blood flowed
Many warriors in death bellowed
The soldier carried victory in his sight
lt poured with rain that night
The soldier sat on his own
and wrote
He wrote to his dearest a lengthy note
Love brings peace
Love brings peace solace
Love brings strength
to the most delicate bodice
Love is one
Can never be two
Love is fun
And hard to pursue
- Did you hear, little one?
- l'm almost sleeping.
Yes, yes... Yes, yes...
There'll be a thunderstorm now.
Far, far away.
l'm not scared of thunder.
l call you down, l call you out,
beyond the dead -
- beyond the living,
the living dead...
Beyond the raised hands...
- That Vogler...
- One should flog people like that.
There's something special
with conjurors.
Their faces annoy you.
- Faces?
- That's right.
You get mad when you see
the face of someone like Vogler.
You just want to lash out.
Vogler's face...
lt's a special thing a face like that.
You understand what l mean,
Antonsson?
One should stamp on it...
Faces like that... Vogler's...
...and the old lady's...
and Aman's...
- A ghost!
- Or the devil himself!
- Where's the vodka?
- Where's the vodka?
- The jug is gone!
- On the floor.
- No.
- Where?
The ghost took the vodka!
- What are you up to?
- Preparing for tomorrow morning.
You see what you see and know what
you know. This doesn't smell good.
Blame yourselves.
l hope you were
fed properly in the kitchen.
l'll go to the guest room and unpack.
Perhaps you wonder why
l'm dressed in black, Mr Vogler?
My daughter died last spring.
Mr Vogler. You must forgive those
people. l mean they humiliated you.
They can't understand you, that's
why they hate you. l understand you.
Who are you really?
l recognised you the moment
l saw you. l was shocked.
Forgive me for being so candid,
but l never talk.
l will not cry.
We don't have time for tears now.
l've longed for you. My thoughts have
been with you, l've lived your life.
Even so, l saw you today
for the first time.
Perhaps you are laughing at me
in silence. lt doesn't matter.
My love is strong for both of us.
l understand now why you have
come. Feel how my heart is beating.
You will tell me why my child died.
What God meant.
That is why you have come.
To console my grief...
...and lift the burden of my guilt.
My poor husband doesn't know
anything. How would he understand?
lsn't it terribly warm this evening?
l have experienced such anxiety.
My husband goes to bed
in a few hours. He sleeps very heavily.
l've put a sleeping draught in his
drink. Come to me at 2.00 o'clock.
l'm on the other side of the corridor
opposite the guest room.
Let me kiss your hands. No...
l want to. Just hold still.
You have hurt yourself.
My husband and l have separate
bedrooms since our daughter died.
l didn't die.
But l've already started to come back.
ln actual fact l make
a better ghost than a person.
l have become... convincing.
l never was as an actor.
A shadow...
...of a shadow.
Don't harbour any concern
for my sake, Sire.
l am already in disintegration.
l have prayed for one thing in my life.
Use me. Wield me.
But God never understood
what a strong -
- and devoted slave
l had become.
So l was never utilised.
That's a lie as well.
One goes step by step by step
by step into the darkness.
The actual movement
is the only truth.
When l thought l was dead...
...l was tormented by ghastly dreams.
You're pale around the gills.
Have you seen a ghost?
- Just a little tired.
- l bid you good night.
- My respects to Mrs Egerman.
- You'll find your room?
- l'm often honoured as a guest here.
- Let's have another drink. Sit down!
You simply have to obey when the
Police Commissioner gives orders.
What a singular magnetic wonder.
My great respects
to Dr Vogler's talents.
- l'm his wife.
- Why the masquerade?
- We're wanted and must dress up.
- Why not leave it all?
- Where would l go?
- Let me entrust you with a secret.
l've been struggling with a curious
sympathy for you and your husband.
- lt doesn't sound believable.
- l immediately took a liking to you.
Your faces, your silence,
your natural dignity.
- l wouldn't say it if l weren't tipsy.
- lf you feel that way, leave us alone.
l can't... because you represent
what l despise most of all.
The inexplicable.
Then you can halt your persecution,
Mr Vergerus.
- Our whole enterprise is deception.
- Deception?
Dissimulation, false promises,
double bottoms...
A miserable,
rotten lie through and through.
We're the silliest rabble you can find.
- Your husband feels the same?
- He doesn't speak.
- ls that true?
- Nothing is true.
Your husband has no secret powers?
Maybe not, l wasn't affected.
l only felt a certain cold excitement.
He failed.
- lt's meaningless.
- So, should l feel at ease?
Feel at ease, Mr Vergerus. We can
display our ineptitude over and over.
lt appears that you bemoan the fact.
As if you wished for something else.
But there are no miracles.
lt's always devices and the mouth
that does the work.
The priesthood experiences the same.
God remains silent and people speak.
- Just once.
- So everyone shouts. Just once.
For the non-believers.
But most of all for the believers.
- Just once.
- Just once. lt's true.
You say that you are afraid?
Of me too?
- Mostly of you.
- That's flattering.
One could tolerate
your manner and wits.
- What frightens you, then?
- Your smile, your benevolence.
You're the only sensible person
in the company.
Why continue on a road that leads
to disgrace and imprisonment?
- lt hasn't always been like this?
- No...
Perhaps you once believed... in the
meaning or usefulness of it all?
- That was long ago.
- Why not stop in time, Mrs Vogler?
lt's meaningless.
- You mean your husband?
- l mean it's meaningless.
There are no roads back...
or to the side.
- Not for us.
- l have a suggestion despite that.
When you've grown weary of your
magnets you can look me up.
l promise to help you.
ln one way or another.
And my husband...?
l'm very grateful.
l will leave at once.
One last question.
Can we expect further unmaskings?
Or has Dr Vogler's Magical Theatre
exhausted it's resources?
You do me an honour, Doctor.
- Your wife is faithful into madness.
- Go now, for God's sake.
Do you think your husband wants to
murder me? Do you want to kill me?
You hate me, l like you.
lt's really stimulating.
- Please be so good as to leave.
- l will leave. Good night, Madame.
Good night, Mr Doctor!
Remember the summer in Lyon when
we earned well and bought a house -
- and thought we'd stop travelling?
Then we sold the property
and bought the carriage and horses.
You started acting dumb as well.
Remember the Grand Duke at Koten
who was so taken by me -
- that he promised to recommend
us to His Majesty in Sweden?
You thought l betrayed you
and you gave the Duke a thrashing.
Then we sat in prison for two months
before the Duke forgave us.
He was very noble. Still promised to
recommend us to the Swedish court.
Do you think he's done it?
- l don't think so either.
- l hate them.
l hate their faces, their bodies,
their movements, their voices.
l'm scared, as well.
Then l'm powerless.
- And if l leave you?
- Go on, if you want to!
lt doesn't make any difference.
Albert... Emanuel...
Vogler...
You came after all.
What are you going to do?
l have no guilt.
He was the one who seduced me.
You are thinking of hitting me?
No, you don't dare to hit me.
Because you are a coward.
- lt's bleeding.
- Forgive me. Sorry.
No... Don't go.
We thank you for your approval
and hope our tricks truly please you.
We'll now show you something more
amazing. A number that's won acclaim.
Where Mr Vogler and his assistant's
rare powers lend more proof -
- to the inscrutable bedevilment
of world order.
Would one
of the ladies present step forward?
A woman with a clean heart
and beautiful thoughts.
Mrs Police Commissioner?
This is the absolute...
...unprecedented moment of truth.
Through the power of magnets,
Mrs Starbeck will be freed of all wiles.
Every word she utters
will be of the purest truth.
Mrs Starbeck,
how much pin money do you receive?
- l protest against this trick!
- One moment, Commissioner.
- lt's in the name of science.
- What year did you marry?
l'm not married.
lt's awful, l'm far too young!
- Aren't you married?
- Mr Starbeck is a carrot.
- Cease this humiliating act!
- On Saturdays he goes to a brothel.
He eats like a pig
and farts at the table.
- Stop her, stop her...!
- Mr Starbeck has a wig, he smells.
Can't you at least
think of our poor children?
l've wondered how many
are Starbeck's.
Although a few of them are stupid
and ugly. Mr Starbeck is a pig!
l have to go home at once, l have
a roast in the oven. You stay, dear.
You could use
a little entertainment.
l haven't said anything silly, have l?
These magicians are remarkable.
Goodbye, you'll be home for dinner?
No, my friend, l'm not revengeful.
You must never think that.
l'll see myself out.
Our last number
is ''The lnvisible Chain''.
Would one of the gentlemen
be of service? The stronger the better.
Antonsson...
- l don't want to, Consul.
- lt's an order!
Bravo, my good man, bravo.
Nothing dangerous -
- nothing that will hurt you.
Just breathe easily.
Antonsson is a hefty man,
but his physical powers are nothing -
- in comparison
with Mr Vogler's spiritual strength.
Assistant, tie up that man
with the invisible chains.
Your hands are linked together.
But your feet are also bound.
And the chain is fixed to the wall.
After him!
There's no doubt
that the man is dead.
My report will point out Antonsson's
culpability as negligible.
No penalty can be calculated as
no relative demands an investigation.
Should it be otherwise
it will be reviewed in full -
- and special arrangements will be
made to examine claims on Mr Vogler.
Claims that will probably amount
to considerable sums.
Does anyone have any objections?
l would point out that if no person
finds cause to challenge -
- the above writ
the case will be dismissed.
- What does it mean, if one dares ask?
- lt means...
...that you can go to hell
if it pleases you, Mr Tubal.
Thanks for the advice, Commissioner.
What will happen to Vogler?
ln accordance with the statute
on autopsies in official institutions -
- the said Emanuel Vogler
will be duly examined -
- obedient to a decision by Medical
Councillor Vergerus and myself.
The autopsy will be performed
at once at the city's expense...
-...and in the name of science.
- We're very grateful.
l thought you would be.
lt's time to carry Mr Vogler up to the
attic where the autopsy will occur.
For scientific reasons the councillor
wishes to begin as quickly as possible.
- As in executions?
- Maybe so.
You can take him in that black box
you're sitting on, Mr Tubal.
lf Mrs Vogler experiences difficulty
l can recommend -
- an excellent house
where l have some influence.
- l'm grateful for your concern.
-My wife had quite droll fancies.
Don't you think so?
So we carried the coffin
up to the attic.
And the Medical Councillor
came with the Commissioner -
- and lifted Vogler's body onto a
big table and started undressing him.
- What are they actually doing?
- Cutting up the body and entrails.
Cutting off the head and looking at the
brain. The blood just flows and flows.
lmagine if he wakes
and gets up under the knife -
- and descends from the table
and comes down the stairs...
lmagine he comes in and
looks at us with bloody eye holes...
- There, at the door!
- Don't say that!
Don't be scared, Sanna.
l will protect you.
The best we can do is sing
a song about trust in the Lord.
You are so right, Sofia.
What shall we sing?
- Do you regret it?
- l haven't promised you anything.
- Yesterday you were hot to trot.
- Quiet, don't embarrass me.
Yesterday was yesterday.
And today is Sunday.
''...and after the autopsy have not
found any physiological peculiarities'' -
- ''or abnormalities and must class
the phenomenon that appeared'' -
- ''in connection with said Vogler as
temporary and therefore meaningless.''
''At any rate of such little importance
it hardly merits further attention.''
That was all?
l thank you for your help.
l'll send a copy of the protocol
as soon as l've written it out.
Are you coming?
l'd like your signature on my report.
l'll come by tomorrow morning.
Good day.
Well?
What will happen to grandmother?
Little fat pigs shouldn't grunt too
loudly. They could become bacon.
l don't bear grudges, but l have a
good memory, especially for faces.
That was the first time the fly farted
without losing it's behind -
- as my mother used to say.
Watch out. There are asylums
and institutions for you and your ilk.
- Do you understand what l mean?
- Oh, yes...
My regards to your wife, by the way.
Would you do me a favour?
Could you please stop the clock.
- Do you hear how quiet it is?
- Yes...
lt's very quiet.
- Why did you let it happen?
- Me?
- You wanted revenge.
- l don't know what you're talking of.
Vergerus surprised me,
l said neither yes nor no.
- You wanted revenge.
- An odd revenge in that case.
Yes... it's very odd.
Take revenge...
l can't bear it anymore.
Manda? Manda...
Do not turn around.
Go out and lock the attic door.
Don't ask. Do as l say.
lt's very warm here, under the roof.
A temporary indisposition.
Some kind of tool...
Either this is a dream,
or l'm losing my senses.
As it's inconceivable l've lost my
reason, l'll attend my awakening.
Actually, it is interesting...
Let him be!
You brought about a fear of death.
Nothing more.
- Nothing else.
- Let him be, l said.
Could l have some money?
We have nothing, we're cleaned out.
You could at least give us some coins
for our entertainment.
You're staring at me as if for the first
time. Even though we were soulmates.
l've never seen you before.
l don't know you.
l was disguised.
Does that make a difference?
Ask your husband,
we don't need a big sum.
Don't touch me!
Medical Councillor!
Would you help me? Talk to the
Commissioner so we can leave.
- l promise we won't come back.
- And who did l examine?
A poor actor who's greatest wish was
to be cut up and scraped clean.
You lent him your face, changed
places. You were never dead.
- Yes, a cheap trick.
- Are you Vogler?
- l think so.
- Not an actor, third or fourth person?
Taunt me by all means,
but help me.
- You said you felt sympathy...
- l preferred his face to yours.
Disguise yourself again
so l recognise you -
- then perhaps
we can discuss your situation.
You are ungrateful, Sire!
Haven't l exerted myself above my
talents to give you an experience?
lt was an awful performance,
but of course you should be paid.
Regard that figure carefully.
Then tell me if l have won our wager.
That's right. l have lost.
Simson, go and hitch the horses,
we're leaving.
- Would you help us pack, Mr Tubal?
- l'm staying here.
My path is another. One should
live piously, as Sofia says.
Higher aims, you understand.
Greater meaning and less apparatus.
No... l'm not coming with you.
You're looking at my pouches, aren't
you? And perhaps you're wondering?
Go ahead and look.
This is 6,000 riksdaler -
- that grandmother has collected
through the years and tucked away.
Grandmother's medicine...
People will pay anything for love.
You didn't know that, hmm?
Goodbye, Albert. l'm off. l've always
said you're stubborn and careless.
One should know one's limitations.
So... help me down.
- There they go. l won't miss them.
- Neither will l.
No, neither will l.
- Come on, Tubal.
- What? Again, Sofia? But...
Yes, l'm coming, Sofia. l'm coming...
Please could l come? l don't know
what's happened, l must be crazy.
lt must be that love potion. Because
l can't think the way l've decided to.
- Go and fetch your things. Hurry!
- Thank you, thanks so much!
- Simson, l'm coming with you!
- l'll help you!
Why aren't they coming?
We have to set off.
lf we can just get out of town.
lt's too late. Too late...
You were very lucky, Tubal.
- Who are you, Sire?
- The Magnetiser Emanuel Vogler...
...we thought we examined a few
hours ago. Mr Vogler deceived us.
Probably, l say probably, Mr Vogler is
standing there, wrapped in a blanket.
My congratulations...
By Royal appointment l have
pleasure in conveying the following:
His Majesty the King
has let it be known -
- that he wishes to witness one
of Vogler's magnetic amusements.
l am hereby ordered to conduct the
said Vogler to the Royal Castle -
- so that arrangements can be made
for the evening's entertainment.
Given at Stockholm Castle, 1 4 July
anno 1846. Marshal of the Court.
l won't mention a word
of what has transpired.
For your own sake.
lt is high time. Hurry, Dr Vogler.
Gather my apparatus
and send them to the castle.
But be careful,
they are precious objects.
- Oh, darling Simson!
- Not now, damnit. Tonight!
