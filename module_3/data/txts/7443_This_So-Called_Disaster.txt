OK. I THINK I ASKED YOU
ABOUT THE CHALLENGES INVOLVED
IN BOTH WRITING
AND DIRECTING,
BUT I'M NOT SURE
YOU ANSWERED.
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A HELPFUL THING--
THE CHALLENGES.
THE CHALLENGES. WELL, Y-Y-YOU KNOW,
OK, I-IT'S ALL A CHALLENGE,
BUT IT...
OH, BOY.
WE GOT SOME GUY, UH,
WHO'S NOT AROUND HIM
WHO BURNS THE DEAD BODY.
ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT WOODY?
(Sean)
ARE WE ALMOST ON? WHAT DID HE SAY?
YEAH, HE JUST CALLED PLACES.
<i>PLEASE STAND BY.</i>
<i>WE'RE ABOUT TO BEGIN.</i>
I HAVEN'T BEEN
USING THESE QUARTERS.
I'LL TAKE THEM AND SEE
IF THEY COME IN HANDY, THOUGH.
IT'S THE DAY
BEFORE GUY FAWKES DAY,
AND THIS IS SAM SHEPARD.
YEAH,
AND GUY FAWKES WAS... YEAH.
SEAN. MR. PENN.
(Nick)
YEAH, LOOK. LET'S, UH, LET'S RELAX.
OK?
I AM RELAXED.
LOOK, LET'S JUST
RELAX HERE.
HOW ABOUT
WE JUST RELAX?
I AM RELAXED,
PAL.
THERE'S NO NEED
TO GET--GET UPSET OVER NOTHING.
THINGS ARE HARD ENOUGH.
YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.
HOW ABOUT WE, UH,
HAVE A-- HAVE A DRINK?
HE DOESN'T DRINK,
REMEMBER?
HE PRETENDS.
HE'S THE PRETENDER.
(Nick)
BACK OFF, RAY!
WHAT KIND OF A BUG
YOU GOT UP YOUR ASS ANYWAY?
THE MAN COMES OVER HERE
WITH SOUP!
COMES OVER HERE AS FRIENDLY AND
NEIGHBORLY AS HE POSSIBLY CAN BE
AND YOU JUMP ALL OVER HIM
LIKE A COLD SWEAT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
TELL HIM TO STOP
STARING AT ME.
YOU'VE TERRIFIED HIM,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
LOOK, I APOLOGIZE
FOR MY BROTHER'S BEHAVIOR.
(Sean)
DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR ME.
DON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR MY BEHAVIOR.
AND TELL HIM
TO STOP STARING AT ME!
DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO HIM.
(Sam) NOW ONE THING HAS
TO FIRE ANOTHER THING.
IT WORKS LIKE--
ON COMBUSTIBILITY.
LIKE, IF ONE THING
DOESN'T FIRE THE NEXT THING--
(Sean)
I THINK-- I--I THINK IT CAN'T FOLLOW
A--A KIND OF... THERE'S LIKE A
COMIC TIMING THING GOIN' ON HERE.
RIGHT.
...THAT TO ME KILLS
BEING ABLE TO RESPOND...
- MMM-HMM.
- ...YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
FOR THIS KIND OF MOMENT.
IF IT'S ONE OF THESE,
YOU KNOW, SORRY KIND OF THINGS,
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
THEN--THEN I--I KIND OF GO...
MMM-HMM, MMM-HMM.
...UH, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE IT'S
GOTTA BE-- BE REALLY REAL THERE...
MMM-HMM.
...VERSUS, YOU KNOW, MAKING IT
A TAKE OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.
(Sam)
YEAH, I MEAN, SEE, THE--THE, UH...
(Nick) YOU KNOW WHAT,
DON'T POKE HIM IN THE CHEST.
LAST ONE IN THE HEART--
IN THE HEART, RIGHT THERE!
OH, I'M SORRY.
(Sam)
YEAH. IN THE SCRIPT-- IN THE SCRIPT,
YOU'RE POKING YOUR OWN CHEST.
YOU POKE YOUR OWN CHEST.
YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE ME,
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE
IN MY OWN CHEST, RIGHT HERE!
OH, I'M SORRY.
SIR.
- OH, I'M SORRY, SIR.
- (Sam) SEE HOW THAT WORKS?
YES, OK. SORRY.
(Sam)
LET'S TAKE IT BACK TO...
OK.
OH, I'M SORRY, MR. RAY.
IF YOU SAW HER,
YOU WOULD KNOW.
SHE WOULD BURN A HOLE RIGHT
THROUGH YOUR HEART, RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT THROUGH THE CENTER
OF YOUR SOUL.
RIGHT HERE!
RIGHT HERE!
OH, SORRY, SIR.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT THAT "SIR" SHIT?
WHAT DID I FUCKING TELL YOU?
(Nick)
RAY.
WELL, I WARNED HIM.
I DON'T LIKE THE IMPLICATIONS!
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
YOU DON'T GO AROUND
CALLING ANYBODY "SIR".
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU SAY
TO SOMEBODY YOU RESPECT.
HE DOESN'T KNOW ME
FROM ADAM.
HOW DOES HE KNOW I'M SOMEBODY
HE SHOULD RESPECT?
(Nick)
WELL, HE KNOWS NOW, DOESN'T HE?
NOW HE'LL THINK TWICE
BEFORE HE GOES AROUND
CALLING STRANGERS "SIR".
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,
CALLING ME "SIR"?
<i>(Sam)</i> <i>YOU HAVE AN IMAGINATION</i>
<i>ABOUT WHERE YOU MIGHT THINK</i>
<i>THE ACTOR IS GOING</i>
<i>TO TAKE THE MATERIAL,</i>
<i>BUT IT'S NEVER THE SAME</i>
<i>AS THE ACTUAL EVENT.</i>
<i>IT CAN NEVER BE THE SAME,</i>
<i>AND THAT'S SURPRISING, ALWAYS.</i>
<i>IN THIS CASE,</i> <i>IT'S BEEN SURPRISING</i>
<i>IN A REALLY GOOD WAY.</i>
<i>I DIDN'T THINK WE'D ARRIVE</i>
<i>AT A LOT OF THE THINGS</i>
<i>WE'VE ALREADY ARRIVED AT</i>
<i>SO EARLY.</i>
<i>WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY</i>
<i>TO GO.</i>
UM, I'M SHEILA TOUSEY.
IT'S, UH, NOVEMBER 4TH.
BREEDERS' CUP.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S BREEDERS'
CUP DAY. -BREEDERS' CUP DAY.
I'M JAMES GAMMON.
THERE'S A VEIN OF THE SAMENESS
THROUGH A LOT OF IT,
UH, THE FATHER CHARACTERS
IN SAM'S PLAY.
<i>THE CONNECTION,</i>
<i>NOW THAT I'M LOOKING BACK</i> <i>ON IT,</i>
<i>THE PERCEPTION OF WHO AM I?</i>
<i>JUST WHO AM I?</i>
<i>(James)</i>
<i>IT SEEMS LIKE</i> <i>KIND OF AN INNOCENT</i>
<i>AND RIDICULOUS QUESTION</i>
<i>OF SORTS,</i>
<i>BUT THEN WHEN YOU</i>
<i>REALLY THINK ABOUT IT,</i> <i>IT ISN'T.</i>
<i>WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?</i>
<i>WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU</i>
<i>SUPPOSED TO BE?</i>
<i>ARE YOU AN ECHO?</i>
<i>ARE YOU A SHADOW?</i>
<i>OR WHO IS IT THAT</i>
<i>YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE?</i>
JOHNNY DARK.
OH, SCARLET DARK.
<i>(Johnny)</i> <i>THE PLAYS ARE OBVIOUSLY</i>
<i>ABOUT SAM AND HIS FATHER</i>
AND THE STAGE IS FILLED
WITH A LOT OF MEN.
AND USUALLY THERE ARE
THESE 2 BROTHERS GOING ON,
WHICH I ALWAYS TOOK TO BE
ASPECTS OF HIMSELF.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST THE 2 SIDES
OF HIM TALKING TO EACH OTHER,
STRUGGLING AGAINST EACH OTHER
AND LOVING EACH OTHER.
WITH THE OLD MAN
ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND.
IT'S WEIGHED AGAINST THE FACT THAT
IN REAL LIFE HE GREW UP IN A FAMILY
WITH 2 SISTERS.
<i>HAD A STRONG RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>WITH HIS MOTHER.</i>
<i>A-AND THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO,</i>
<i>THAT'S NOT...</i>
<i>"THAT'S FINE,</i>
<i>THAT'S WONDERFUL.</i>
<i>BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT...</i>
<i>FOR ME, THAT'S NOT WHAT</i>
<i>IT WAS ABOUT," HE WOULD SAY.</i>
<i>IT'S LIKE ME AND MY DAD,</i>
<i>AND HIS INCREDIBLE VIOLENCE,</i>
<i>AND MY RESPECT FOR HIM</i>
<i>AND MY FEAR OF HIM, YOU KNOW.</i>
YEAH, I WAS HOPING
THAT THIS WOULD PROBABLY--
THAT THIS COULD BE
THE FINAL PLAY ABOUT THAT.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO RETURN TO IT ANYMORE.
AND IT TOOK ME...
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS
IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO GET IT DONE...
I MEAN, MY DAD DIED IN '84
AND IT TOOK ME, LIKE, 5 YEARS
TO EVEN BEGIN TO START TO
STRUCTURE THAT, YOU KNOW.
AND--AND THEN I QUIT ON IT.
SO I HAD ACTUALLY QUIT
ON THIS PLAY, YOU KNOW.
UNTIL JOE
AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE PICKED IT UP
AND TOLD ME
TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN.
AND IT TOOK ME, LIKE,
10 YEARS TO FINISH IT.
I DON'T NEED A RECON--
I DON'T NEED A RECONCILIATION.
I DON'T NEED ONE
WITH YOU EITHER.
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD, RAY.
'CAUSE GUESS WHAT?
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.
PERFECT. THAT'S-- THAT'S RIGHT
WHERE YOU WANT TO BE, NICK.
HE'S GONE NOW.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT
WHERE YOU WANT TO BE.
THESE 2 PARALLEL LINES HERE,
THESE 2 PARALLEL LINES,
THE--THE MORE PARALLEL
THEY ARE,
THE STRONGER IT IS. OK?
IF YOU START TO WANDER IN,
IF YOU START TO WANDER OUT.
IF EITHER ONE OF YOU...
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?
IT'S SLOPPY, IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY DEFINITION.
BUT IF YOU KEEP ON THESE PARALLEL
LINES, IT'S VERY POWERFUL, OK?
(Sam)
AND THEN, WHEN IT TURNS INTO...
LET'S SEE--
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
THEN--THEN WHOA,
YOU KNOW.
EVERYBODY JUST TAKE THAT BEAT,
AND THEN ESTEBAN, YOU KNOW.
SO THERE'S JUST
THAT BEAT THERE. UM...
I DON'T REALLY EXPECT
TO FIND NOBODY?
NO, NO!
'CAUSE YOU GOT TO ASSUME
THE FATHER BEAT THE MOTHER
AND ASSUME HE WAS TOUGH
ON THE KIDS.
THERE'S, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME
WHIPPIN'S THERE THAT TOOK PLACE.
(Sam)
YEAH.
AND, UH, AND THE LAST THING
IN THE WORLD YOU'D WANT TO BE
IS THAT WAY.
YEAH.
BUT YOU ARE.
IT'S A FACT. AND, RAY--
KING-- THAT KING LEAR THING.
LET IT NOT BE MADNESS.
YES, YES, YES.
LET IT NOT BE MADNESS.
IT IS, THOUGH.
THERE'S NO WAY
TO GET AROUND IT.
YEAH, THE MORE-- THE MORE I CAN
KEEP IN CONTACT WITH THAT,
THE MORE I CAN--
I CAN DRIVE.
BUT THAT'S A GREAT THING
TO PLAY, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THAT'S--
ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT...
YEAH.
...THE THING OF--OF--
OF BEING COMPLETELY SPLIT.
(Nick) THERE'S A CERTAIN
KIND OF CRUELTY TO YOU,
ISN'T THERE?
I NEVER REALIZED THAT BEFORE.
(Sean) I GET MEAN AS A SNAKE
IF I DON'T SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.
YOU HAD NO CALL
TO BE DOING THAT TO HIM.
OH, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?
YOU KNOW,
YOU COME WALKING IN--
WALTZING IN HERE,
WITH NO IDEA.
NO CONCEPT THAT THERE MIGHT BE
REPERCUSSIONS, CONSEQUENCES!
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES!
HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR LITTLE MIND, EARL?
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED? SITTIN'
OUT HERE... TELL ME THESE LINES.
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND, EARL?
IS THAT
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?
SITTING HERE ALL ALONE
WITH DEAD DADDY FOR DAYS ON END.
(Sean) YEAH. HAVE YOU
LOST YOUR MIND, EARL?
IS THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
SITTING OUT HERE, ALL ALONE
WITH DEAD DADDY,
FOR DAYS ON END?
SOMETHIN' IS GOIN' ON HERE.
SOMETHING I AM
NOT BEING LET IN ON.
OK.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
WHAT TIME IS IT ANYWAY?
OH! AH!
MY DAD CAME OUT OF
A--A MIDWESTERN FARM BACKGROUND.
HIS DAD WAS A WHEAT FARMER.
<i>THE FARM WAS IN McHENRY.</i>
<i>I THINK DURING THE DEPRESSION,</i>
<i>HE WAS BASICALLY</i>
<i>SORT OF SUPPORTING THE FAMILY,</i>
LIKE DOIN' ODD JOBS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,
'CAUSE, UH, HIS DAD STARTED SELLING
HERSHEY BARS DOOR-TO-DOOR.
YOU KNOW, FROM WHEAT FARMING
TO HERSHEY BAR SALESMAN.
AND, UH, MY DAD WORKED
FOR THE PAPER FOR A WHILE,
<i>FOR THE</i>
<i>CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE.</i>
<i>THEN HE LEFT THERE</i>
<i>AND WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE,</i>
<i>MARRIED MY MOM, AND THEY
BOTH WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER
<i>FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.</i>
<i>THIS IS HIM IN--</i>
<i>STATIONED IN ITALY.</i>
<i>EACH BOMB</i>
<i>REPRESENTS A MISSION.</i>
(Woody)
DID YOU CALL A CAB, MR. MOSS?
I HAD A BOTTLE HERE.
YOU DIDN'T WALK OFF
WITH MY BOTTLE, DID YOU?
NO, SIR, I JUST GOT HERE.
SOMEBODY'S GOT
MY DAMN BOTTLE!
HEY, WHAT, DID--DID YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE, MR. MOSS?
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU
WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO.
YOU'RE HERE TO TAKE ME?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHERE DO I WANT TO GO?
CASH! MONEY!
MEAN, GREEN! HOW ABOUT THAT!
LOOK AT THAT!
WHERE'D A DESPERATE MAN
COME UP WITH SO MUCH CASH?
SURPRISED YOU, HUH?
GIVE YOU A START.
NO, SIR.
HERE. THAT'S BLOOD MONEY
RIGHT THERE, MR. TAXI.
WORLD WAR ll
BLOOD MONEY!
GUESS HOW MANY
DEAD JAPS THAT COST?
TAKE A GUESS.
I, UH...
THAT'S BEYOND
YOUR IMAGINATION, BUB.
BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION.
<i>(Sam)</i>
<i>MY DAD SPOKE FLUENT SPANISH.</i>
HE WAS GOIN' TO NIGHT SCHOOL
AFTER HE CAME OUT OF THE WAR,
TRYING TO, UH, FINISH HIS MASTER'S
DEGREE AND STUFF LIKE THAT
<i>AND FINALLY GOT HIS</i>
<i>TEACHING CERTIFICATE</i>
<i>AND WENT ON TO START</i>
<i>TEACHIN' SPANISH.</i>
<i>AND BECAME</i>
<i>A FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR.</i>
WENT DOWN TO SOUTH AMERICA
AND STUDIED DOWN THERE AND STUFF,
BUT ALL ALONG THE WAY,
SORT OF SLOWLY,
SECRETLY, DRINKING,
AND STARTING TO
NOT SHOW UP AT WORK,
UH, CRASHING CARS.
DOIN' ALL OF THE SORT OF
TYPICAL THINGS.
AND LOST HIS JOB, ETC.
THEN EVERYTHING STARTED
TO DE-DEGENERATE FROM THAT POINT.
I GUESS I WAS ABOUT 12 OR 13
WHEN IT ALL BEGAN TO FALL APART.
RIGHT AROUND THEN.
AND HE HAD BOUGHT
A LITTLE, UM, AVOCADO RANCH FARM
OUT EAST OF L.A.,
OUT NEAR THE DESERT,
BUT COULDN'T
HOLD THINGS TOGETHER
AND THEN IT KIND OF
DISSIPATED FROM THERE.
HE WENT OUT TO TEXAS
FOR A WHILE,
<i>IN AND OUT OF JAIL</i>
<i>AND THEN WENT TO NEW MEXICO</i>
<i>AND WOUND UP IN NEW MEXICO.</i>
I WENT DOWN THERE
AND HUNG OUT WITH HIM
A LITTLE BIT.
<i>AND WHEN HE WAS SOBER,</i>
UH, IT WAS-- IT WAS OK.
BUT WHEN HE WAS DRINKING,
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, YOU KNOW.
HI, SEAN.
HOW ARE YOU?
(Nick) YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO KIND OF KEEP A...
I'VE GOT A LITTLE CLIPPER.
DID YOU COME IN
BY BOAT?
NO. NO, I STAYED
IN--IN THE CITY.
MMM-HMM.
(Sam) ALL RIGHT,
I'VE GOT A FEW CUTS IN HERE
I WANT TO MAKE,
AND SOME ADJUSTMENTS.
AND THEN I THOUGHT WE'D JUST
READ THROUGH THIS 3rd ACT.
GREAT.
(Sam)
"HE WAS KICKIN' HER, EARL.
"HE WAS KICKIN' HER
JUST LIKE THIS:
"LIKE A DOG.
"EVERY TIME HE KICKED HER,
"HIS RAGE GREW A LITTLE BIT
AND HIS FACE CHANGED,
"HIS EYES BULGED OUT
AND THE BLOOD RUSHED INTO HIS NECK
AND HER BLOOD WAS FLYING
ALL OVER THE KITCHEN".
THIS STUFF HERE, "LIKE A DOG,
LIKE SOME KIND OF A
BITCH CURRY..." LA-DI-DA...
THE--THE--THE SIMILE STUFF
BOTHERED ME SOMEWHAT.
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A LITTLE LITERARY.
LIKE SOMETHING
HE COULDN'T STAND TO SEE LIVING,
SOMETHING THAT'D BE PUT
TO DEATH
BECAUSE IT WOULD REMIND HIM
TOO MUCH OF HIS OWN SHAME,
HIS OWN FAILURE.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING.
NOW, I'M THINKING
WHAT WE CAN DO IS, GO:
"HE WAS KICKIN' HER
JUST LIKE THIS.
AND EVERY TIME HE KICKED HER,
HIS RAGE GREW A LITTLE BIT".
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S FINE.
- DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU?
- ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
WE BETTER DO THAT.
AND GET RID OF THIS, UH,
JOSEPH CONRAD SHIT.
(Sam) THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY POWERFUL GOIN' ON THERE.
I THINK WE'RE--WE'RE REALLY
ONTO SOMETHIN',
ESPECIALLY WITH
SHEILA PULLING YOU GUYS.
(Nick)
YEAH.
BUT WHAT WE
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF
IS THAT IT DOESN'T TURN
INTO A SCREAMING MATCH.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
AND--AND WE LOSE
THE--THE SENSE
OF WHAT'S REALLY,
UH, TAKING PLACE, YOU KNOW.
<i>(James)</i>
<i>SAM HAS COMBINED HIS LIFE</i>
<i>AND A PIECE THAT HE WAS
WORKING ON CONCERNING HIS FATHER.
<i>ALSO, HE WAS SPURRED ON</i>
<i>BY A SHORT STORY</i>
<i>BY FRANK O'CONNOR.</i>
<i>THE COMBINATION</i>
<i>OF THOSE 2 ELEMENTS</i>
<i>SEEMED TO BRING FORTH</i>
<i>THE PIECE.</i>
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M THE VICTIM.
YOU'RE THE VICTIM?
WHAT STINKS?
YOU GOT ANY WOMEN, TAXI?
I GOT A DOOZY.
KNOW WHAT SHE DID TO ME?
YOU WANNA KNOW? GUESS!
I BET YOU'LL NEVER GUESS!
MR. MOSS, I--I--
SHE PRONOUNCED ME DEAD!
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID!
DEAD?
DEAD! THAT'S IT!
WE WERE INCARCERATED
TOGETHER
AND SHE MADE
THAT PRONOUNCEMENT.
SHE JUST BELTED IT OUT TO THE
GENERAL JAIL COMMUNITY AT LARGE.
<i>"SENOR</i> MOSS IS DEAD".
NOW IT'S ALL OVER TOWN.
ALL OVER THIS TERRITORY,
EVERYBODY THINKS I AM DEAD!
THEY MUST KNOW
SHE WAS LYIN' BY--
ON THE CONTRARY,
NOBODY THINKS
SHE WAS LYING.
NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY SOUL!
WELL, DON'T THEY SEE YOU WALKIN'
AROUND AND TALKIN' AND EVERYTHING?
WALKING AND TALKING?
WH-WH-WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?
THERE'S A WHOLE SHITLOAD
OF WALKERS AND TALKERS.
YOU THINK THEY'RE ALL
IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING, HUH?
<i>TOBY TRIMS
THE CHRISTMAS TREE.
I GOT IT
IN THE 7TH GRADE.
AND I GOT
A LOT OF LAUGHS,
UH, SMALL TOWN
IN THE MIDWEST, 2,500 PEOPLE,
AND I GOT
A LOT OF LAUGHS.
I, UH, IT WAS WONDERFUL.
I PLAYED TOBY, OF COURSE.
AND I... BUT AFTERWARDS,
AFTER THE SHOW WAS OVER,
I FOUND OUT
WHY I GOT THE LAUGHS.
IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD-- I HAD
TUCKED MY SHIRT INTO MY UNDERWEAR
INSTEAD OF MY PANTS
AND MY UNDERWEAR WAS SHOWING,
AND THAT WAS VERY
FUNNY IN THOSE DAYS.
IT TAKES COURAGE.
I GAVE HIM COURAGE,
THE DROWNED MAN.
HE COMES UP FOR AIR,
HE GASPS.
NOW HE BEGINS
TO GO BACK HOME.
NOW HE BEGINS
TO RETURN.
AS YOU WILL SEE.
NOW YOU WILL SEE.
HE REMEMBERS NOW.
(James)
I REMEMBER THE DAY I DIED.
AND I RAN OUT INTO THE YARD.
AND I REMEMBERED.
I REMEMBERED THIS DEATH
CUT OFF EVERYTHING.
BIRDS, FAR AWAY.
BIRDS.
TREES.
SKY.
REMOVED.
EVERYTHING OUT
BEYOND REACH.
AND I RAN.
I RAN TO THE CAR
AND THEN I DROVE.
NOW I'D LIKE TO READ IT
THROUGH JUST SITTING HERE.
I REMEMBER--
WHAT?
YOUR VOICE, YOUR EYES,
UM, THAT SMELL.
THE SMELL?
WHAT SMELL?
THAT, UH, THAT...
BOOZE?
NO.
WHAT THEN?
SOME--SOME SCENT.
A SCENT?
YOU MEAN LIKE A DOG
OR SOMETHING?
NO.
YOU MEAN LIKE A DOG,
DON'T YOU?
LIKE A MAD DOG.
NO, B.O.
FOR CRIPE'S SAKE.
(Sam) YEAH, BUT, JIM, I THINK
THE SENSE THROUGH THAT WHOLE THING
IS--IS--IS ACTUAL--
ACTUAL DOUBT.
YOU KNOW, IN OTHER WORDS,
I DON'T THINK IT'S SO MUCH THE SENSE
THAT, UM, YOU BELIEVE EARL
ALREADY KNOWS THE ANSWERS.
THE--THE--THE DOUBT IS HERE,
YOU KNOW.
THERE'S, LIKE, FRAGILITY
THAT I'M LOOKING FOR--
(James)
LIKE AM I ALIVE OR NOT?
THAT--THAT TURNS OVER
INTO THE MAD DOG AT THE END OF IT.
(James)
RIGHT.
YOU KNOW?
AND IT'S STILL
THE BASIC QUESTION
THAT HENRY HAS, YOU KNOW,
WHETHER HE'S DEAD OR NOT.
IT'S AN AMAZING DILEMMA
WHEN ONE BEGINS
TO DISCOVER THAT
Y-YOU ARE LIVING YOUR LIFE
AS A SOMNAMBULIST.
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'RE--
YOU'RE LIVING YOU LIFE IN A TRANCE.
IN--IN--IN A--
IN A DREAM,
TO BE CORNY ABOUT IT.
WHEN THAT OCCURS,
THERE-THERE'S A KIND
OF AMAZING THING THAT TAKES PLACE.
ONE IS DESPAIR
AND THE OTHER IS
A SUDDEN AWAKENING, YOU KNOW.
<i>THERE'S ANOTHER--ANOTHER</i>
<i>WAY OF SEEING.</i>
<i>AND THE CHARACTER,</i>
<i>HENRY MOSS, OF COURSE,</i> <i>REALIZES</i>
<i>THAT HE IS IN FACT DEAD</i>
<i>ALTHOUGH HE'S WALKING AROUND.</i>
<i>BUT THERE'S NOTHING</i>
<i>HE CAN DO ABOUT IT.</i>
<i>THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE.</i>
<i>HE'S A WALKING DEAD MAN.</i>
<i>AND THAT'S THE TRAGEDY.</i>
(Sheila)
THE HOSPITAL?
YOU'RE WAY
BEYOND THE HOSPITAL.
<i>(Sam)</i> <i>IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO EXPECT</i>
<i>THAT CHARACTER TO TURN AROUND</i>
<i>AND REALIZE THAT HE HAS AN
ALTERNATIVE, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T.
NICK NOLTE.
IT'S FEBRUARY 19TH.
I WAS IN CALIFORNIA
IN THE EARLY '60s. I WAS, LIKE, 21
AND I--I HAD A KIND OF,
I SUPPOSE WHAT WE CALL IN LIFE
THOSE MOMENTS
OF DISINTEGRATION, YOU KNOW,
WHERE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING
KIND OF FALLS ALL APART
AND OUR IDENTITIES KIND OF...
SO MY FOLKS WERE LIVING
IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA,
AND I WENT HOME
TO LIVE WITH THEM.
AND I KIND OF LOCKED MYSELF
IN A ROOM.
AND I STARTED READING.
AND, UM, ONE OF THE BOOKS
I READ AS I WAS,
I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN
OR JUST PERSONALITY
DISINTEGRATION OR WHATEVER.
BUT ONE OF THE BOOKS I READ,
IN FACT, 3 OF THEM,
WERE STANISLAVSKI.
<i>AN ACTOR PREPARES; BUILDING A
CHARACTER; CREATING A CHARACTER.
THE WAY YOU'RE REFINING IT
IS THE WAY-- THE WAY IT SHOULD BE,
JUST INCH BY INCH. BY INCH.
<i>(Nick)</i>
<i>AND--AND READING THOSE BOOKS,</i>
<i>EVEN THOUGH I HADN'T ACTED</i>
<i>OR ANYTHING,</i>
<i>IT WAS EXACTLY</i>
<i>WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH.</i>
<i>I REALIZED IT WAS</i>
<i>THROUGH THE PLAYWRIGHT</i>
<i>THAT IF I COULD FIND THE
PLAYWRIGHT THAT WAS WRITING
<i>ABOUT WHAT I WAS FEELING</i>
<i>AS A HUMAN BEING,</i>
<i>THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD PURSUE.</i>
SHOULD BE LIKE, YEAH--
WHERE DO MY HANDS GO?
ALL RIGHT.
OK.
OK. AH...
(Sam) AND THEN
THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE LANGUAGE.
SO DON'T BURY
YOURSELVES IN IT.
SO IN ARIZONA, I--I--
AT A COMMUNITY THEATER,
I WENT ON STAGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
AND, UH, EVEN THOUGH
I WAS HORRIFIED,
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE WORST FEAR
YOU CAN HAVE IS GOING ON STAGE.
UH, THE MINUTE I GOT
OUT THERE, I KNEW I WAS HOME.
THIS IS WHERE I BELONGED.
ANTHONY ZERBE CAME TO
CAREER DAY AT MY HIGH SCHOOL
AND HE HAD
THESE ZIPPER BOOTS ON
THAT I THOUGHT
WERE PRETTY SLICK.
THIS WAS THE 70's.
AND, UH... MID '70s.
<i>AND HE TALKED ABOUT ACTING</i>
<i>AND IT SOUNDED</i> <i>LIKE A GOOD DEAL,</i>
<i>THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT IT,</i>
ESPECIALLY THE BOOTS HE WORE,
I THOUGHT WERE PRETTY GOOD.
THEN I STARTED MAKING SUPER 8
MOVIES, SORT OF MORE AS A DIRECTOR
AND SEARCHING FOR OTHER PEOPLE
WHO DIDN'T EXCEL AT HOMEWORK
SO THEY COULD BE FREE
TO DO STUFF AFTER SCHOOL,
<i>AND THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY,</i>
<i>SO I STARTED ACTING IN THEM.</i>
<i>AND NOW, HAVING PURCHASED</i>
<i>A PAIR OF THESE ACTOR BOOTS,</i>
<i>I WALKED THROUGH A SCENE,</i>
<i>MY FIRST SCENE THAT I PUT
MYSELF IN ONE OF THESE MOVIES
<i>AND I LOOKED DOWN</i>
<i>AND I SAW THESE BOOTS</i> <i>AND I SAID:</i>
"WELL, I MUST BE AN ACTOR".
THE ZIPPER BOOTS?
THE ZIPPER BOOTS DID IT.
I THINK I COULD MAYBE SAY,
THE FIRST TIME
IT OCCURRED TO ME
THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE
TO THINK OF YOURSELF AS AN ACTOR
IS AFTER SEEING BURT LANCASTER
IN A FILM CALLED, UH,
<i>VERA CRUZ</i>
WHEN I WAS ABOUT...
GOD, I MUST HAVE BEEN 10
OR SOMETHING.
AND I WALKED
OUT OF THE THEATER AND I STARTED TO,
YOU KNOW THAT THING
WHEN YOU'RE A KID
AND HOW YOU SEE
AN ACTOR ON SCREEN
AND, UH--UH, SOME PART
OF YOUR BODY
TAKES ON AN ASPECT
OF THE-- OF THE ACTOR?
AND THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT SMILE,
THAT BURT LANCASTER THING,
MY FACE WASN'T CONSTRUCTED
AT ALL LIKE HIS.
I MEAN, IT'S AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT KIND OF FACE.
BUT FOR SOME REASON, I STARTED
THIS--THIS THING WITH THE TEETH,
YOU KNOW,
THIS BURT LANCASTER THING,
AND I WAS CONVINCED INSIDE
THAT I LOOKED
OR HAD
THE SAME INTENTION
AS BURT LANCASTER.
<i>(Sam) AND I WALKED HOME</i>
<i>WITH THAT FEELING</i>
<i>THINKING I WAS</i>
<i>BURT LANCASTER.</i>
<i>BUT I WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED</i>
<i>THAT I HAD THAT TOOTHY SMILE.</i>
TO PARIS!
I DON'T FORGET A THING.
THAT CAPTAIN WAS LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I WAS ALREADY A DEAD MAN.
- YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.
- AM I?
I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK
TOO MANY TIMES NOT TO KNOW IT.
IF YOU TRUST ME
SO LITTLE--
I DON'T TRUST YOU
AT ALL.
ALL YOU WANT IS THAT GOLD,
BUT YOU WON'T GET IT WITHOUT ME.
I'M TAKING OVER THAT BOAT BEFORE
YOU EVER SET FOOT ABOARD HER.
SO, SHEILA?
(Sheila)
YEAH?
UH, YOU PIPE DOWN,
GRAB HIM, THROW...
<i>(Sam)</i>
<i>VERY EARLY I DISCOVERED</i> <i>THIS THING</i>
<i>THAT THEATER DOESN'T COUNT</i>
<i>UNTIL THE ACTOR</i> <i>GETS A HOLD OF IT.</i>
<i>THE THING ON PAPER</i>
<i>IS ONLY A BLUEPRINT</i>
<i>FOR THIS OTHER THING</i>
<i>THAT TAKES PLACE</i>
<i>BETWEEN THE ACTOR</i>
<i>AND THE AUDIENCE.</i>
<i>AND SO, YOU CAN NEVER BE</i>
<i>TOO MUCH ENRAPTURED</i>
<i>BY THE PAGE.</i>
<i>THAT IT'S NOT ONLY</i>
<i>IMPORTANT TO LET GO</i>
<i>BUT YOU HAVE TO LET GO,</i>
<i>LET THE ACTOR</i> <i>TAKE A HOLD OF IT.</i>
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
STICKING YOUR NOSE
IN MY BUSINESS?
HE SAW,
UH, A PRODUCTION
OF <i>BURIED CHILD</i> IN SANTA FE.
THEY WERE DOING IT
AND HE'D HEARD ABOUT IT AND HE
CAME TO PLAY, UH, RAYMOND DRUNK
AND SAT DOWN IN THE--
IN THE BACK
AND SOMEWHERE
IN THE COURSE OF THE FIRST ACT
HE STARTED TO VOICE HIS OPINIONS
ABOUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS
BEING REPRESENTED
ON STAGE
AND, UH, UH, BECAME QUITE
BELLIGERENT, I GUESS,
AND THEY KICKED HIM OUT.
AND THEN OUTSIDE, HE EXPLAINED
THAT HE WAS INDEED MY FATHER,
AND THEY LET HIM IN
AND HE WENT RIGHT ON AND HE SAID:
"THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WAS!"
SO HE HAD A FEW
OPINIONS ABOUT IT.
UH, EVIDENTLY IT WAS
A PRETTY WILD NIGHT
IN--IN THE SANTA FE
THEATER CIRCUIT,
BUT I WASN'T THERE
FOR IT, UNFORTUNATELY.
ANOTHER WEIRD THING
IS THAT WAY, WAY BACK,
HE WAS WORKING
IN THE WAREHOUSE
OF A-- OF A BOOKSTORE
SOMEWHERE, I'M NOT SURE WHERE,
AND MY FIRST BOOK CAME OUT.
AND HE SAW IT.
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE
IT WAS ME, YOU KNOW!
HE SAID, "THIS IS AN IMPOSTER!"
HE WAS WACKY.
(Sam)
I WAS BREAKING THE ICE WITH MYSELF.
I CAN REMEMBER
BEING DAZED WITH WRITING,
WITH THE DISCOVERY OF FINDING
I ACTUALLY HAD THESE
WORLDS INSIDE ME,
THESE VOICES,
SHAPES, CURRENTS
OF LANGUAGE, LIGHT,
ALL THE MYSTERIOUS ELEMENTS
THAT CAUSE ANYONE
TO MAKE A JOURNEY.
<i>(Sean)</i>
<i>SO, ESTEBAN,</i> <i>YOU'RE THE NEIGHBOR?</i>
<i>(Cheech)</i>
<i>YES, SIR.</i>
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
LIVED OVER THERE?
UM, 30 YEARS.
30 YEARS?
YES, SIR.
<i>MAS O MENOS.</i>
30 YEARS IN A TRAILER?
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
SO YOU'VE KNOWN MY FATHER
A GOOD LONG TIME THEN?
OH, OH, YES, SIR. UH,
EVER SINCE HE COME FROM CALIFORNIA,
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS
HAVING THAT BAD TIME.
WHAT BAD TIME
WAS THAT?
OH, WHEN HE--HE THINK
THE WORLD WAS TRYING TO EAT HIM.
WHAT?
UH, HE THINK THAT
HE WAS DOOMED, HE SAID.
DOOMED.
HE SAID THAT?
OH, YES, SIR.
"I HAVE TIMES LIKE THAT MYSELF".
OH, FUCK! I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TIMES
LIKE THAT MYSELF, YOU KNOW.
BUT MR. HENRY,
HE DON'T BELIEVE ME.
YOU KNOW, HE THINKS
HE'S THE ONLY ONE.
- DOOMED?
- YES, SIR.
CUT THE "SIR" SHIT.
I'M NOT YOUR SIR.
NOW WHAT DOES HE THINK,
THIS IS THE MILITARY OR SOMETHING?
I DON'T LIKE
THAT "SIR" STUFF.
(Nick) OH, LET HIM BE, HE'S
JUST BEING POLITE, YOU IDIOT.
IT'S A RARE THING
THESE DAYS.
POLITE?
POLITE.
YOU WANT A DRINK,
ESTEBAN?
(Sam)
YEAH, GOOD.
I THINK THAT'S-- YEAH, THAT'S--
THAT'S WORKING PRETTY GOOD.
OK, WHAM. GET RIGHT IN THERE.
RIGHT IN THERE.
JUST BREAK THIS THING UP, BREAK
THIS THING UP, GET IT BROKEN UP,
THEN--THEN
GET OUT OF THERE, OK?
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
I MEAN YOU KNOW IT...
I KNOW.
HE CAN GO OFF.
HE CAN GO LOONEY TUNES.
<i>(Sam)</i>
<i>ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS IS</i>
<i>WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING</i>
<i>A CORPSE ON STAGE,</i>
<i>LIKE</i> PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN
WORLD <i>OR ANY OF THESE GREAT PLAYS</i>
<i>THAT USE THE DEAD ON STAGE,</i>
<i>ONE--ONE OF THE INITIAL</i>
<i>PROBLEMS OF IT IS</i>
IT'S HARD FOR THE ACTOR
TO REMEMBER
THAT THE CORPSE
ACTUALLY I-I-IS THERE.
(Sean) COME HERE, NEIGHBOR,
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
WHAT ARE YOU...
COME HERE,
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THAT!
LOOK AT THAT!
COME ON,
TOUCH HIS FACE!
IT'S MR. HENRY.
THE MAN YOU'VE BEEN MAKING
SOUP FOR ALL THESE YEARS!
FEEL HOW COLD IT IS?
LIKE ICE,
LIKE A STONE IN THE RIVER.
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
A MAN WHO IS GOING
TO BE EATING
ANY MORE OF YOUR SOUP?
(Sam)
GOOD. GOOD.
IT'S EASY TO FORGET
THE DEAD IF THE DEAD
IS--IS--IS
A DONUT.
NICK, F-FIND, FIND WHAT
THIS THING IS DOWN HERE
NOW THAT THE--
NOW THAT THE CORPSE IS...
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENS HERE
ONCE THAT CORPSE IS TOUCHED?
YOU KNOW, I MEAN...
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? START...
FOCUS ON THAT.
YEAH, AND I THINK IT'S...
AND I THINK IT CAN BE--
IT CAN BE VERY QUIET,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
EXTREMELY INTENSE NOW.
(Sean) HENRY WAS A TOUGH
OLD BOOT, HE'D GO THROUGH
2 PINTS AND A 6-PACK
AND NEVER SKIPPED A BEAT.
NOW YOU TELL ME HE'S GONE UP
INTO THE MOUNTAINS ON SOME BINGE
WITH SOME INDIAN CHIPPY
AND DROPPED DEAD OVERNIGHT.
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME?
FUCKING ILLNESS!
CUMULATING ILLNESS!
HE WAS
A FUCKING ALCOHOLIC, RAY.
(Sean)
STOP THAT WHIMPERING.
WERE YOU-- WERE YOU
RELATED TO HIM?
I'M HIS SON AND YOU DON'T
SEE ME WHIMPERING, DO YOU?
YOU DON'T SEE ME DOING THAT.
(Nick)
I'VE GIVEN UP, RAY.
OR YOU, WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU GOT
SOME SPECIAL LINK WITH THE CORPSE?
(Nick)
WHY DID YOU EVEN COME HERE FOR?
(Sean) I JUST THOUGHT I'D
SEE HIM ONE MORE TIME ALIVE.
OH, YEAH, YOU THOUGHT YOU'D
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF SOMETHING.
CLEAR THINGS UP.
MAKE SOME BIG RECONCILIATION.
I DON'T NEED NO
RECONCILIATION.
I DON'T NEED ONE
WITH YOU, EITHER.
THAT'S GOOD, RAY.
(Sean)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
(Nick) I'M GOING DOWN
TO MAKE THAT PHONE CALL.
OH, OH, OH, WHAT PHONE CALL?
THE MEAT WAGON BOYS?
WHAT? HAS YOUR LITTLE PERIOD OF
MOURNING SUDDENLY COME TO AN END?
LET IT GO, RAY.
I'M NOT GOING TO
LET IT GO, EARL.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I'M YOUR WITNESS.
I AM YOUR
LONG-TIME WITNESS.
I AM YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.
I SAW IT ALL,
EARL, I SAW YOU.
SAW SHIT!
I SAW YOU!
I SAW YOU RUN!
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS,
ESTEBAN. I TRULY AM.
I HATE THIS KIND OF THING
MYSELF. IT'S FAMILY STUFF.
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THE MOST UPBEAT OF STORIES.
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,
I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH THAT.
MMM-HMM.
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY HAPPIER,
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT.
I DON'T THINK OF IT
IN THESE TERMS.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
I'VE READ A LOT
ABOUT THIS BEING
PART OF YOUR-- LIKE YOUR
STORY THAT YOU HAD TO TELL.
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS TRUE,
HOW MUCH OF IT IS YOUR STORY?
- MY STORY?
- YOUR STORY.
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, AGAIN, YOU KNOW,
PERCENTAGE WISE,
I THINK
IT'S 75 TO 80 PERCENT. 85...
I DON'T KNOW. PARTLY, SURE,
IT'S PARTLY PERSONAL, PARTLY NOT.
IT HAD TO COME OUT
OF A PERSONAL THING,
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN--IN--IN TRYING
TO TRANSLATE INTO
MY PERSONAL STORY.
MMM-HMM.
THE INTENTION OF
THE PLAY ISN'T TO, UH...
BACK OFF, WILL YOU?
BACK OFF.
SORRY.
SERIOUSLY,
THE INTENTION IS NOT TO
UH, NOT TO MAKE
A XEROX OF MY LIFE.
RIGHT. MMM-HMM.
<i>(Nick) I WAS IN THE
HOSPITAL IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA.
I HAD SPENT 4 DAYS
WITH MY MOTHER AS SHE DIED.
AND, UH, AFTER THAT PROCESS
I HAD SLEPT FOR 30 HOURS,
WOKE UP WITH PNEUMONIA.
I HAD--HAD BLOWN OUT
MY LEG IN AN ACCIDENT.
NOT AN ACCIDENT, BUT...
I KNEW MY MOTHER WAS DYING AND
I WAS TERRIFICALLY ANGRY ABOUT IT.
DIDN'T WANT TO FACE IT.
AND I BLEW THE CALF OUT,
RIPPED THE PLANTAR FASCIA
AND THEN I HAD
CALLED MY MOTHER
AND I SAID I'D BE THERE ON FRIDAY
AND THIS WAS ON A SUNDAY,
AND SHE SAID, "OH, THAT LONG?"
SO I KNEW
I HAD TO BE RIGHT AWAY.
SO I TOOK
A FRIEND OF MINE, MATT,
AND WE FLEW DOWN TO PHOENIX
AND I SAT WITH HER
FOR 4 DAYS WHILE SHE DIED.
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST
EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER-- THAT I'VE HAD
BECAUSE SHE LITERALLY
SHOWED ME HOW TO DIE.
<i>(Nick)</i>
<i>AND THIS WAS</i> <i>DURING THE WEEK,</i>
<i>AND ON MONDAY,</i>
<i>WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE</i>
<i>IN SAN FRANCISCO, UH,</i>
<i>FOR THE READ-THROUGH</i>
<i>AND ON FRIDAY, I SAID TO MATT,
THEY HAD GOT TUBES
RUNNING IN ME AND EVERYTHING,
I SAID, "I BETTER CALL
SAM SHEPARD AND TELL HIM".
I CALLED SAM AND I SAID, YOU KNOW,
"SAM, I'M IN THE HOSPITAL
IN PHOENIX.
"I'VE GOT PNEUMONIA
AND MY MOTHER JUST DIED.
AND I RIPPED MY LEG UP AND I
DON'T KNOW IF I CAN REALLY WALK".
AND HE SAID, "WELL, WHY ARE
YOU TELLING ME THIS?"
AND I SAID, "I THOUGHT YOU
SHOULD KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES".
AND SAM SAID, "WHY DON'T WE
JUST PRETEND NONE OF IT HAPPENED?"
AND I SAID,
"OK, I'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY".
WHAT IS IT?
IS--IS, UH, NICK HERE?
THERE HE IS. THERE'S NICK.
UH, LET'S SIT AROUND
FOR A MINUTE
'CAUSE I HAVE TO CUT
SOME STUFF ON THIS.
YEAH.
(Sam)
HOW YOU DOING, NICK?
(Nick)
GOOD. SEE YOUR BOY?
YEAH, I WENT UP AND SPENT
THE DAY WITH HIM UP THERE.
IT WAS GREAT.
(Nick) MINE HAD ABOUT
5 WORDS TO SAY TO ME.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US ABOUT IT?
(Sam)
WH-WHERE DID YOU SEE HIM?
UH, BACK DOWN IN L.A.
OH, BACK DOWN IN L.A.?
HE HAD A PARTY
LAST WEEKEND
AND A FEW LAMPS GOT BROKEN.
HOW OLD IS HE?
HE'S 14.
AND HE THOUGHT I WAS GONNA TEAR
INTO HIM, SO HE WAS REAL QUIET.
HE CLEANED IT UP
AND FELT GUILTY.
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,
BUT I COULD SEE
HE WAS JUST SITTING BACK.
REALLY?
YEAH.
HE SAID, "WELL, DAD, I'M GONNA
STAY AT MOM'S. I'LL SEE YOU LATER".
I SAID, "I FLEW ALL THE WAY DOWN
HERE TO SEE YOU FOR 10 MINUTES.
IS THAT THE DEAL?"
YEAH, YOU NEVER KNOW
HOW THAT'S GONNA GO.
YEAH, I KNOW.
LET ME GIVE YOU
THE FIRST CUT
BECAUSE IT'S
BETWEEN EARL AND RAY.
SO YOU GOT...
SEAN, YOU GOT YOUR SCRIPT?
RIGHT HERE.
ON PAGE 20,
WHERE EARL SAYS "GROW UP,"
I WANT TO CUT THAT LITTLE SECTION.
SO WE'LL JUST GO FROM...
WE'LL GO DIRECTLY FROM EARL:
"GO FUCK YOURSELF, RAY"
TO "SO WHO'S
THIS CRAZY CHICK?"
TOMORROW WE'RE AT
THEATRE ON THE SQUARE AT NOON.
EVERYONE AT NOON, WE'RE GONNA
START WITH A LITTLE VOCAL WORK.
NOW, TOMORROW IS
AN 8-HOUR DAY, 12:00 TO 8:00,
BUT THEREAFTER,
BE PREPARED FOR LONGER HOURS.
WE'LL BE GOING
INTO THE EVENING.
WELL, YES, UH...
I GOTTA BE WITH MY KIDS
HALLOWEEN NIGHT
OR I WON'T BE ALIVE
FOR THE OPENING NIGHT ANYWAY.
(Sam)
TUESDAY IS HALLOWEEN? WHAT TIME
YOU NEED TO GET BACK BY...
I SHOULD BE BACK BY BEFORE...
JUST BEFORE IT GETS DARK.
YEAH, OK,
WE'LL JUST, UH...
WE CAN WORK
A SHORT DAY, UM...
93 ARE, UM,
SIGNATURE SCALLOPS,
OK, 94.
(James)
DO I LOOK LIKE A DEAD MAN OR WHAT?
NO, SIR.
NOT THE LEAST BIT, HUH?
NOT AROUND THE EYES
A LITTLE?
LOOK AROUND THE EYES.
LOOK CLOSELY HERE.
COME OVER AND GIVE IT
A GOOD HARD LOOK-SEE.
NO, YOU GOT TO
GET IN HERE, CLOSE.
NOW, LOOK RIGHT
DEEP INTO THE PUPILS
WHERE IT'S DARK,
WHERE IT DROPS OFF
INTO NOWHERE.
YOU SEE THAT?
RIGHT STRAIGHT IN THERE
LIKE YOU'RE RIDING
A TRAIN INTO A BLACK HOLE.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SEE.
(Sam) I THOUGHT WHAT WE
NEEDED TO DO THIS MORNING
IS JUST HAVE
A SPEED-THROUGH.
SO LET'S JUST FIRE AWAY
AND--AND GO PURELY FOR SPEED.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT CHARACTER,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT NOTHING.
JUST GO FOR SPEED,
SPEED, SPEED.
IT'S LIKE
A 3-FURLONG RACE, OK?
OPEN THE GATES AND GO.
(Nick)
READY?
(Sean)
YEAH, RIGHT, I REMEMBER.
- AGE?
- YEAH.
- WHOSE AGE?
- MINE.
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT HIS.
NO, I MEAN,
GETTING OLDER, YOU KNOW?
"I MEAN, WHEN I WAS 18,
19, I USED TO..."
YOU HIT A HURDLE.
"HE HAD SOME PROBLEMS
BUT I THOUGHT HE'D
PULL HIMSELF TOGETHER.
"OTHERWISE,
WE'D NEVER CALL HIM.
WELL, WE BETTER
MAKE THAT PHONE CALL".
(Woody) "IF IT DOESN'T
WORK OUT, I CAN ALWAYS
GET IN ON A MIDNIGHT..."
"I'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT IT,
BELIEVE ME. 2:00 OR 3:00 A.M,
SOMETIMES YOU
GET A DELIVERY..."
WHAT?
(Woody) "DOOR WAS OPEN,
SO I JUST LET MYSELF IN
"AND THERE HE WAS,
LYING ON HIS SIDE
ON THE BED THERE
SOBBIN' LIKE..."
"IT STILL SEEMS SO
WEIRD TO BE SAYING THAT
"WHEN I DON'T SEE
THAT HE'S ON HIS SIDE IN THE BED,
AND IT'S LIKE NOW I'VE TURNED
AND COME BACK INTO THE NEW--"
WHERE IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
ON THIS PAGE?
72.
YOU MIGHT GET AWAY WITH THAT
SHIT IN <i>WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP.</i>
(Sam)
THE PLAY IS THE THING.
(Sean) YEAH, IT IS WEIRD
BUT IT'S A CHANGE IN--
YOU HAD AN UNDERRATED
PERFORMANCE IN <i>SHANGHAI SURPRISE.</i>
HIM AND THE MATERIAL GIRL.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
(Woody) "I'M ORIGINALLY FROM
TEXAS. TEXAS-BORN AND RAISED".
(Sean) "TEXANS DON'T WHINE.
THERE'S NO WHINERS
IN TEXAS.
THREW THEM ALL OUT".
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT IT?
MY GREAT-GREAT GRANDMOTHER
WAS SLAUGHTERED BY COMANCHES.
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
FROM TEXAS ALL RIGHT.
GREAT-GREAT
GRANDMOTHER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
GREAT-GREAT GRANDMOTHER
WAS SLAUGHTERED BY COMANCHES.
SOUNDS LIKE A STORY
TO ME.
A STORY?
FABRICATION PASSED ON
FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT.
SOUNDS LIKE
THAT KIND OF STORY.
UH, PRIDEFUL STORY.
PRIDEFUL?
THERE'S NOTHING
PRIDEFUL ABOUT THIS ONE.
THING ABOUT THAT KIND OF STORY
IS THAT THE ORIGINAL FABRICATOR,
THE FIRST LIAR
WHO MADE THIS UP
ABOUT YOUR
GREAT-GREAT GRANDMOTHER,
HE'S DEAD AND GONE NOW.
SO THERE'S NO WAY
TO VERIFY THIS LITTLE STORY
OF YOURS.
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME
I'M LYING, ARE YOU?
YOUR FAMILY IS A PACK OF
LIARS, THEY WERE BORN LIARS.
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
TO GET TO THE HEART OF THINGS.
SOMEBODY, SOMETIME HAS GOT TO GET
TO THE HEART OF THINGS. JALAPENO?
NO, THANK YOU.
NO, YOU'RE FROM TEXAS,
YOU CAN TAKE THE HEAT.
T-BONE BURNETT.
NOVEMBER 5TH,
SAM'S BIRTHDAY, 2000.
WE HOOKED UP
IN NEW YORK CITY,
UH, WHEN WE WERE DOING A SHOW
TOGETHER FOR BOB DYLAN CALLED
<i>THE ROLLING THUNDER REVIEW.</i>
SAM WAS WRITING
A FILM FOR THE TOUR
<i>AND, UH,</i>
<i>I WAS PLAYING GUITAR.</i>
I'M DOING THE SCORE ACTUALLY
UNDERNEATH THE--THE PLAY.
<i>BUT WHAT</i>
<i>WE STARTED WORKING ON</i>
<i>WAS PUTTING THESE</i>
<i>RHYTHMS AND THESE TONES</i>
<i>BEHIND THE RHYTHMS</i>
<i>AND THE TONES OF THE DIALOGUE,</i>
<i>AND AS SOON AS YOU DO THAT,</i>
<i>IT ACTUALLY BECOMES A SONG.</i>
YOU SEE HIM NOW?
YOU SEE HOW HE LOOKS?
HELPLESS.
OH, BABY.
BREATHE.
I WISH HE WERE DEAD.
<i>(Burnett)</i> <i>SO I GOT INTO THIS
TUNING</i> <i>AND THIS VIBE, THIS DRONE.</i>
<i>WE'VE SORT OF TAKEN THAT
DRONE AND ARE EXPANDING IT
<i>INTO THIS ATMOSPHERE.</i>
<i>YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK</i>
<i>ABOUT ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC.</i>
<i>ALL MUSIC IS ATMOSPHERIC.</i>
THAT SMELL.
SMELL?
WHAT SMELL?
THAT--THAT...
BOOZE?
NO.
WHAT THEN?
SOME--
SOME SCENT OF YOU.
(James)
A SCENT?
YOU MEAN,
LIKE A DOG OR SOMETHING?
NO.
YOU MEAN LIKE A DOG,
DON'T YOU?
(Sam)
YEAH, I THINK WE SHOULD USE IT.
DON'T YOU?
(Woody)
YEAH.
BEAUTIFUL.
JALAPENOS.
CAN'T STAY ALIVE ON
PEPPERS AND HOOCH.
HOW DO WE GET A HOLD
OF THIS TAXICAB DRIVER?
WHAT?
THE TAXI DRIVER WHO CAME
TO PICK DAD UP?
WELL, YOU GOT ME. I GUESS
YOU'D HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHAT COMPANY
HE WORKS FOR FIRST.
(Sam) OK, I KNOW THE
ENERGY IS DIFFERENT NOW,
BUT YESTERDAY
WE HAD THIS THING GOING.
I THINK WE
SHOULD... "JALAPENOS?"
"HOW DO WE GET A HOLD
OF THIS TAXICAB DRIVER?"
IT STARTED THIS...
IT STARTED THIS
WHOLE RHYTHM, YOU KNOW?
I THINK THAT'S THE TICKET.
(Sean)
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BORE MYSELF.
BUT THEN YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
WE GOTTA KEEP THEM IN.
THESE ARE GREAT,
BY THE WAY.
YOU'RE NOT HELPING.
WHATEVER THE HELL
THEY ARE.
(Sam)
THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.
SHIT, I'D BETTER HAVE ONE.
UH, JUST
FOR THE SAKE OF, UH,
OF THE RHYTHMIC THING,
CAN WE TRY THAT?
JESUS CHRIST.
(Sam) IF YOU DON'T EAT THE
SEEDS, YOU WON'T SUFFER.
(Sean) THE CAB DRIVER
WHO CAME TO PICK HIM UP.
<i>(Sean)</i>
<i>LOOK, SOME</i> <i>OF THE GREAT DIRECTORS</i>
<i>NEVER WROTE ANYTHING.</i>
<i>THERE'S NO QUESTION</i>
<i>THAT PEOPLE CAN</i> <i>DIRECT VERY WELL.</i>
<i>BUT FROM</i>
<i>AN ACTOR'S POINT OF VIEW,</i>
YOU KNOW, IF HE WROTE IT,
THERE'S NO PLACE IT CAN TAKE YOU,
UH, THAT ISN'T THE CAPTAIN OF THE
SHIP BEING WILLING TO GO DOWN.
I MEAN, THERE'S NO QUESTION
THAT WHATEVER HE HAD TO LIVE
THROUGH TO WRITE THIS THING
WAS WORSE THAN
ANYTHING I CAN FEEL
OR ANYWHERE
I CAN GO AS AN ACTOR.
SO IT'S FAIR.
IT'S FAIR.
HE CAN ASK, I CAN...
I'D DO MY BEST.
AND THAT'S TRUE
FOR THE OTHER ACTORS.
AND THAT'S WHERE
IT'S CLOSER.
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S WHERE YOU
APPLY YOUR HEART,
UH, AND YOU KNOW
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH IN THE FIRST PLACE.
WHEN I GET TO, UH--UH, SAY,
"A DROWNED MAN".
MMM-HMM.
BECAUSE I'M--I'M--I'M
DOING THAT FOR HIM.
YOU KNOW,
I'M ALSO DOING THIS,
I'M GETTING HENRY
TO THE OTHER SIDE,
I'M TAKING HIM OVER THERE, BUT
I'M EXPLAINING IT TO HIM, YOU KNOW.
MMM-HMM.
SO I SAY, "A DROWNED MAN,
HE COMES UP FOR AIR, HE GASPS".
I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS
SOME CUT IN BETWEEN THERE.
I FEEL LIKE... NOW I SAY,
"NOW HE BEGINS TO GO BACK HOME",
I ALMOST WANT TO SAY, "BUT IT'S
TOO LATE," OR, "NOW HE BEGINS..."
WAS THERE A LINE
IN BETWEEN THERE?
HE HAD A LINE.
YEAH, THERE WAS
SOMETHIN' IN THERE.
WAS IT "STOP IT"?
NO. YEAH, IT WAS JUST LIKE
"STOP IT" OR SOMETHING.
BUT THERE WAS THAT
SECTION WE TOOK OUT ABOUT
"YOU WISH YOUR
FATHER WOULD LIVE".
MMM-HMM. -YEAH.
-YEAH.
YOU THINK YOU NEED
THIS STUFF BACK HERE?
"YOUR FATHER.
I WILL SHOW YOU YOUR FATHER.
"I'LL SHOW WHAT
HE'S MADE OF..."
"YOU SEE HIM NOW?
YOU SEE HOW HE LOOKS TO YOU?"
<i>(Sam)</i>
<i>THE MYSTERY OF THE ACTOR</i>
<i>IS GONNA ALWAYS</i>
<i>REMAIN EXTRAORDINARY.</i>
<i>BUT EVEN A DEEPER MYSTERY IS HOW
TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ACTOR.
IN A WAY,
IT CAN BE FRIGHTENING,
IN SUCH A WAY THAT
YOU'RE SO-- YOU ARE SO INTIMIDATED
BY TRYING TO GET
INTO THIS TERRITORY
THAT'S VERY FRAGILE
IN A DIALOGUE
AND MAKE WORDS OUT OF IT,
THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF,
UH, MUTE.
AND A LOT OF TIMES,
I FEEL THAT WAY.
I FEEL LIKE I--I--I
KNOW THE TERRITORY
I WANT TO ENTER
WITH THE ACTOR,
BUT I CAN'T FIND
THE LANGUAGE, YOU KNOW.
SO FINDING THE LANGUAGE,
I THINK
IS ONE OF THE MOST
INCREDIBLE PARTS OF IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS FACED IN
THIS CONDITION OF TRUST, YOU KNOW,
UH, AND--AND IT'S LIKE
INCHES AWAY FROM MISTRUST.
<i>(Sam)</i> <i>IF YOU FAIL</i>
<i>IN THE LANGUAGE ONE TIME,</i>
<i>IT'S LIKE WITH A HORSE,</i>
<i>HE CAN KILL YOU.</i>
<i>A HORSE'LL JUST TURN AROUND</i>
<i>AND WIPE YOU OUT.</i>
(Sam)
I THINK WHAT WE NEED HERE IS, LIKE,
IF YOU TAKE-- IF YOU TAKE HIM
DOWN WITH "DROWNED MAN",
TAKE HIM ALL THE WAY DOWN
WITH "DROWNED MAN",
HE COMES UP FOR AIR
AND BRING HIM BACK UP.
AND JIM,
IF YOU COULD-- IF YOU COULD
GET INTO THIS GASP THING.
I THINK WE NEED
SOMETHING THERE FROM YOU.
RIGHT AS SHE SAYS, "GASPS".
GASP. SOME SORT
OF A GASP.
I GOTTA
GIVE YOU A GASP.
YEAH, GIVE ME A BIG GASP.
(Woody) HEY, CAN I
ASK YOU ONE QUESTION, SAM?
(Sam)
YEAH.
IS THIS 4th WALL HERE MEANT TO
BE, LIKE, LOOKING OUT A WINDOW?
NO, NO, NO, NO.
UH, I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE
AN ANCIENT CONCEPT
THAT WE'VE MANAGED TO DESTROY
IN THE LAST CENTURY.
RIGHT, BUT IF SOMEONE'S
COMING AND LOOKING OUT--
THAT, TO ME,
IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MODERN THEATER
AND THE OLD STUFF.
YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE EVER SINCE, LIKE...
WELL,
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN GOING
QUITE A WHILE,
LIKE BRECHT
AND ALL THOSE GUYS.
THE THEATRE IS...
THE AUDIENCE IS HERE.
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DENY
THAT THE AUDIENCE IS HERE.
THE AUDIENCE IS HERE
AND WE'RE AWARE OF IT
AND WE'RE PRESENT
TO IT AS ACTORS, YOU KNOW,
AND AS-- AND AS WRITERS.
AND--AND THE WHOLE NOTION THAT
WE'RE DOING SOME ILLUSION UP THERE
THAT'S DISCONNECTED
TO LIVING PEOPLE,
AND THAT PEOPLE OUT HERE ARE
LIKE VOYEURS LOOKING THROUGH A...
IS--IS PRETTY MUCH GONE.
IT'S THE THING
OF THE PAST.
YOU'RE AN ACTOR
AND A CHARACTER AT THE SAME TIME.
SO, YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY SENSE
TRYING TO DENY THAT
THE AUDIENCE IS THERE.
BRECHT WAS BIG ON THAT,
ADDRESSING THEM JUST LIKE... WHAM!
JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I OWE A GREAT DEAL TO PEOPLE
LIKE JOE CHAIKIN,
PETER BROOK AND GROTOWSKI.
I MEAN, I'VE GOT A LOT
OF PEOPLE BEHIND ME, YOU KNOW.
AND I DIDN'T INVENT...
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
<i>I HAD A LONG HISTORY</i>
<i>WITH JOE CHAIKIN</i>
<i>FROM THE VERY BEGINNINGS</i>
<i>OF THE OPEN THEATER.</i>
<i>I JUST FEEL LIKE IT WAS A PRIVILEGE
TO HAVE BEEN IN HIS PRESENCE
<i>FROM THE GET-GO THROUGH
WORKING WITH HIM OVER THE YEARS
<i>AS A WRITER, YOU KNOW,</i>
<i>AND AS A FRIEND.</i>
<i>I MEAN, THE WHOLE DEAL HAS
BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY.
<i>HE INCLUDED IT ALL.</i>
<i>HE SAID,</i>
<i>"LET'S INCLUDE THE CIRCUS,</i>
<i>"LET'S INCLUDE JAPANESE THEATER,
LET'S INCLUDE STRASBERG,
<i>"LET'S INCLUDE ARTAUD</i>
<i>AND--AND FIND ALL OF</i>
<i>THE POSSIBILITIES".</i>
<i>SO SUDDENLY THERE'S ANOTHER
WAY OF LOOKING AT ACTORS.
(James)
KNOCK IT OFF! KNOCK IT OFF!
HE DOESN'T NEED
ANY BOUNCING.
HE LOOKS TO ME LIKE A MAN
WHO COULD USE SOME BOUNCING.
LOOK HOW FLAT HE IS.
IF THERE'S ANY
BOUNCING GOING ON HERE,
I'LL BE THE ONE
IN CHARGE OF IT.
(Sheila)
SO YOU'LL BE THE ONE?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'LL BE THE ONE
IN CHARGE OF BOUNCING?
THE CAPTAIN OF BOUNCING.
I DIDN'T KNOW DEAD MEN
WERE ANY GOOD AT BOUNCING.
I THOUGHT THEIR
BOUNCING DAYS WERE OVER.
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN!
<i>(Sam)</i>
<i>THESE GREAT ACTORS</i> <i>WERE AROUND,</i>
<i>STEVEN REA, BOB HOSKINS,</i>
<i>BEFORE THEY'D</i>
<i>EVER DONE ANY MOVIES.</i>
<i>THEY WERE SO SUPERB,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW.</i>
<i>IT WAS SORT OF LIKE</i>
<i>JUST BEARING WITNESS,</i> <i>YOU KNOW.</i>
<i>SO I JUST SAT THERE
AND WATCHED THESE GUYS
<i>PUT IT TOGETHER, YOU KNOW,
<i>AND THAT'S REALLY</i>
<i>WHERE--WHERE I STARTED.</i>
HE PROBABLY
AS AN AMERICAN WRITER
AND CERTAINLY AS A--
AS A DRAMATIST, YOU KNOW,
IS THE GUY WHO HAS
HIT IT THE MOST POTENTLY,
HAVING TO DO WITH
THIS PERIOD OF TIME,
IT'S JUST THAT THE, UH,
THE PLIGHT OF, UH,
OF BEING A MAN
WHERE BEING A MAN
DOESN'T HAVE ANY DEFINITION.
<i>(Sean)</i> <i>THE WAY THAT THINGS</i>
<i>LIKE VIOLENCE HAS BECOME</i>
<i>LIKE A CRY OUT OF</i>
<i>SOMETHING DEAD AND PAST.</i>
(Sean)
I SAW YOU RUN.
(Sam)
YEAH, OK.
(Sean)
THIS IS WHERE I AM COMPLETELY...
ALL THIS
BACK-PEDALING AT HIS SPEED--
(Sam)
AT HIS MERCY, YEAH.
IT'S GOING-- IT'S GOING TO
GET A LITTLE--
MY--MY FEELING IS THAT
INSTEAD OF THE SLANT
THAT YOU-- THAT YOU TAKE A-- TAKE A
HOLD OF IT. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IF--IF YOU COME
AND YOU TAKE HIM LIKE HERE
AND THROWN HIM
DOWN HERE, YOU KNOW?
FOOTBALL PLAYER.
I THOUGHT YOU
PLAYED FOOTBALL.
NO, I DID A FILM.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A NEBRASKA FOOTBALL STAR.
NO.
THAT RUMOR HAS
BEEN GOING AROUND FOR 30 YEARS.
HE'S A MIDWESTERN
NEBRASKA FOOTBALL STAR.
PLAYED IN HIGH SCHOOL.
(Sam) SHIT, I THINK YOU
SHOULD KEEP THAT RUMOR GOING.
I AM YOUR LONG-TIME WITNESS.
I SAW YOU.
YOU SAW NOTHING!
I SAW YOU!
I SAW YOU RUN!
MAN, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING,
YOU'RE NOTHING
LIKE YOUR FATHER.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN HIM.
AT LEAST WITH HENRY,
YOU COULD HAVE
A CONVERSATION.
<i>(Nick)</i> <i>HE WAS A REAL GREAT</i>
<i>CONVERSATIONALIST, WASN'T HE?</i>
<i>REAL DIFFERENT.</i>
<i>YEAH, WELL, MAYBE.</i>
I WAS THE ONLY ONE.
HE DON'T HAVE NOBODY ELSE.
SOMETIMES,
LATE AT NIGHT, I'D COME OVER
AND WE'D SIT, WE'D SIT
RIGHT HERE AT THIS TABLE
FACING THE MOON,
LISTEN TO THE RADIO.
YOU KNOW?
WE DON'T TALK, WE DON'T SPEAK
FOR HOURS, SOMETIMES,
JUST LISTEN TO MUSIC
FROM DEEP IN MEXICO.
YOU SAID
YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS, RIGHT?
YOU WERE SAYING
YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS.
(Cheech)
OH, YEAH, SOMETIMES.
SOMETIMES HE WOULD
ASK ME ABOUT MY <i>PUEBLO,</i>
WHERE I COME FROM,
MY PEOPLE, MY FAMILY.
HE NEVER TALK ABOUT HIMSELF.
HE SAY, "I HAVE NO PAST".
MOSTLY WE JUST LISTEN,
YOU KNOW, DOGS, COYOTE, <i>LA MUSICA.</i>
HMM, IT WAS PEACEFUL.
PEACEFUL? HENRY?
JUST THE TWO OF US.
(Nick)
PEACEFUL. THAT'D BE SOMETHING.
WHAT?
PEACE.
MMM.
THAT SON OF A BITCH
TOOK EVERYTHING.
THE TOOLS AND THE ALBUM AND THE
BOTTLE. HE TOOK THE DAMN BOTTLE.
HE DIDN'T DESERVE
ANY OF THAT STUFF. THAT WAS MINE.
I INHERITED IT
FAIR AND SQUARE.
I WAS THE ONE THAT STUCK IT
OUT HERE WITH HENRY, NOT HIM.
(Cheech) I'M VERY SORRY YOU
MISSED HIM, I WANT TO SAY GOODBYE.
- WHO?
- MR. HENRY!
HE WAS DEAD. YOU DON'T SAY
GOODBYE TO A DEAD MAN.
IT'S TOO LATE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT MY BROTHER,
MY LIVING, BREATHING,
CONNIVING BROTHER.
IN MY VILLAGE YOU ALWAYS
SAY GOODBYE TO THE DEAD.
THIS IS NOT YOUR VILLAGE.
YOU'RE ACROSS THE RIVER HERE.
WELL,
THEY'LL COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU
IF YOU DON'T SAY GOODBYE TO THEM.
KNOCK IT OFF WITH THAT.
DEAD IS DEAD, ALL RIGHT?
FINISHED. <i>TERMINADO.</i>
MAYBE.
(Sam)
ALL RIGHT, LET'S, UH, LET IT SOAK.
GOOD WORK. <i>MANANA.</i>
TOMORROW WE START
AT 10:00, I GUESS.
(Nick)
WHAT ARE WE STARTING TOMORROW?
UH, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO A TECH RUN-THROUGH,
SO WE'LL TRY TO
JUST CHOP AWAY AND--AND--AND,
UH, DO AS MUCH
LIGHT CHECK AS WE CAN.
IT'S ALWAYS A PAIN IN THE ASS
BUT WE GOT TO DO IT.
(Sam) BACK THIS UP JUST A SECOND,
AND DO THIS, DO THIS LAST...
YEAH, SEAN IS ON THIS SIDE.
THAT'S PRETTY. THAT'S NICE.
MAYBE IT SHOULD GO
IN 2-- IN 2, STAGES, LIKE THAT
AND THEN FADE DOWN,
YOU THINK?
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT MEMORY.
SO, UH,
126 AT 0.
ALL RIGHT. NOW WE GOT
IT THERE ON THE TUB.
<i>(Anne)</i>
<i>ANNE MILITELLO.</i> <i>LIGHTING DESIGNER.</i>
- 94.
- 94, IS THAT?
KILL 94.
<i>(Anne)</i>
<i>WHEN I WENT TO NEW YORK,</i>
<i>SAM TOLD ME</i>
<i>TO LOOK UP JOHNNY DODD</i>
<i>WHO HAD WORKED WITH SAM IN
THE '60s, AND HE BECAME MY MENTOR
AND TOOK ME INTO A WORLD
THAT WAS--WAS SERIOUS ART
WITH A TOUCH OF THE BIZARRE
AND, YES, BIZARRE IS
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IT.
AND KIND OF, UM,
YOU KNOW, DADA-ESQUE.
<i>(Sam)</i> <i>AND IN THOSE DAYS,
LIKE,</i> <i>IT WAS NOT COMPUTERIZED,</i>
IT WASN'T THE KIND OF THING
WHERE YOU PUNCH THE NUMBERS
AND THE LIGHTS TAKE
CARE OF THEMSELVES.
ALL THE LIGHTS
ARE-- WERE HAND-OPERATED.
SO HERE'S THIS GUY
WHO'S ALSO STONED, I BELIEVE.
RIGHT.
ANYHOW,
HE WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME.
HE WAS, LIKE, PLAYING, AS THE
ACTOR WAS GOING THROUGH STUFF.
HE WAS, LIKE, HE WAS
MOVING THE LIGHTS, YOU KNOW,
AND I JUST STOOD
BEHIND HIM FOR A WHILE AND WATCHED
AND THOUGHT,
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE
BECAUSE HERE IS A GUY
WHO IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH AN ACTOR,
EVERY BIT AS MUCH A PART OF
THE SHOW ITSELF AS THE ACTOR.
IN FACT,
IS FOLLOWING THE ACTOR...
YEAH.
...MOVING WITH THE ACTOR
AND CONDUCTING THE LIGHT.
AND I THOUGHT, "WOW, MAN, THIS
IS REALLY... THIS IS AN ARTIST".
YOU COULD STOP...
I'LL TAKE THE DRINK.
YEAH.
COME OFF THE DRINK.
PLEASE, STOP, YOU KNOW.
FIRST THING I--I SEE
IS THE BOTTLE, THEN I--I SEE HIM.
YEAH.
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
HE WAS KICKING HER.
HE WAS KICKING HER.
EVERY TIME HE KICKED HER,
HIS RAGE GREW A LITTLE BIT
AND HIS FACE CHANGED,
BLOOD BULGED OUT OF HIS FACE
AND HER BLOOD WENT FLYING
ALL OVER THE KITCHEN.
IT WASN'T ME, IT WAS HIM.
IT WAS HIM!
STILL, I KEPT THINKING
SOONER OR LATER
EARL'S GOING TO STEP IN.
EARL'S GOING TO STOP IT.
I NEVER RAN, I NEVER RAN!
(Sam)
OK, HOLD IT, PLEASE. HOLD IT.
UM, WE GOTTA,
UM, ANNIE.
(Anne)
YEAH.
I'VE GOT A FEELING THAT--THAT
THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THE FLOOR.
UH.
IT SEEMS TO BE BOUNCING.
I KNOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT, SAM?
I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE FLOOR
AND I THINK
WHEN HE PAINTS IT THAT MATTE--
HE WHAT?
HE'S GOT TO PAINT IT
DOWN FROM THE GLOSS
TO THE MATTE
SO IT DOESN'T BOUNCE UP. 'CAUSE...
YEAH.
IS THERE ANY WAY
TO CUT IT MORE?
THE FLOOR HAS JUST GOT
TO COME DOWN BECAUSE--
THE FLOOR IS SO BOUNCY.
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
EVERYTHING'S JUST, WHOOP.
I JUST THINK WE LOSE...
ALL THE DRAMA GOES OUT OF IT
WHEN THE FLOOR'S
BOUNCIN' LIKE THAT.
OK, DO WE NEED A BREAK
OR CAN WE SOLDIER ON HERE?
<i>(Cheech)</i> <i>I'M VERY SORRY.</i>
<i>I WANTED TO SAY GOODBYE.</i>
WHO?
<i>MR. HENRY.</i>
HE IS DEAD.
WHO SAYS GOODBYE
TO A DEAD MAN?
IT'S TOO LATE.
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT MY BROTHER.
MY LIVIN', BREATHIN',
CONNIVING BROTHER.
<i>IN MY VILLAGE</i>
<i>WE ALWAYS SAY GOODBYE</i> <i>TO THE DEAD.</i>
THIS IS NOT YOUR VILLAGE.
RIGHT ACROSS THE RIVER HERE.
<i>THEY WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT
YOU IF YOU DO NOT SAY GOODBYE.
KNOCK IT OFF WITH THAT.
(Woody)
I REALIZE I'M A PERIPHERAL CHARACTER
AND I'M TRYING TO
STAY IN THE PERIPHERY.
BUT I THINK THAT THERE MIGHT
BE SOMETHING FUNNY IN THE...
YOU KNOW SOMETHIN'...
FOR A PERIPHERAL
CHARACTER, THAT WAS GREAT.
THEY WARNED ME
ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE YOU!
<i>(Sam)</i> <i>EVERYTHING CONVERGES</i>
<i>IN MUSIC, ALL OF IT.</i>
<i>THEATER, DIRECTING,</i>
<i>ACTING, AND IN WRITING.</i>
<i>ALL THE LAWS OF MUSIC,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW, RHYTHM,</i>
<i>DYNAMICS, HARMONIES, DISCORD.</i>
<i>EVERYTHING. IT ALL SOMEHOW</i>
<i>CONVERGES IN MUSIC.</i>
I'D RATHER BE A MUSICIAN,
BUT I'M NOT. SO...
ME, TOO.
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THEATER,
BUT I FELL INTO IT, YOU KNOW.
I LIKE DIALOGUE.
AND I DO THINK THIS THING OF A
LIVE AUDIENCE AND A LIVE ACTOR
IS--IS AN-- CAN BE AN
EXTRAORDINARY MEETING,
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE
DEADLY AND DULL AS HELL.
BUT WHEN--WHEN THE 2 THINGS,
WHEN--WHEN THEY COLLIDE
AND SOMETHING STARTS HAPPENING,
IT'S--IT'S QUITE AMAZING.
(Sam) LET'S, UH, LET'S ORGANIZE
THIS CURTAIN CALL A LITTLE BIT.
OK, AND 2 BOWS.
ONE.
2 BOWS, OK.
AND BACK AGAIN.
AND THE 3rd ONE, THE WHOLE LINE
COME FORWARD AGAIN. OK?
AND WE ALL COME BACK?
ON THE 3rd ONE, YEAH.
EVERYBODY BACK
ON THE 3rd ONE.
GOOD.
<i>OK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</i>
<i>CAN I HAVE</i>
<i>YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?</i>
<i>WE ARE BREAKING NOW</i>
<i>FOR THE AFTERNOON.</i>
<i>WE ARE BACK</i>
<i>THIS EVENING AT 6:30</i>
<i>TO DRESS FOR</i>
<i>A 7:00 RUN-THROUGH</i>
<i>WITH AN INVITED AUDIENCE.</i>
<i>THERE WILL BE SEVERAL</i>
<i>HUNDRED PEOPLE HERE.</i>
(Sean)
ONLY 6:30.
UH, LOOK.
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GIVE ME THE MONEY,
I MEAN,
JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.
JUST TELL ME
AND I'LL DO IT, OK?
THEN YOU CAN PAY ME
AND I'LL GET OUT OF HERE.
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
(James)
YOU EVER BEEN WITH A WOMAN
WHO THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD?
I WANT YOU TO WALK
OVER THERE LIKE A MAN.
EXPLAIN THE SITUATION.
WHAT SITUATION?
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
YOU MEAN EXPLAIN TO HER
THAT YOU'RE NOT DEAD?
THAT'S THE TICKET!
HOW COME YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT DEAD? I DON'T GET THAT!
I KNOW I'M NOT DEAD.
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
I'M NOT DEAD.
NOW GET ON OVER THERE,
TAKE THE PLUNGE.
(James)
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO DESERVE THIS?
I'VE LIVED AN HONORABLE LIFE
FOR THE MOST PART.
HAD A FEW
SLIP-UPS NOW AND THEN.
I WORKED MY ASS OFF
FOR IDIOTS,
NEVER ONCE
HAS THERE EVER BEEN
ANY QUESTION OF MY EXISTENCE,
NEVER ONCE.
IT'S HUMILIATING.
I'M TOO OLD TO BE
HAVING TO PROVE I'M ALIVE.
SEAN, YOU ALL RIGHT?
IT'S ROUGH.
NO, IT'S GOOD, MAN.
I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING.
WELL, THERE'S
A COUPLE LITTLE LINES.
IT WAS ROUGH FIRST TIME.
FROM AN AUDIENCE'S
PERSPECTIVE, IT WASN'T ROUGH.
UH, PEACEFUL, PEACE,
THAT WHOLE SECTION THERE
WAS WORKING JUST BEAUTIFULLY,
BUT I THINK IT'S EVEN STRONGER
IF YOU MAINTAIN THAT THING
THAT WOULD MAKE OUT HERE WITH
THE MOOD AND THE ATMOSPHERE.
OK, THE "SLAUGHTERED BY
COMANCHES" THING IS NOT WORKING.
THE--THE--THE JOKE
IS THE COMANCHES...
YOU'RE PROVING YOURSELF
TO BE A TEXAN
THROUGH THE FACT
THAT COMANCHES
SLAUGHTERED YOUR
GREAT-GREAT GRANDMOTHER.
COMANCHES DIDN'T
SLAUGHTER ANYBODY BUT TEXANS,
SO THAT'S THE JOKE.
SO, THEN, ON TOP OF THAT
YOU HAVE TO JUMP ON
HOW FUNNY THAT IS.
THAT'S A JOKE, OK?
LISTEN, YOU MAKE IT FUNNY,
I'LL LAUGH.
(Sam)
IT'S A JOKE!
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
LEFT TEXAS TO BEGIN WITH,
THAT'S THE WHOLE PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE!
I DON'T FIT UP HERE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU GET RAISED UP
IN A FRIENDLY PLACE,
YOU THINK THE WHOLE REST OF
THE WORLD'S JUST AS FRIENDLY.
BOY, YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.
(Sean) YOU'RE NOT FROM TEXAS,
YOU'RE FROM ALBUQUERQUE.
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM TEXAS!
(Woody)
TYLER, TEXAS, BORN AND RAISED.
MY GREAT-GREAT GRANDMOTHER
WAS SLAUGHTERED BY COMANCHES.
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
FROM TEXAS ALL RIGHT.
YOUR GREAT-GREAT GRANDMOTHER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR GREAT-GREAT GRANDMOTHER
WAS SLAUGHTERED BY COMANCHES?
THAT, UH, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A STORY TO ME.
A STORY?
A FABRICATION.
YOU'RE NOT CALLING ME
A LIAR, ARE YOU?
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY
IS A PACK OF LIARS,
THEY ARE BORN LIARS,
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.
(Sean)
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
TO GET TO
THE HEART OF THINGS.
SOMEBODY, SOMETIME
HAS GOT TO GET TO
THE HEART OF THINGS.
JALAPENO?
NO, THANK YOU.
IF YOU'RE FROM TEXAS,
YOU CAN TAKE THE HEAT.
YEAH.
<i>(T-Bone)</i> <i>DESPERATE, DESPERATE,</i>
<i>DESPERATE SITUATION, ACTING.</i>
<i>ACTING ITSELF IS DESPERATE.</i>
<i>BECAUSE ACTING IS REVEALING,</i>
<i>NO MATTER WHAT ONE SAYS.</i>
<i>YOU'RE REVEALING.</i>
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE OF THIS!
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE OF THIS!
<i>(T-Bone)</i>
<i>YOU'LL SAY, YOU MAY SAY,</i>
<i>"I'M COUCHING THIS</i>
<i>IN A CHARACTER,</i> <i>IN SOMEONE ELSE</i>
<i>AND, UH, WHY WOULD</i>
<i>SOMEONE DO THAT?"</i>
<i>I'M LOST A LOT OF TIME.</i>
<i>YOU KNOW, THIS IS A SEARCH.</i>
(Nick)
I'M NOTHING LIKE THE OLD MAN.
OH, GOD!
(Nick) ...MY LIVING,
BREATHING, CONNIVING BROTHER.
KNOCK IT OFF!
ALL RIGHT? STAND STILL,
TURN AROUND.
(Cheech)
WALK OUT OF THE DOOR.
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
FOR OVER A MONTH.
(Sean)
I'M A LITTLE LOST HERE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
(Sean) NOTHING'S THE MATTER.
NOTHING'S THE MATTER.
(Sean) IT'S JUST SO STUPID,
IT'S JUST SO STUPID.
HE DIED OUT HERE
LIKE THIS, WITH NO CONTACT,
OUT HERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
WITH NO CONTACT,
NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER.
(Sam)
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
THE WAY YOU GUYS
HIT THAT LAST NIGHT.
IT FELT SO...
THANK GOD.
IT WOULDN'T HAVE
WORKED ON FILM.
IT WAS GREAT.
THE SUBTEXT OF IT
AT THE MOMENT:
I'M SO FUNNY.
FUNNY AS FUNNY CAN BE.
(Nick) I TELL YOU, YOU READ
LIKE A NERVOUS BROTHER THAT WAS--
(Sean)
YOU GOT THAT.
HE'S ENTIRELY
OUT OF THE ACT.
(Sam)
OK, WHERE ARE WE?
IT'S ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS
YOU NEVER FORGET, YOU KNOW,
BUT IT WAS HORRIBLE BECAUSE
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SMASHED.
UM, AND I'D KNOWN-- I SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN BETTER, OVER THE YEARS
TO TRY TO SIT DOWN WITH HIM
WHEN HE WAS IN THAT STATE
BECAUSE HE WAS A, UH,
HE WAS MAD MAN,
HE WAS CRAZY, YOU KNOW,
HE WAS TOTALLY CRAZY.
AND, UH,
YOU KNOW, THIS DR. JEKYLL AND
MR. HYDE PERSONALITY THING
THAT HAPPENS WITH AL--WITH-
WITH TRUE ALCOHOLICS, YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, JUST POW! YOU KNOW.
SO I SAT DOWN, I MADE THE
MISTAKE OF SITTING DOWN WITH HIM.
AND TRYING TO, UH, JUST TO
HAVE A NORMAL CONVERSATION,
BUT HE--HE--HE
WAS RANTING
AND RAVING, YOU KNOW,
AND HE WAS CARRYING ON.
AND, UH, ONE OF HIS,
I REMEMBER
HIS--HIS MAIN THING WAS,
THAT HE WANTED ME
TO TAKE HIM WITH ME
BACK TO THIS LITTLE RANCH THAT
I HAD IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
TO WORK AS A HAND ON
THIS RANCH, YOU KNOW?
WELL, HE WAS IN
NO CONDITION TO...
YOU KNOW, HE'D BURN
THE FUCKING PLACE DOWN, YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, HE'D...
AND--AND I WAS TRYING
TO FIND A SORT OF DIPLOMATIC WAY
OF REFUSING HIM
AND EVERYTHING.
ANYWAY, ONCE HE GOT WIND OF THE
FACT THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT,
THAT I WASN'T
GOING TO DO THAT,
HE JUST WENT-- HE JUST
HAD A FIT, YOU KNOW,
AND--AND--AND
HE STARTED SCREAMING AND YELLING
AND TELLING ME TO GET OUT
OF THE PLACE, YOU KNOW.
SO I WAS BACKING OUT THE DOOR
AND I REMEMBER
THE LAST THOUGHT I HAD WAS,
DON'T RETALIATE.
WHATEVER YOU DO
IN THIS MOMENT, DON'T RETALIATE
BECAUSE YOU'LL REGRET IT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I HAD THAT THOUGHT IN MY HEAD.
BUT HE WAS-- HE WAS
JUST GONE, YOU KNOW,
FROTHING AT THE MOUTH, SCREAMING,
THROWING SHIT AT ME, YELLIN',
AND I WAS IN THIS LITTLE
SCREEN DOOR BETWEEN,
YOU KNOW, IN THOSE--
THOSE THINGS
WE WERE TALKIN' ABOUT,
THE BEER--
THE--THE BEER CURTAIN.
THE FLIP-TOP
BEER CURTAINS.
AND I WAS BETWEEN THAT
AND THOSE CURTAINS
AND, UH, AND I THOUGHT,
IF I RETALIATE IN ANY WAY, YOU KNOW,
VERBALLY
OR ANY KIND OF WAY,
UM, IT WOULD BE
A BAD DEAL.
SO I JUST KIND
OF WALKED AWAY.
AND THAT WAS THE LAST
I SAW OF HIM.
ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER,
HE WAS-- HE WAS FOUND DEAD.
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THEY PICKED HIM UP IN AN AMBULANCE
AND HE DIED
IN THE AMBULANCE.
(Sam) YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL,
JIM, IN THIS WHOLE TAIL END THING,
AFTER YOU'VE MADE THE DRIVE,
YOU'VE MADE THE TRIP
WITH NO MAP, NO DESTINATION,
AND YOU GO FOR THE BOTTLE?
YEAH.
AND YOU TURN TO HIM?
IT'S NOW MATTER OF FACT.
YOU KNOW?
YOU DON'T NEED-- I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED TO ACCUSE HIM,
I DON'T THINK YOU
NEED TO CHALLENGE HIM.
(James)
GOOD.
IT'S JUST MATTER
OF FACT, YOU KNOW.
AND ALL THE WAY BACK THROUGH
YOU WERE AFRAID OF A DEAD...
NOW--NOW HE KNOWS...
(James)
YEAH.
...SO THERE IS-- THERE IS--
THERE IS A RECONCILING, YOU KNOW.
YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED HIM.
LET NICK DEAL WITH THAT,
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
(James)
YES, I DO.
YOU'RE AFRAID OF A DEAD MAN?
(James)
RIGHT.
<i>ADIOS,</i> YOU KNOW.
IT'S GOING TO BE NICE
IF WE JUST
KEEP FILLING IT, KEEP ADDING LAYERS.
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
I LIKE THAT.
YEAH, YEAH.
BUT I THINK WHAT--WHAT
BEGINS TO HAPPEN HERE WHEN YOU--
WHEN YOU SEE HER
AND THEN ALL T-T-THIS
IMAGERY ABOUT...
"SHE SEES ME DYING,"
YOU KNOW, TH-TH-THIS THING
BECOMES IN THE PRESENT.
EVEN THOUGH IT'S MEMORY.
IT'S SOMETHING LIKE,
IT EXPLODES IN THE PRESENT.
AND YOU SEE--
YOU SEE HER SEEING YOU.
"AND THEN-- AND THEN
I WENT OUT INTO THE..."
AND ALL THAT IMAGERY
BECOMES IN THE NOW.
(James)
I RAN TO THE CAR, I DROVE.
I DROVE WITH
THE WINDOWS WIDE OPEN FOR DAYS.
THE WIND BEATING
ACROSS MY EYES, MY FACE.
I COULDN'T FEEL
MY FACE ANYMORE.
I COULDN'T STOP.
I HAVE NO MAP,
NO DESTINATION.
I JUST DROVE.
HE WAS KILLED ON
THE HIGHWAY IN--IN BERNALILLO
BECAUSE HE WAS DRUNK AND
STAGGERED OUT INTO THE HIGHWAY
AND GOT HIT BY A CAR.
BUT HE HAD GONE OFF AND DONE ALL
THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE PLAY,
GOT A HAIRCUT,
HE GOT THAT CHECK,
HE, UH, PICKED UP THAT WOMAN,
TOOK A TAXICAB AND WENT FISHING.
BLESS HIS HEART, YOU KNOW.
SO, YEAH.
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF...
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT
JUST CAN'T BE HELPED, YOU KNOW.
YOU CAN'T-- THERE'S NO POINT
IN REGRETTING.
I ACTUALLY DON'T
HAVE ANY REGRETS.
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
IT WENT DOWN, YOU KNOW.
(Sean)
IS IT A DEAD MAN?
(Sam)
YEAH, IT IS A DEAD MAN.
WOW.
(Sheila)
THIS IS GREAT, SEAN.
COOL.
(Sam)
CERTIFICATE OF DEATH.
WELL, WE FINALLY
CLEARED THAT UP.
OK, NOW WHAT?
HANG AROUND AND GET NERVOUS.
(Sheila)
JUST ANOTHER SHOW, SAM.
JUST ANOTHER HORSE RACE.
RIGHT.
15 MINUTES?
15 MINUTES, PLEASE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.
EVERYTHING'S IN GOOD SHAPE.
(James)
YEAH.
TAKE CARE OF YOUR
VOICE OUT THERE.
OK.
EVERYTHING--
EVERYTHING'S THERE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.
MOMENT BY MOMENT.
ALL RIGHT.
OK?
YEAH.
ACT ll.
YEAH.
WHEN I COME OFF THE STAGE,
THEY KNOW WHEN TO DROP THE LIGHTS?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
TIME OUT
THE RE-ENTRANCE ON THE LINE.
ACT ll, I'M TALKING ABOUT.
"SO THAT'S ALL". REMEMBER?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
OK.
I CAN'T JUST BE
HANGIN' AROUND.
I CAN'T BE JUST
HANGIN' AROUND HERE, MR. MOSS.
THERE'S OTHER
CUSTOMERS WAITING.
SO JUST FROM YOUR
CASUAL OBSERVATION,
YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE SPARK INSIDE THERE, HUH?
A LITTLE EMBER OF HOPE?
YOU LOOK ALIVE TO ME.
I DON'T KNOW.
RELAX, HAVE A GOOD SHOW,
HAVE FUN.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, SURE.
IT'S ONE OF YOUR BEST, IT IS.
I'M NOT KIDDIN' YOU.
WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN,
SAM, THANKS.
SO IS THAT BELT OK?
YEAH.
<i>BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE BEGINS,</i>
<i>PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT</i>
<i>TO TURN OFF ALL</i>
<i>CELL PHONES AND PAGERS.</i>
<i>PLEASE NOTE THAT
THE USE OF CAMERAS
<i>AND ANY OTHER RECODING DEVICE
<i>IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.</i>
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

"NO SINGING, NO DANCING.

3 BLUE-HAIRED LADIES.
