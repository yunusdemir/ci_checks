The weather looks good
for Santa Claus tonight
with a full moon and a starry sky
to help him find his way.
The temperature right now
here in Bartlesville--
21 degrees. Ooh.

Mom, what time is it?
It's almost 4:30, honey.
We're going to be
at Grandpa's pretty soon.
- Mom?
- Yes, Billy.
What time does Santa Claus come?
Not until everyone
is asleep in bed, hon.
Can't I stay up and see him?
I wouldn't if I were you.
It's naughty to stay up
past your bedtime.
Santa Claus doesn't bring presents
to naughty children.
What if we don't get home
by my bedtime?
We will, hon.
Don't worry.
Santa Claus is going to bring you
a big surprise tonight.
You just wait and see.
Man on radio:
That was always one of my favorites.
Give us a call at KSCZ for something
special we haven't played for you yet.
I've had your father brought
to the recreation room.
Right this way.
Dad.
Can you hear me?
It's me, Dad, Jimmy.
Dad, it's Ellie.
We have Billy here
and little Ricky, too.
Why doesn't Grandpa say something?
He doesn't hear us, honey.
He doesn't even know we're here.
Then what did we come for?
Billy, Shh.
He's gotten so much worse.
I have your father's records,
Mr. Chapman.
We can review them in my office.
Wait right here, okay, honey?
Daddy and I are going to be right back.
Don't worry.
Grandpa's not going to hurt you.
Grandpa?
- Mom.
- Shh.
Quiet.
What do you want her for?
She can't help you.
Nobody can.
You're scared, ain't you?
You should be.
Christmas Eve
is the scariest damn night
of the year.
I'd be scared, too,
if I was you.
You know what happens
on Christmas Eve, don't you?
You know all about Santa Claus?
He brings presents
to all good boys and girls.
Well, I'll tell you something--
Santa Claus only brings presents
to them that's been good all year.
To the ones that
ain't done nothing naughty.
Naughty.
All the other ones,
all the naughty ones,
he punishes.
What about you, boy?
You been good all year?
If you see Santa Claus tonight,
you better run, boy.
You better run for your life!
- Time to go home, Billy.
Dad, we have to go now.
We'll come back and see you soon.
Come on, son.
I'll be good from now on,
I promise.
Mommy, were you ever naughty
when you were little?
Hmm, once or twice.
Did Santa Claus ever punish you?
Where did you get
an idea like that, hon?
Grandpa.
Grandpa?
Grandpa said Santa Claus
was going to punish me.
Do you think Dad
could have talked to him?
I don't see why Billy would lie.
Maybe we ought to call Dr. Conway.
I don't want him to come.
I'm scared.
- Of who, honey?
- Santa Claus.
Honey, there's nothing to be scared of.
Grandpa said Santa Claus
was going to punish me.
Billy, calm down.
Grandpa is nothing
but a crazy old fool.
Mommy, you shouldn't have said that.
It's naughty to say bad things
about old people.
Santa Claus will punish you.
Ho, ho, ho.
I don't get enough
of this shit on the radio.
It has to come into my store now.
What's the matter,
you don't like Santa Claus?
It's good for business,
bad for my stomach.
A lot of phony sentiment,
you know what I'm saying?
What charity are you with?
What the hell
are you doing that for?
I'm holding you up, asshole.
- Put the money in the bag.
- All right, all right.
So it's not all phony sentiment, is it?
A lot of it's genuine greed.
- All right, you!
31 bucks.
Merry fucking Christmas.
Man on radio:
Steve Carlson here at KLOX FM

this Christmas Eve
is still holding in there
at 21 degrees at 7:00.

is dressed warm tonight, don't we?

Got a ways to go yet.
What's that?

I thought I saw something
out there on the road.
There it is again. See?
Jim:
There's something up there, all right.
Ellie: What would anybody be doing
stopped out here in the middle of the--
- Do you see what I see?
- He must be on his way to a party.
Do you think we should wake up Billy?
Santa Claus!
Jim: Looks like you get to see him
tonight after all, Billy.
No, Daddy,
I don't want to see him!
Keep going! Don't stop!
- Need a ride, Santa Claus?
- Well, no, not exactly.
- What's the problem?
- Oh, there's no problem.
It's just that I ran into
a little bit of lousy luck.
Ellie: Oh.
Jim, go!
- Go!
Oh, no!
Never hit me!

All right, now, who's next?
Oh, yes. We haven't seen
your drawing yet, have we?
Billy?
Billy, answer me.
Okay.
Let's go, Billy.
Come on up here.
Put your drawing
up on the board with the others.
You put it in place
and I'll put the tape on it.
Sister, look.
Billy, take that down!
Young man,
you go find Mother Superior
and you show her
what you've done. March.
Explain this, William.
I'm sorry, Mother Superior.
Are you?
I don't think so.
But you will be.
You will learn what it is to be sorry.
- Now go to your room and stay there.
- Yes, Mother Superior.
Until I tell you to come out.
Well, you finally have what you've been
asking for, Mother Superior.
- Proof.
- Of what, Sister Margaret?
What I've been saying.
That it's all still inside him.
All that terrible violence he saw.
His drawing clearly shows that.
I am not interested in what you think.
I thought you finally understood that.
Simply because something unfortunate
happened to his parents,
which he knows nothing about,
is no reason to allow him to run wild.
He must be taught.
But the memory is still there,
Mother Superior,
waiting to come out.
And if it does, and if he has
received proper training,
he will know how to cope with it.
But if he keeps going on
like this much longer,
it may be too late.
It seems to get worse for him
every Christmas.
Well,
it won't go on any longer.
I will take charge
of that child personally.
He needs help,
Mother Superior.
He'll get it.
Good day, Sister.
Good day, Mother Superior.
I think you've been locked away
up here long enough.
Why don't you come out
and help us build our snowman?
I can't.
Look, Billy,
Mother Superior only wants
what's best for you.
And I think what's best for you
is to come out and play
with the other children, okay?
- Hmm?
- Yes, Sister.
Okay.
You filthy devil!
You'll pay for this.
Punishment.
You little devil,
take your punishment.
- Devil!
- Woman: Sorry! Please, stop!
Mother Superior:
Take it! Take it!
William!
Don't blame him, Mother Superior.
I told him he could--
Stay out of this,
Sister Margaret.
William, come here.
Billy, what's wrong?
Your brother's a nutcase,
that's what's wrong.
No, he's not!
Take it back!
Boys.
What did you see upstairs, William?
Nothing, Mother Superior.
Do you know what they were doing?
No, Mother Superior.
Good.
What they were doing
was something very, very naughty.
They thought they could do it
without being caught.
But when we do something naughty,
we are always caught.
And then we are punished.
Punishment is absolute.
Punishment is necessary.
- Punishment is good.
- Yes, Mother Superior.
- You left your room, William.
- Yes, Mother Superior.
Very, very naughty.
Now go to bed and stay there.
Please, let me up.
Sister Margaret.
- Let me up!
- Leave him alone.
Please, let me up.
Please, let me up.
Let me up, Sister Margaret.
Let me out of here!
Let me out.
Let me out.
Please, let me out.
Sister Margaret.
Let me out of here!
Please!
Ow.
Please, let me up,
Sister Margaret.
I see nothing but greed
when there should be gratitude.
What is it?
Can I see it?
Are you ready
to behave properly, William?
Yes, Mother Superior.
Good.
Go find your present.
You will have
no more trouble with him.
You will see how well
my methods work.
Of course he'll improve
once Christmas is over.
He always does.
Well, it isn't over,
Sister Margaret.
We still have our annual
Christmas visit from Santa Claus.
William will sit on Santa Claus' lap
and behave.
You'll see.
No! No! No!
- No!
- Get him out of the way.
- No!
- You will learn gratitude.
- Say thank you to Santa Claus.
- No! No!
Billy!
What the hell's wrong with that kid?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be naughty.
Don't punish me.
Please.
Woman: William.
Sister Margaret:
Please, Mr. Sims,
every store in town has turned us down.
There must be some job
that you can give this boy.
- Why, he just turned--
- I'm sorry, Sister,
but I only have one job open
and it's for a man,
not for a boy.
It's in the stock room hauling crates.
It's just not a job for a kid.
I suppose not.
Sorry I couldn't help.
Well, you wouldn't expect some kid
to haul heavy crates all day long,
would you?
Glad you understand.
Oh, here's Billy now.
Maybe you'd like to meet him, Mr. Sims.
- That's not necessary.
- Billy.
Billy, meet Mr. Sims.
Oh.
Well, uh, um...
I'm always happy to help
the church, Sister.
He starts Monday morning.
9:00 sharp.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sims.

I'm-- you know,
you shouldn't talk like that.
Oh, well, excuse me,
Ann Landers.
You know, what is it
with you lately, Billy?
Nothing.
I'm going to level with you.
When you came here
a couple of months ago,
you were an all right kid.
But all of a sudden,
you got this fucking attitude problem.
Snapping at me all the time.
You're staring off into space
like some moon goon.
Will you just-- just leave me alone,
all right?
When I leave you alone, asshole,
none of your fucking work gets done.
Look, I don't care
about my fucking work.
Oh, is that so, wise ass?
Look, just leave me alone.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho.
Come here,
you little bastard.
- Pamela.
- Are you all right, Billy?
Yeah.
Yeah, I--
You don't look so good.
No, I'm fine.
Really, I--
Don't worry about this stuff.
I'll straighten it up for you, okay?
- Are you sure you're all right, Billy?
Yeah, yeah.
I never felt better in my life.
Billy, are you sure you're all right?
Never felt better in my life.
No! Don't!
No!
I want to be good.
I didn't mean to be naughty.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't punish me.
Don't punish me.
( young Billy's voice )
Please.
Christmas Eve.
Only one more day
and this Christmas crap is history.
I hate to ruin your party mood,
Mr. Sims,
but a teensy problem
has arisen personnel wise.
Well, do something
about it solution wise.
It ain't that simple, Mr. Sims.
I just got a call
from one of the employees.
Seems he went ice-skating last night
and broke his ankle.
He'll be out for the remainder
of the season.
Lucky him.
Call the temporary agency
and get a replacement.
Do I have to think
of everything around here?
Well, then think of this.
The agency's only got women.
This job requires a person
of the male persuasion.
- Oh.
- A big, fat, jolly one.
- You're receiving me?
- Oh, no.
Ho, ho, ho.
You pull another disappearing act
like yesterday, Billy,
and I'm going to go straight to Sims.
I don't think you realize this,
but I'm giving you a break.
That's a hell of a lot more
than he'll do.
Sims is nobody's friend.
Remember that.
- Ah, Mr. Sims.
- Billy boy.
How are you?
I've been meaning to come around
and see how you're enjoying yourself.
Well, everything okay?
Uh, yeah. Yes. Fine.
Everything's fine, Mr. Sims.
Good, good. Good boy.
Ah, listen, Bill.
The reason I dropped by,
I've got a little problem
maybe you could help me with.
I mean, if you'd like to.
Well, of course, Mr. Sims.
Anything you want. You just tell me
what it is and I'll be glad to help out.
Good. Good boy.
Thank you.
That's very good.
Very realistic.
Isn't it, Mrs. Randall?
He's definitely fat and jolly.
Take a closer look at yourself
in the mirror, Billy.
Now just remember,
be jolly.
Lots of ho, ho, ho.
Try not to scare the little bastards.
Sometimes they cry their heads off.
I guess they think the old guy's scary.
Silly, isn't it?
Yeah.
Silly.
- Stop it.
Please, stop it.
What's the matter with you?
Please, stop it.
Please, stop it.
What's the matter with you?
Stop it. Stop kicking.
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?
You're being naughty.
Right on Santa's lap.
I don't bring toys to naughty children.
I punish them.
Severely.
That's right. Stop it.
Or I'll have to punish you.
He sure knows how to handle kids.
He's great, isn't he?
Mommy!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Christ, keep your head on.
Stock room. Andy speaking.
Who?
No, no.
Billy don't work back here no more.
Sure, sure.
I can tell you his new job.
Ho, ho, ho.
He's playing Santa Claus
for a bunch of snot-nosed kids.
7:00. It's over!

He'd send us back out to pick up

Be quiet for a minute.

watching me.
Like who?
Santa's little elves?
Well, maybe it was
just my imagination.
Yeah, it would be
if you had one.
Now ride your stupid sled.
My sled ain't stupid.
I'll show you. Watch.
Well, if it isn't Bob and Mac.
Now why don't you guys
just get the fuck out of the way?
Glad to, little man.
But, uh,
we're going to go sledding.

- Yeah.
You guys are
going to take our sleds.
Oh, you guys are great.

Any news?
All bad, Sister.
Three more murders.
Been eluding my men all night.
Kid may be nuts,
but he's not stupid.
No, he's not stupid.
In fact, everything he's been doing
has a kind of logic to it,
once you've understood
what he's gone through.
If that's true,
there ought to be a way
we can predict his next move.
Oh, my Lord.
I want those papers
folded and stacked.
Not tossed about.
And I want each one of you
to write a nice thank-you to Santa
for his visit later.
Are you listening?
Better say good-bye now. Mother Superior
wants us to write a note to Santa Claus.
Is that the only line out there, Sister?
- I'm afraid so.
- Still busy.
I can't imagine who'd be
on the phone so long.
We can't wait any longer.
I'm going down to the dispatcher
and you and I are going out
to the orphanage together.
Sister.
Captain Richards on radio:
I need every available car
to go out to the orphanage
on the double.
The Santa Claus Killer
may be headed that way there now.
Responding officers are ordered
to shoot to kill if necessary.
If you get wet or start to feel cold,
come back inside.
Wow.
Cut it out!
Can't you see who's coming?
This is Officer Barnes.
I'm approaching the orphanage now.
Everything looks okay.
There's a bunch of kids
playing in the yard.
Holy shit.
Hey! Hold it!
Get out-- get away from him!
Oh, my God.
Children, inside. Hurry.
- Santa!
- What happened?!
Ricky!
Come away from there.

I'm sorry, Sister.
But at least it's all over.
Captain, we got a problem here.
The description of the dead man,
it's all wrong.
What do you mean all wrong?
Barnes says the guy's about 50,
under six feet tall.
My God.
It's Father O'Brien.
He was our Santa this year.
Kid we're looking for is 18.
Barnes wanted the guy to stop, Captain.
He didn't respond.
But of course not, he's deaf.
He couldn't hear it.
You tell Barnes
to stay at the orphanage.
The killer may still be
on his way there.
10-4.
We've got to help him.
We've just got to.
I don't understand how you could have
mistaken Father O'Brien
for the murderer in the first place.
He was dressed as a Santa Claus.
Captain Richards can explain everything
when he gets here, ma'am.
I'm sorry for what happened,
but there is a killer on the way here.
Oh, the children.
No harm must come to the children.
Do you understand?
That's why I'm here, Sister.
I am Mother Superior.
And so far,
all you have done is harm.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to check out the grounds.
In the meantime, you make sure
everyone stays locked up inside.
Don't let anybody come in
unless you know exactly who it is.
No one is going to get in
that doesn't belong here.
Poor things are scared to death.
Hmm? Oh, yes.
They need something
to keep their mind off it.
Richard.
Yes, Mother Superior.
Will you please get my pitch pipe?
Thank you.
Such a good boy.
Not at all like
his older brother William.
Children, listen to me.
I know that you're very upset
and I understand,
but I want you to stop that moping.
We're going to sing.
Thank you.
- Ooh.
Ready, Sister?

All right. Andrew,
where do you think you're going?
Come on.
We need altos.
No, don't!
Girl:
It's Santa.
Chrissie, stay away.
Stay away from him.
But, Mother Superior,
it's Santa Claus.
Chrissie,
stay away from him.
Hello, Santa.
Chrissie, come here.
Come here.
Andrew, come here.
There's no Santa Claus.
There is no Santa Claus.
Naughty.

Billy:

You're safe now.
Santa Claus is gone.
