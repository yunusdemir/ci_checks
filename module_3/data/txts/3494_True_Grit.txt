*"Leaning on the everlasting arms"
playing softly*
People did not give it credence that
a young girl could leave home.
And go off in the winter time
to avenge her father's blood.
But it did happen.
I was just fourteen years of age when a coward
by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down.
And robbed him of his life, and his horse.
And two California gold pieces that he carried
in his trouser pant.
Chaney was a hired man.
And Papa had taken him up to fort Smith
to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd brought.
In town, Chaney had followed to drink.
And cards, and lost all his money.
He got it into his head he was being cheated.
And went back to the boarding house
for his Henry Rifle.
When Papa tried to intervene.
Chaney shot him.
Chaney fled.
He could have walked his horse.
For not a soul in that city could
be bothered to give chase.
No doubt Chaney fancied himself, scott free.
But he was wrong.
You must pay for everything in this world,
one way or another.
There is nothing free.
Except the grace of God.
Is that the man?
That is my father.
If you would like to kiss him,
It would be all right.
He's gone to heaven.
Praise the Lord.
Why is it so much?
The quality of the casket.
And of the embaming.
The life like appearance requires time and art.
And the chemicals go dear,
particulars are nubbin.
If you'd like to kiss him, It would be all right.
Thank you, the spirit does flow.
Your wire said fifty dollars.
You did not specify that
he was to be shipped.
Well sixty dollars is every cent we have.
That leaves nothing for our board.
Yarnell you proceed for the body to be
transport at the train station, and complete home.
I'll sleep here tonight.
I want to collect father's receipts
and see to other business.
Your mama didn't say nothing about you
settling no business here.
It's business mama didn't know about. It's all right
Yarnell, I dismiss you.
I am not sure.
Tell mama not to sign anything until I return home
and see that Papa is buried in his Mason's apron.
Your terms are agreeable, if I might
pass the night here.
Here, among these people?
-These people?
-I'm expecting three more souls.
Sutherland, Smith, and His-tongue-in-the-rain.
Take it easy gentlemen, you were aware.
And train up your children the way
that they should go.
You see what has become of me.
Because of drink.
I killed a man.
In a triffiling quarrel over a pocket knife.
If I had received this instruction as a child...
Could you point out the sheriff?
Him with the moustaches.
I would be with my wife and children today.
I do not know what is to become of them.
But I hope and pray that she will not slight
them and compel them to go into low company.
Well.
I killed the wrong man, as the which why I'm here.
Had I killed the man I meant to. I don't
believed I'd a been convicted.
I see men out there in that crowd,
that's worse than me.
Okay.
Before I hang, I would like to say.
(Chanting in Indian tongue)
Naw, we ain't arrested him.
They caught up to him, but he lit
out to the territory.
I would think that he throwed in to
Lucky Ned Pepper, who's gang robbed him.
Mail house yesterday at the Rotel river.
Well, why are you not looking for him?
I ain't no authority in the Indian Nation.
Tom Chaney is the business of the U.S Marshall’s now.
When will they arrest him?
Not soon, I'm afraid, the Marshall’s are not well staffed.
And  I'll tell you, frankly, Chaney is at the
end of a long list of fugitives and malefactors.
Could I hire a Marshall to pursue Tom Chaney?
You have a lot of experience with
bounty hunters, do you?
That is a silly question. I am here
to settle my father's affairs.
-All alone.
-I am the person for it.
Mama was never any good at sums.
And she could hardly spell 'cat'.
I intend to see Papa's killer hang.
Well, nothing prevents you from offering a
reward and so informing the Marshall’s.
I'd pay real  money though,
to be persuasive.
Chaney's across the river, in Choctaw nation.
I will see to the money.
Who's the best Marshall?
I'd have to weigh that.
William Waters, is the best tracker.
He's half Comanche, and it is something
to see him cut the sun.
The meanest, is Rooster Cogburn.
He is a pitiless man. Double tough.
Fear don't enter into his thinking.
Hmm, lots of pulled cork.
The best is probably, L.T. Quinn.
He brings his prisoners in alive.
Now he may let one slip out.
Now and again, but he believes that even the
worst of men, is entitled to a fair share.
Where can I find this, Rooster?
The place is occupied.
I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.
I have prior business.
You've been at it for quite some time,
Mr. Cogburn.
There is no call for my business.
The hell with you. How did you spot me here?
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon.
The saloon had afford me here, we must talk.
Women aren't allowed in the saloon.
I was not there as a customer.
I am fourteen years old.
The place is occupied.
Will be for some time.
Good evening.
If you would like to sleep in a coffin,
I would be honored.
How much are you paying for cotton?
Nine and a half, for low and middlin'
and ten for ordinary.
Think I'm surprise of that, really.
I sold to the Wizten brothers in
Little Rock for eleven cents.
Then I suggest you take the balance of it
to the Witzen brothers.
I take the balance to Witzen.
At ten and a half.
Why'd you come here to tell me this?
I thought I might shop around a
place. I'm doing alright in Little Rock.
I'm Mattie Ross.
Daughter of Frank Ross.
Aw, tragic thing.
May I say, your father impressed me.
With his manly qualities. He was a close trader,
but he acted a gentleman.
My post was to sell those ponies back to
you, that  my father brought.
Well that I fear, is out of the question.
Well, we'll see that they are shipped to
you, at my earliest convenience.
We don't want the ponies now, we don't need them.
Well that hardly concerns me. Your
father brought the ponies, and paid for them.
And there's an end to it. I have the bill of sale.
And I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse that
was stolen from your stable.
You'll have to take that up with the
man who stole the horse.
Tom Chaney stole the horse
while it was in your care.
You were responsible.
Yeah, I admire your sin.
But I believe you'll find I'm not
liable for such claims.
You were the custodian.
If you were a bank that were robbed. You could not
simply tell your depositors to go hang.
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is vexing enough.
Secondly your evaluation of the horse is high.
By about two hundred dollars.
How old are you?
If anything, my purse is low.
My Judy was a fine racing mare.
I've seen her jump a eight rung fence
with a rider at four eighteen.
Oh, it's all very interesting.
The ponies are yours, take them.
Your father horse was stolen by a murderous criminal.
I have provided reasonable protection for the creature
as per our implicit agreement.
My watchmen had his teeth knocked out,
you can take on his suit.
That would take to long.
You have no case.
Courage would make the dartmore to long.
This is by a jury.
Petitioned by a widow and three small children.
I will pay two hundred dollars to your fathers estate.
When I have in my hand a letter from your lawyer,
absolving me of all liability from the beginning
of the world to today.
I'll take two hundred dollars for Judy,
plus one hundred for the ponies.
And twenty five dollars for the grey horse
that Tom Chaney left.
He was easily worth, forty.
That is three hundred and twenty five dollars, sold.
The ponies have no part in it.
I will not buy them.
And the price for Judy is three hundred
and twenty five dollars.
I would not pay three hundred and twenty
five dollars for winged Pegasus.
As for the grey horse,
it does not belong to you.
The grey horse was lent to Tom Chaney
by my father.
Chaney only had the use of him.
I would pay two hundred and twenty five dollars.
And keep the grey horse.
And I want the ponies.
Then it's settled, then.
There will be no settlement after I leave this
office and go to the court of law.
All right, this is my last offer.
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
For that I get the release, previously discussed.
And I keep your father's saddle.
The grey horse is not yours to sell.
The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it.
Glory Daniel will approve of the grey horse.
He will come after you with a great vengeance.
What? All right, now look,
listen very carefully.
As I will not bargain further.
I'll will take the ponies back, and the
grey horse. Which is mine.
And settle...
For three hundred dollars. Now you must
take that or leave it.
And I do not much care which it is.
My Lawyer Decker would not wish me to consider
anything under three hundred and twenty five dollars.
But I will settle for three hundred and twenty.
If I am given twenty in advance.
Now here's what I have to say
about that saddle.
Frank Post's store.
Oh, poor child.
Now you are staying with us, or
you hurry back home to your momma.
I'll stay here, if you can have me.
I just had my stay at the undertakers.
In the company of three corpses.
I felt like Ezekiel.
In valley of the dry bones.
Then, God bless you.
Now that you'll be rooming with,
Grandma Turner.
But that is all that we got, with all the people
in town come to see the hanging.
This was in your poor father's room.
That is everything.
There are no light fingers in this house.
If you need something for to
tote the gun around?
I can give you an empty flour sack for a nickel.
Well what did you see when you arrived?
A woman, was out in the yard.
Dead with blow flies on her face.
An old man was inside with his breast
opened by a scatter gun. His feet burned.
He was still alive, but just. Said those
two Wharton boys had done it.
-Rode up, drunk.
-Objection.
Hearsay.
My declaration, your honor.
Objection's overruled.
Proceed Mr. Cogburn.
Now them two Wharton boys, Otis
and C.C. rode down on him.
Asked him where his money was,
but he wouldn't tell them.
They lit pine nut items to his feet.
He told them the money was in the fruit jar.
Under a grey rock at the corner of the smoke house.
And then?
Well I got on, after one considerable fact.
What'd you do then?
I and Marshall Potter and
went out to the smoke house.
And that rock had been moved, the
jar with the money in it was gone.
-Objection, speculative.
-Sustained.
You found a flat grey rock, in the corner of the smoke house.
With a hollowed out space there.
If the prosecutor is going to give evidence,
I suggest he be sworn.
Mr. Cogburn. What did you find, if anything,
in the corner of that smokehouse?
Halved-out grey rock with a hollowed
out space under it, nothing there.
-Well what did you?
-No jar or nothing.
Well, rode up to the Wharton boys area,
there with a north fork tracker The Canadian.
What did you find?
The Canadian.
I had my glass, spotted them two boys
and their old daddy Aaron.
Went down the quick bank with some hogs.
They killed a shoat.
And a fire built up under a wash pot
for scalding water.
What'dja do?
Announced we was U.S. Marshall’s, I hollered
out to Aaron.
I needed to talk to his two boys.
He raised an axe.
Raised to cussing us and blathering this court.
What did he do then?
I backed away from the axe.
Tried to talked some sense into him.
While this was going on C.C. he edges over
to the wash pot there, behind the steam.
Picks up a shot gun.
Potter seen him, but it was to late.
C.C. went and pulled out on
Potter with one barrel.
Turned to do the same for me and I shot him.
And the old man raised the axe.
And I shot him.
Otis lit out, and I shot him.
Bizzy working there when he hit the ground,
Otis was just gone.
Did you find the jar with a
hundred and twenty dollars in it?
-Leading.
-Sustained.
What happened then?
Found a jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it.
What became of Otis Wood?
There he sits.
You may ask, Mr. Gaudy.
Thank you Mr. Farlow.
Mr. Cogburn.
In your four years as a U.S. Marshall.
How many men have you shot?
Never shot nobody that didn't ask for it.
Well that was not the question.
How many?
Shot or killed?
Let us restrict it to killed, so that
we may have a manageable figure.
About twelve.
Fifteen stopped them in flight,
defended myself, etcetera.
Around twelve he says.
Or fifteen.
So many, you cannot keep
a precise count.
I have examined the records, and can
supply the accurate figure.
Uhh...
I believe them two Wharton boys
makes it twenty three.
And how many members of this one family,
the Wharton family, have you killed?
-Inebriated or..
-Didn't you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother?
And Clete Wharton, half brother.
Well Clete was selling northern spirits to the Cherokee.
He come at me with a king bolt
A King bolt?
You are armed, and he advanced upon you.
With nothing more than a king bolt?
From a wagon turn?
I've seen men retort with nothing
more than a king bolt. I defended myself.
Returning to the other encounter.
With Aaron Wharton, and his two remaining sons.
You sprang from cover.
With revolver in hand.
-That'd be it.
-Loaded and cocked.
Well if it ain't loaded
and cocked, it don't shoot.
And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced
against an armed man.
Well he was armed, he had an axed raised.
I believe you testified you backed away
from Aaron Wharton.
-That's right.
-Which direction were you going?
I always go backwards,
when I'm backing up.
Very amusing.
Yeah, he advanced on you much
in the manner of Clete Wharton.
Menacing you with that little ol' King bolt,
or mince packer, or whatever that was.
Said he surely commit to cussin'.
-Laid about a threat.
-And you were backing away.
How many steps before the shooting started?
Uh, seven to eight steps.
Good, and Wharton keeping pace.
Advancing away from his campfire.
Seven, eight, steps.
What would that be?
Fifteen, twenty take?
I suppose.
Will you explain to this jury, Mr. Cogburn.
Why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by his
wash pot, one arm in the fire.
His sleeve and hand smoldering.
Did you move the body after you shot him?
Why would I do that?
You did not drag the body over to
the fire and throw his arm in.
-No, sir.
-Two witnesses.
Who arrived on the scene will testify
to the location of the body.
You do not remember moving the body.
So it was, a cold blooded bushwhack,
while poor Mr. Wharton was tending his campfire.
Objection.
If that's where the body was,
I might have moved him.
I do not remember.
Why, would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?
Them hogs were moving around,
they might have moved him.
I'd do not remember.
... son of a bitch.
-Mr. Cogburn.
-What do you want?
I'd like to talk to you a minute.
What is it?
They tell me you're a man with, True Grit.
What do you want, girl?
Speak up, tucker down.
Let me do that.
Your makings are due dry.
I'm looking for the man who shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross in front of the Monarch boarding house.
The man's name is Tom Chaney.
They say he's over in Indian territory,
and I need someone to go after him.
What's your name, girl.
My name is Mattie Ross.
We're located in Yell county.
My mother is at home looking after my
sister Victoria and my brother little Frank.
You best go home to them.
They'll need help with the charges.
There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney.
Government will pay you two dollars to
bringing him in plus two cents a mile for expenses.
On top of that, I will pay you
a fifty dollar reward.
What are you?
What you got there in your poke?
My god, poke for a gun.
You're no bigger than a corn muffin.
What are you doing with a pistol like that?
Well I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.
-Kill Tom Chaney?
-Well the law prefers to do so.
Well that piece will do the job for you.
If you find a house Dep to arrest him for you,
and the world is behind you.
Nobody here knew my father and I'm,
afraid nothing's going to be done about
Chaney except I do it.
My brother is a child, and my mother is
indecisive and hobbled by grief.
I don't believe you fifty dollars.
I will contract Lieutenant Stone, who will
wish to make payment tomorrow, or the next day.
Once our lawyer countersigns.
Don't believe in fairy tales sermons or stories about
muddy babies. Accepting but thanks for the cigarette.
Isn't your Mama expecting you home, dear?
My business is not yet finished.
Mrs. Flor, have any rooms opened up?
Grandma Turners. The bed is quite narrow.
The second floor in the back did open up.
But uh, that gentleman on the porch,
has just taken it.
Oh but don't worry yourself, dear.
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.
My name is La Boeuf.
I just come from Yell county.
We have no ruffian friends in Yell county.
The all get you ....
I saw your mother yesterday morning.
She said for you to come right on home.
What was your business there?
This is a man I think you know.
You called him Tom Chaney.
I believe. All the months I've been tracking
him he has used the name, Theron Chelmsford.
John Todd Anderson,
and others.
He dailed in Monroe Louisiana, and
Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
Before turning up at your fathers place.
Then why did you not catch him at,
Pine Bluff Arkansas or Monroe Louisiana?
He is a crafty one.
I thought him slow witted myself.
That was his act.
It was a good one.
Are you some kind of law?
That's right
I'm a Texas Ranger.
Don't that make you a big noise
in that state.
In Arkansas you should know
you Texas Rangers trappings and title
do not make him more addictive to fame.
Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney?
He shot and killed a state senator
named Bibs in Waco Texas.
Bib's finally put out a reward.
And who say's Chaney killed this senator.
I understand there was an argument about a dog.
You know anything about the
whereabouts of Chaney?
Well he's in the territory, and I hold out
little hope for winning your bounty.
-Why is that?
-I'm going to beat you to him.
I've hired a deputy Marshall.
The toughest one they have.
And he's familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang
they say Chaney's tied up with.
Well, I will throw in with you
and your Marshall.
No, Marshall Cogburn and I are fine.
It'll be to our mutual advantage.
Your Marshall, I presume, knows the territory.
I know Chaney. It's at least a two man
job to take him in alive.
When Chaney is taken he's going to
Fort Smith to be hanged.
I'm not having him go to Texas to
hang for shooting a Senator.
It is not important where he hangs, it is?
It is to me.
Is it to you?
It means a great deal of money to me,
and many month's work.
Oh I'm sorry that you won't be
at peace working for your wages.
And that you'd be willing to go
after a half-wit.
You give out very little shivle
with your pronouncements.
When I sat there watching, I gave some
thought to stealing a kiss.
But you are very young and sick, and
unattractive to boot, but
now I have a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.
That wouldn't be as unpleasant as the other.
You wet your comb, you might tame that cowlick.
(Lawyers voice)
Madame, I wish you would leave these matters
entirely to me or at the very least
give me the courtesy of consulting me before
entering such agreements.
I am not scolding you, but I am saying your
head strong ways,
will lead you into a tight corner one day.
I trust the enclosed document
will let you conclude your business and
return to Yell County.
Yours, J. Mulden Daggett.
I was just as bad yesterday as
you look today.
Of course you don't have
to bed with Grandma Turner.
I'm not acquainted with Grandma Turner.
She's a resident of the city, it does not
surprise me that she carry's disease.
This malaria's place has ruined my health.
As it has my finances.
I owe you money.
You were not treated poorly.
Oh, certainly not.
I'm paying you for a horse.
I do not possess.
And I brought back a string of useless ponies.
Which I cannot sell again.
You're forgetting the Grey horse.
-Right.
-You were looking at the thing in the wrong light.
I am looking at it in the light
of Gods eternal truth.
Your illness is putting you down,
in the dumps.
You will soon find another buyer for the ponies.
Well I have a tentative offer
for ten dollars per head.
For the fixer soap works at Little Rock
That would be a shame to discourage
the spirited horse flesh.
So it would. I'm confident the deal
will fall through.
Look here, I need a pony and I will
pay ten dollars for one of them.
Now that's a light price, no, no, I.
Wait a minute.
Are we trading again?
This one is beautiful.
He don't know he got a rider.
You're to light.
Keep your key on the horse line.
He's very spirited.
I'll call him 'Little Blackie'.
That's a good name.
What does he like for a treat?
Well ma'am, he's a horse.
So he likes apples.
Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.
No ma'am, I ain't suppose to utter your name.
See, sleep.
That is fine, I will wake him.
Marshall Cogburn.
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.
How long 'till your ready to go?
-Go where?
-To the Indian Territory to pursue Tom Chaney.
Oh, you're the grieved girl with
the stories of El Dorado.
Huh, how much money you got there?
I would say fifty dollars to pursue Chaney,
you did not believe me.
I did not know.
You are one to figure.
How long for you to make
ready to depart?
Well uh, hold on sis.
I remember your offer, I
do not remember agreeing to it.
If I'm to go up against, Ned Pepper.
Then I'll need a hundred dollars.
That much I can tell you. A hundred dollars.
To take your man, a hundred dollars.
Will take a fifty dollar advance for.
expenses.
You are trying to take advantage of me.
I am giving you the children's rate.
I'm not a shopper. An old man sleeping on a rope
bed. Living behind the Chinese groceries.
-I'd know it.
-You want to be kept in whiskey.
I wouldn't buy that.
I'd confiscate it.
Enough for a quart.
Ah, thank you.
Hundred dollars, that’s the rate.
Then I shall not haggle.
Can we depart this afternoon?
We?
You're not going, that ain't no part of it.
You have misjudged me if you think I'm silly enough
to give you fifty dollars and watch you simply ride off.
I am a bonded U.S. Marshall.
Don't waste .... little with me.
I will see the thing done.
Damn ducks, can't go after Ned Pepper
Mans' a hard man, and to look after
a baby at the same time.
I am not a baby.
Won't be staying at boarding houses,
where there's one bed and hot grub on the table.
Like to grab the saddle, eatin' light.
Where the sleeping would only
take place on the ground.
Well I have slept out a night before.
Papa took me on a fine coon hunt
last summer on the Petty G.
We were on the hunt all night.
We sat around a big fire and told ghost stories.
We had a good time.
Coon hunt?
This ain't no coon drive.
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.
To many important mouths to feed.
You would be assure to make
your work harder than it is.
Here's the money.
Now I aim to get Tom Chaney,
and if you are not gamed, I will find
somebody who is gamed.
All I've heard out of you so far is talk.
I know you can drink whiskey, and snore and spit
and wallow in filth and bemoan your station.
The rest has been spread to tie oh.
They told me you had grit, and
that is why I came to you.
I'm not paying for you talk. I can get all the talk
I need at the boarding house.
Wave your money.
Meet me here at seven o'clock tomorrow morning
and we can begin our 'coon hunt'.
(Mattie)
Dearest mother,
I'm about to embark on a great adventure.
I have learned that Tom Chaney has
fled into the wild.
And I shall assist the authorities in pursuit.
You know that Papa would want me
to be firm in the right.
As he always was.
So do not fail on my account.
Tho I walk through the valley, of the shadow of death.
I shall fear no evil.
The author of all things watches over me, and
I have a fine horse.
Kiss little Frankie for me,
and pinch Violet's cheek.
My Papa's death will soon be avenged.
I'm off for the Choctaw nation,
Where's Marshall Cogburn?
Went away.
Left this.
(Rooster)
Here inside is a train ticket for your return home.
Use it.
By the time you read this, I will be across
the river in the Indian Nation.
Pursuit will be futile.
I will return with your man, Chaney.
Leave me to my work.
Rueben Cogburn.
Is that Rooster Cogburn?
Rider is in there.
Who's he with?
I do not know.
Well take me across.
So, you're the runaway.
Marshall told me you'd show up.
I'm going to present you to the Sheriff.
That is a story, let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.
If you don't turn around and take me across,
You'll find yourself incorporated on the B.
I have a good lawyer.
HEY!
Go, Little Blackie.
Come on.
That is quite a horse.
Probably give you ten dollars for him.
From the money you stole from me?
That was not stolen, I'm after your man.
I was to accompany you.
If I do not there is no agreement and
my money was stolen.
Let's get this child back on the ferry
It's a long road and time's a wasting.
If I go back it's to the U.S. Marshals office
to report the theft of my money.
And fuedal Marshall Cogburn?
Pursuit would be futile?
It's not spelled, F-U-D-E-L.
It's time for your spanking.
Now you would DO it. No more speaking.
Or will get myself a burr switch
and strap your leg.
Are you going to let him do this, Marshall.
No, I don't believe I will.
Put your switch away, La Boeuf.
I aim to finish what I started.
That'll be the biggest mistake you ever made.
Let's check this brass popper.
Pulled around by a little girl.
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.
In Texas we make due with a fire
a little more than twigs.
Buffalo chips.
Heat the nights rations of beans.
And it is ranger,
policy never to make the camp
the same place as your cook fire.
Very imprudent to make your presence
known in unsettled country.
How do you know Baggett had intelligence?
He has a store.
That makes him an authority on movements
in the Territory?
We have battered a wild place.
The men who were coming in,
wasn't any kind of supply.
Did not pick and choose the portal.
That is a piece of boogus.
All the snakes are asleep this time of year.
They've been known to wake up.
Well let me have a rope, too.
Likely not bother you.
You are to little and boney.
You should fetch the water.
Put it on the fire.
-First one out goes in.
-I'm not going down there again.
You want anymore water,
you can go fetch it yourself.
You're lucky to be traveling in a place
with a spring so handy.
In my country you could ride for days and
see no ground water.
I have lapped filthily water from a hoof print.
And was glad to have it.
If I believe one of you Texas boys.
Who says he had never drank
water out of a horse track'
I think I'd shake his hand and
give him the dandy wet sugar.
You do not believe it?
Oh, I believe it, the first twenty
thousand times I heard it.
Maybe, might be just true.
Maybe lapping water off the ground is
Ranger policy.
You're getting ready to show your ignorance
now, Cogburn.
I don't mind a little personal chaffing.
But I won't hear anything against the
Ranger troop from a man like you.
How long you boys been mounted
on sheep down there?
My white Appaloosa will still be galloping,
when that big American stud of yours
is winded and collapsed.
Now make another joke about it.
You want to try to put on
a show for this girl, Mattie.
With what you must think is a keen tongue.
This is like women talking.
Yes, that is the way.
Make me out foolish in this girls eyes.
At least she has you pretty well figured.
Would you two like to hear the
story of the 'Midnight caller'?
One of you is gonna have to be the caller.
Now I'll tell you what to say.
Now I'll do all the other parts myself.
-Good morning, Marshall.
-Morning.
Where's Mr. La Boeuf?
Down by the creek performing his necessaries.
Marshall Cogburn, I welcome
the chance for a private parley.
I gather that you and Mr. La Boeuf have come to some,
some sort of agreement.
And as your employer I believe
I have the right to know the particulars.
Particulars?
Is that we're bring Chaney down
to the magistrate,
and since I'm with Texas wherein there's a
considerable reward on him for which we split.
I did not want him brought to Texas,
to have a Texas punishment administered
for a Texas crime.
That was not our agreement.
What you want is to have him caught
and punished.
I want him to know he's being punished
for killing my father.
Well, you can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.
You can spit on him.
Or I can make a meat saddle out of him.
I can hold him down.
I'll tell you what.
I'll flay the flesh off the souls of his feet.
Find you Indian pepper you
can rub in his wound.
Isn't that a hundred dollar value?
No, it is not.
When I have brought and paid for
something, I will have my way.
Why do you think I'm paying you,
if not to have my way.
You will learn.
You cannot have your way.
In every little particular.
You find I failed to satisfied your terms.
I'll return your money at the end
of this expedition.
Little Blackie and I are ridding back
to the U.S. Marshall's office, this is fraud.
What ever.
What's going on?
This is a business conversation.
Is that what you call it?
Sounds to me you're still being
hoo-rod by a little girl.
-You say, hoo-rod?
-That was the point.
There is no hoo-rahing.
In my agreement with the Marshall,
anti-dates you. It has the force of law.
The force of law?
This man is a notorious thumper.
He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill.
-Bloody Phil Amers.
-Them men were patriots, Texas trash.
They murdered women and children
in Lawrence Kansas.
That's a God damn lie!
What army was you in, Mister?
I was at Treeport.
First with Kirby Smith, then with...
What side was you on?
I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn.
And I don't have to hang my head
when I say it.
If  you served with Captain Quantrill.
Captain!
Captain Quantrill.
That...indeed.
-Just let this go, La Boeuf.
-Captain of what?
We're done.
There's not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas,
to make it worth my while to
listen to your business.
Our agreement is nullified.
That suits me.
See's man for himself.
Congratulations, Cogburn.
You've graduated from a rotter,
to a wet nurse.
A-dios.
We don't need him, do we Marshall?
Gonna miss his sharp Carbine.
'Cept you'd get lock jaw.
HEY!
Go on.
You stay here, sister.
And I'm going to sit back.
Has Chaney been here?
No.
Cole Cade was, two days ago.
Cole rides with Lucky Ned.
Brought supplies with this.
Well this is Papa's gold piece.
Tom Chaney here we come.
Not that rare, a California gold piece.
They are rare here.
How rare?
What if it is, Chaney's?
Just as easily came upon a lucky nugget
Gang fell upon them as he fell into them.
Chaney could be a corpse.
That would be a bitter disappointment
Marshall, what would we do?
Um, pursue them.
Ned's unfinished business for the Marshall's anyhow.
We have him, we'll also have Chaney.
Wouldn't know the whereabouts
of his body.
Bagget didn't know which way they went.
now that we know they come through here.
They couldn't have gone but one or two ways.
Heading north, towards the winding stairs mountains.
Push them further west.
I expect north, over all.
I found an eating place.
Called the 'Green frog'.
Started calling myself, burro.
But my drinking’s picked up.
My wife did not care for the company
of my river friends.
She decided to go back to her fist husband.
Clerk in a hardware store.
That was when she said,
Goodbye Ruben.
Loved the beefing season,
could not abid it here.
First divorced woman that,
talked about beefing season.
I told her, goodbye Molo.
Hope that little mail son of a bastard
will keep you happy this time.
She took my boy with her too.
He never cared for me anyway.
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.
I did not mean anything by it.
When it comes to your child .
I bet he broke before he cut.
Is it, Chaney?
I would not recognize the
souls of his feet.
Well, you'll have to clamber up and look.
I'm to old and to fat.
Now the Green Frog had one billiard table.
Complained that I had bad ball.
Most of the time, had been
running it for myself for a while,
to keep good health.
Never did learn how to buy meat.
That him?
I believe not.
Well, cut him down.
Why?
I might know him.
Last time I went out to the
state plains of Texas.
Shoot buffaloes with a camp chaplain and
a tribe Indian name Malle.
Now the Mormons. They run a
shelter down the great Salt Lake city.
Never asked me before.
Thought it was a misunderstanding
and leave it go at that.
Well, the Chinese.
They'll all gone now.
Didn't see them.
Give three dollars right now for
pickled buffalo tongues.
Why did they hang him so high?
Probably do something awful.
Must play in the belief
it'll make him more dead.
I do not know this man.
You hanged him?
Why did he take the hanged man?
Did he know him?
He did not.
But it is a dead body.
Must be worth something in the trade.
Now my second wife, Edna.
She got the notion. She wanted
me to be a lawyer.
Bought this heavy book on Daniel
and negotionable instruments.
Set to make me reading it.
Never could get a grip on it.
I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.
There ain't six trees between here and Canada,
Nothing else grows that has stickers on it.
Ask them...
-I knew it.
-Knew what?
We're being followed.
I asked that injun to signal me a shot
if someone was on our trail.
Should we be concerned, Marshall?
Naw, Mr. La Boeuf is giving us
his bird dog.
He wants to cut it in, once it flushed his prey.
Perhaps we could double back over our
tracks and confuse the trail in a clever way.
No, we will wait right here.
Offer our friend a warm hello.
Ask him where he's going.
You are not La Boeuf.
My name is Forrester.
I practice,
Dentistry in the nation.
Also veterinary arts.
And medicine.
On those humans that will sit still for it.
You have your work cut out for you there.
Traded for him with an Indian who said he
came by him honestly.
I gave up two dental mirrors
and a bottle of expectorant.
Do either of you need
Medical redemption?
No, claim. fixing to get cold.
You  know of anywhere to take shelter?
I have my bear skin.
You might want to head over
to the Original Crazy Bob.
He launched a dug out in the hollow
along the Carolina river.
If you ride the river.
You won't fail to see it.
Crazy Bob, the original.
Crazy Bob.
There's  nothing north of the picket wire.
They would not give refuge.
-Much obliged.
-Now, I have taken his teeth.
I will entertain an offer,
for the rest of him.
Take my jacket.
Creep up on the roof.
If they're unfriendly I'll give you a sign
to damp the chimney.
Who is out there?
We're looking for shelter.
There's nothing here, go on.
Who’s' in there?
I'm a federal officer.
Who's in there?
It's a son of a bitch.
This is Rooster Cogburn.
Columbus Potter and five other Marshall’s
is out here with me.
We got a bucket of coal oil.
In one minute we will burn your
house from both ends.
There's only two of you.
Go ahead and bet your life on it.
How many of you is in there?
Just the two of us.
But my partner's hit.
And he can't walk.
Is that Emmet Quincy?
You said it was a man on the roof.
I thought it was Potter.
It has always been Quincy that I
might be true to form.
Seems an awful lot of salt beef.
You boys looking for company?
No, that was supper and breakfast both.
I like a big breakfast.
South bounds always cooks up
bigger than they think.
Hmm, you keep store whiskey here as well.
What are you boys up to outside
of cooking for banquets?
We're just having our supper.
Not even a hooter's outside in weather like this.
Might have been some crazy man.
Anyone can say that he is a Marshall.
My leg hurts.
I bet it does.
When was the last time you see
your ol' pard, Ned Pepper?
I do not know that.
Who is he?
I'm surprised you don't remember him.
Skinny fellow, wears a recent quid,
face all messed up.
That don't bring anybody to mind.
There's a new boy.
Might be running with Ned.
He'll have a palming mark on his face,
black polish.
Call's himself Chaney.
He's Chelmsford sometimes.
Carries a Henry rifle.
That don't bring anybody to mind.
Black mark, I would remember that.
You don't remember nothing
right now, do you Quincy?
What do you know, Moon?
He don't know those boys you're
looking for.
I don't know those boys.
I always try to help out the law.
Know by the time I get to Fort Smith,
that leg will be swelled up as tight
as this hat band.
It'll be mortified.
Then they'll have to cut it off.
Then if you live, I'll make it two or
three years in the federal house.
-Up in Detroit, there.
-I'm trying give up.
They'll teach you how to read
an write up there.
The rest won't be so good.
Them boys, they can be
hard on a gimp.
Trying to get at me.
Now.
You give me some good information
on Ned.
I'll take you down to the back of the store tomorrow,
I'll get that ball taken out of your leg.
Then I'll give you three days to
clear the territory.
We don't know those boys
you're looking for.
-It ain't even his leg.
-I was...
Quiet now, it's best you let me do the talking.
-I'll say I...
-We, weary trackers.
Who worked you over with the ugly stick?
The man Chaney with the marked face,
killed my father.
It was a whiskey drinker like you
and I rather kill him in the end.
If you answer the Marshall's questions,
he will help you.
I have a good lawyer, and I know
he will help you too.
I'm puzzled by this.
Why is she here?
Joe, these people. Don't you be
jawing with that girl.
I don't like you. I hope you go to jail
my lawyer will not help you.
My leg is giving me fits.
A young fellow like don't want to loose his leg.
-Moon, he's lying.
-Is he now.
He's trying to get at you.
-With the truth.
-We seen Ned and Hays two days ago.
Don't you act the fool,
you go on I will kill you.
I'm played out, I need a doctor.
We met Nate Hayes two days ago.
God damn it.
Oh Lord.
I'm dying.
Do something.
Help me.
I can do nothing for you, son.
You partner's killed you, as I done for him.
Don't leave me lying here.
Don't let the wolves rip me up.
I'll see you're buried right.
You talking about Ned, where'd you see him?
Two days ago.
Babbett's store.
They were coming here tonight to get remounts.
They just wired, wagon wheelers switch.
I'm gone.
Send the news to my brother, George Garrett.
He is Methodist Circuit rider south Texas.
Shall I tell him you've outlawed up.
It don't matter.
He knows I'm under skilled.
I will meet him later, walking
the streets of glory.
Well don't be looking for Quincy.
What will we do when they get here?
Well they will ride up.
Hope we get them all in the dugout.
I'll kill them the last one that goes in,
that way we'll have them in the barrow.
You will shoot them in the back?
Mmm, will give them the know
our intention is serious.
Then they'll fall down.
See if they'll be taken alive.
If they want.
I'll shoot them if they come out.
I'm hoping that three of the party
dead will take the spark out of them.
You just play great place.
Aw, I just triple shooten.
One time, into Mexico,
we was being pursued by seven men.
I turned bolt around and taken them
reins in my teeth,
rode right up them boys. Fired up them
two eighty-sixes I carry in my saddle.
Well..
I guess there's old married men who loved their
families as they scattered and run from them.
Well that is hard to believe.
-Was it?
-A man riding at seven.
Well, it's true.
You go for a man hard enough and fast enough,
You're don't have time to think about how
many women, he would think about himself.
I might get clear of that rat that's
about to sit down on you.
Why were they pursuing you?
I robbed a high interest bank.
Can't rob a thief, can you.
Never robbed a citizen.
Never took a mans watch.
It is all stealing.
That's the position they took
in New Mexico.
Wasn't them.
Do not fear them to send a scout.
Damn.
It is La Boeuf.
Oh, we have to warn him, Marshall.
Too late.
What will we do, Marshall?
We sit, what does he do.
Maybe they want to chat.
That's Lucky's men.
Oh, that's that.
Well that didn't pan out.
You managed to put a kink
in my rope, partner.
Ah, I'm severely injured.
Yes, you got rocks on.
I was also shot.
By a rifle.
Well that’s because my scheme
did not developed as well as I planned.
You've been shot in the shoulder,
but the bullet passed through.
What happened to your mouth?
I believe I bit myself.
Couple of teeth loose, and ah yeah.
Tongue bit almost through.
I see it's a little nip
so I'll just yank it free.
I know a teamster.
Bit his tongue off as he was thrown
from a horse.
After a time he learned to make
seven or less noises understood.
I'll just yank it free.
Look at that now.
What's that now?
Let it be a bit.
Ah, very well.
It's impossible to bind
a tongue wound.
To bad, we just run across a Doctor.
-Marshall?
-Forrester, but he did not know where
he was headed.
I saw him too, that's how I intend
to be here.
Neither of these men are Chaney.
I know it, I know them both.
That ugly one is Poke Hayes.
And the uglier stiff is Clement Permalee
Permalee and his brothers have a silver
claim in winding stair mountains.
And I bet that's where Lucky Ned's gang is riding.
Well, we'll sleep here.
We'll follow in the morning.
But we promised to bury
the poor soul inside.
Grounds to hard.
That man wanted a decent burial,
he should have gotten himself killed in summer.
Sleep well, Little Blackie.
I have a notion that tomorrow we will
reach our object.
We're hot on the trail.
Seems that we'll overtake Tom
Chaney at winding stairs mountain.
I had not want to be in his shoes.
Chelmsford, as he called himself in Texas.
Shot the Senator's dog.
When the Senator remonstrated.
Chelmsford shot him as well.
Now you could argue that the shooting of
the dog was clearly an instance of mali-prohibited.
But the shooting of the Senator is indubitably
a instance of mailicide.
A double and mali-what?
Neither of them safe.
The distinction is between an
act that is wrong within itself.
And an act that is wrong according
to our laws and rights.
It is Latin.
I'm struck.
Hey, La Boeuf.
I've been shot, trampled.
But he has severed his tongue.
Not only does he not cease to talk.
But he spills the banks of English.
I was within three hundred yards of
Tom Chaney.
The closest I have been.
With a sharps carbine that is within range.
But I was not,
I had the choice of firing off hand.
Resist Theron and shoot the rest.
Just relax once I dogged him, the distance.
I fired at him.
He fired back.
You cannot  hit a man three hundred yards
if your gun was resting on your boulders.
A soft carbine is an instrument of
uncanny balance and precision.
I've no doubt that the gun is sound.
<i>(Sings "Greer County")

Greer county bantler.
I do not believe he slept.
Your minced, and helping, Mister La Boeuf.
and I would have turned the preacher you had
to head southward. Out here
a one-armed man look like an easy prey.
And a one eyed man who can't shoot.
Why don't you turn back, Cogburn?
I'll do fine.
I know what a parity claim is. I'm uninjured,
well provisioned and we agree to separate.
In confidence you cannot shy our agreement.
You're the one that shot me.
Mr. La Boeuf has a point, Marshall.
It is unfair leg up in any competition
to shoot your opposite member.
God damn it. I do not accept as
a given that I did shoot La Boeuf.
There were plenty of guns going off.
I heard the rifle, and I felt the ball.
You missed your shot, Cogburn.
Missed my shot!
You are handicapped without the eye,
then I without the arm.
I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards.
That timing man has brung
the cheap shells on me again.
I thought you were going to say,
the sun was in your eyes.
That is to say, "your eye".
Two at one time.
I'm going to chuck one high.
Go far.
-There.
-There?
-My bullet.
-Your bullet?
If you hit what you aim at,
explain my shoulder.
Gentlemen, shooting corn bread out on the prairie
is getting us no closer to the Pepper gang.
One more. This will prove it.
Please hold fire.
Find our way back.
Lucky Ned?
LUCKY NED!
Very good, Cogburn.
Now what?
Oh, god damn it.
Cogburn you might want to be
eating out of a store.
I'm assuming you might be hungry.
And it was my store not...
Let him starve.
He did not track.
He did not shoot.
Accepting food stuffs.
What is your initiative?
You talking tribute.
A man, who walks in front of bullets.
Mr. La Boeuf drew single handed
upon the Lucky Ned Pepper gang.
while we fired safely from cover.
-We?
-It is unfair to indict a man,
when his jaw is swollen, and tongue mangled
and is therefore unable to rise to his defense.
I can speak for myself.
I'm courtly obliged to answer the ravings
of a drunkard who is beneath me.
I shall  make my own camp.
Elsewhere.
It is you that has nothing to
offer, Cogburn.
A sad picture indeed.
This is no longer a man hunt.
It is a debauch.
The Texas Ranger.
Presses on, alone.
Take the girl.
I bow out.
A fine thing to decide once you brought her
in the middle of the Choctaw nation.
I bow out, I wash my hands.
Gentlemen we cannot fall out in this fashion.
Not so close to our goal, with
Tom Chaney nearly in hand.
Damn!
I'm sure there's a silent grave
somewhere between here and Fort Smith.
He is gone.
Long gone.
Thanks to Mr. La Boeuf, we missed our shot.
With Bob and the boys have flown.
Gone, gone, gone.
Lucky Ned's cohort gone.
Your fifty dollars, gone.
Gone with whiskey.
Seems to know that.
The trail is cold as is the weather.
I'm....I'm a foolish old man who'd been
drawn into a wild goose chase.
by a harpy in trousers,
and a nincompoop.
Ah, Mr. La Boeuf.
He can wander the Choctaw nation
for as long as he likes.
Perhaps the local Indians will take him in.
Honor his .. by making him Chief.
You sift her, and go where you like.
Our engagement is terminated.
I bow out.
I'm going with you.
No, that is not possible.
Have I held you back?
I have a colt in my wardrobe,
and I know how to use it.
And I will be no more a burden to you,
as I was to the Marshall.
That's not my worry.
You've earned your spurs.
That is clear now.
You've been an regular
old hand on the trail.
But Cogburn's right.
I will not give him the satisfaction
of saying it.
The trail is cold.
And I am,
considerably diminished.
How can you give up now. After the many months
you've dedicated to finding Chaney?
You have shown great determination.
I misjudged you.
I picked the wrong man.
I would go on with your company,
if there were a clear way to go.
But we'd be striking out blindly.
Chelmsford's gone.
We chased him right up the mountain.
There's nothing for him.
I'm bound for Texas.
Time for you to go home, too.
The Marshall, when he's sobers.
Bring your way back.
I will not go back. Not without Chaney,
dead or alive.
I misjudged you as well.
I extend my hand.
Mr. La Boeuf, please.
Adios.
I know you.
Your name is, Mattie.
You're little Mattie, the bookkeeper.
Isn't that something.
Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.
What you doing out here?
Come to fetch some water.
No, what are you doing in these mountains, here.
While I've not been formerly deputized,
but I'm acting as an agent for,
Marshall Rooster Cogburn,
and Judge Fockers court.
I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.
Well I will not go.
How do you like that?
There's a posse of officers up there
that will force you to go.
That is interesting news.
And how many is up there?
Right around fifty.
They're all well armed and they mean business.
What I want you to do now, is to come
over across the creek and come up on that hill.
I think I'll oblige the officers who's
come after me.
Well if you refuse to go, then
I'll have to shoot you.
Oh.
Well you'd better cock your piece.
All the way back.
-Throw lock
-I know how to do it.
You will not go with me?
Naw, it's just the other way around.
You're going with me.
I'm...AAAH!
Well I didn't think you'd do it.
-What do you think now?
-One of my short ribs is broken.
You killed my father when he was trying to help you.
I have one of the gold pieces you stole
from him. Now give me the other.
-Things aren't going right for me.
-MATTIE!
I'm down here.
Now I'm shot by a child.
Chaney's taken into custody.
Help me.
MATTIE!
Marshall.
Look who's you got, fool.
Bob, you go on up that hill, don't you stop.
What's down there?
Marshall Cogburn and fifty more officers.
You tell me another lie and I'll
stove your head in.
Just the Marshall.
Rooster.
Cogburn!
You hear me?
You answer me, Rooster.
I will kill this girl.
You know I will do it.
She means nothing to me,
your the one I'm after for.
That is all very well.
Do you advise that I kill her?
Do what you think is best, Ned.
She's nothing to me but a lost child.
Think it over.
I have already thought it over.
You'll get buried double fast.
If I see you riding over
that bald ridge to the northwest.
I will spare the girl.
You have five minutes.
They will be a party of Marshall’s here
soon, Ned.
Let me have the girl and Chaney and I will
just leave you for two down.
To thin Rooster.
To thin.
Your five minutes is running.
No more talk.
Run up that hill.
Well, they taught moon.
Can I have some of that bacon?
You help yourself.
They'll soon be coffee.
I do not drink Coffee yet, I am fourteen.
Well we do not have buttermilk,
and we do not have bread.
We are poorly supplied.
-Where she is.
-What are you doing here?
I aught to ring your scrawny neck.
You let that go.
What happened, huh?
I will tell you, and you will see that
I'm in the right.
Tom Chaney there shot my father to death..
at Fort Smith and robbed him of..
two gold pieces and stole his mare.
I was informed of Mr. Cogburn to wit. And
hired him to find the murderer.
Moments ago I spotted Chaney watering the horses.
He had taken to charge and I shot him.
If I killed him I would not be now in this
fix, but my gun misfired.
That will do it.
It will embarrass you every time.
Most girls like to play pretty,
but you like guns, do ya?
I do not care a thing in the world about guns.
If I did I would have one that worked.
I was shot in an ambush, Ned.
Horses were drawn making noise, it was that officer that got me.
How can you sit there and tell such a big story?
That pit is a hundred feet deep,
and I will throw you in.
While I leave you screaming in rot.
-Now how do you like that?
-I know why.
This man will not let you have your way. He's your boss
and you have to do as he tells you.
Ain't nothing going my way.
Was that Rooster that waylaid
them night before last?
It was Marshall Cogburn and myself.
You and, Cogburn.
Quite the posse.
Let us move, Ned.
In good time, Bob.
What happened to Quincy and the kid?
They're both dead.
It was very in the very middle of it,
it was a terrible thing to see.
Please, let us move, Ned.
Marshall's gone.
Do you need a good lawyer?
I need a good judge.
What happened to Poke Hayes?
The fellow shot off his horse.
Dead as well.
These declarations have come to an end.
Your friend Rooster does
not collect many prisoners.
He is not my friend.
He’s a bandy man in a carnage of mounts.
You do not varnish your opinion.
Are we off?
Let us cut up the winch from the cages line.
They'll be time for that at the old place.
How about the mare?
Well, those aren't the plans.
Unless I dug them out with a doctor.
-Move.
-Nope.
We can't chance with two men up
come from the brace.
Found your way here with the girl.
We reach Miles house I'll send Harold
back with some fresh mounts.
We'll be out by dark.
We'll meet you at the old place.
I do not like that.
Let me ride with you, Ned.
Just out here anyway.
I was short a horse.
The Marshall’s will come swarming.
Hours, if the come here at all.
They'll think that we've all gone.
I am not staying here by myself
with, Tom Chaney.
That's the way I will have it.
He will kill me.
You heard him say it. He's killed my father,
and now you will let him kill me.
He will do no such thing.
Tom. You know the cross in the cypress forest,
to the log Wheaton house.
When you mount it, you take
the girl and leave her there.
You understand, Tom?
Any harm comes to that child,
you'll not get paid.
Harold, let me ride up with you.
Harold, I will pay you fifty dollars out of my wage.
I am not happy.
Do the calf again, Harold.
Everything is against me.
You have no reason to whine.
You act as the bandit Chief instructed
and no harm comes to me you'll get your wages.
Lucky Ned has left me alone. I am sure
to be caught. I'll be on foot.
Must think over my position
and how I may improve it.
Where's the second California gold piece?
What have you done with Papa's mare?
Keep still.
Are you thinking about the old place?
Look here, if you let me go.
I will swear to an affidavit..
and once you are brought to justice,
it may go easier on you.
I tell you I can do better.
I don't need your affidavit.
All I need is your silence.
You followed a busybody like you.
To be honest, I do not regret
shooting him.
He thought Tom Chaney was small.
Humor me.
You will give me an affidavit.
You're all against me, everybody....
That is, Chelmsford.
Strange to be so close to him at last.
Mr. La Boeuf, how is it that you are here?
I heard a shot.
Went down to the river.
Cogburn outlined a plan.
Mind your foot, there's a pit there.
His part,
I fear is rash.
He returns for Lucky Ned.
Yo, Rooster!
We will cross the road.
This ford is ill advised.
He could not be dissuaded.
Well Ned, how many men is with the girl?
Just Chaney.
My will is enforced.
She was in excellent health,
when last I saw her.
Farrell, I want you and your brother
to stay clear.
Do it well, Proctor.
Have no interest in you today.
What is your intention, Rooster?
You think one eye follows a downfall?
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.
Or see you hanged at Fort Smith
at Judge Parker's convenience.
Which will you have?
I call that, bold talk.
From a one-eyed fat man.
Feel your hand, you son of a bitch.
Shoot them Mr. La Boeuf.
To far, moving to fast.
Well, Rooster?
I'm shot to pieces.
Seems neither of us,
gets to see Judge Parker.
Wahooo!
Some bully shot.
That was four hundred yards at least.
Well,
the sharps carbine, is a...
Stand up, Tom Chaney.
M...Mr. La Boeuf
Are you alive?
Mr. La Boeuf!
Mr. La Boeuf.
Mr. La Boeuf.
Are you there?
I'm here.
Can you clamber out?
I cannot.
There are snakes.
They awake?
Not yet.
I'm bit.
Does Mr. La Boeuf survive?
He did. Only a blow to the head
could silence only for a few short minutes.
Where you bit?
Look away, Mattie.
A heft.
Up with us.
Work it, La Boeuf pack her.
She's snake bit.
We're off.
I'll send help for you as soon as I can.
Don't wander off.
We are not leaving him.
If we don't get to Doc's, I says
you are not going to make it.
I'm your debt for that shot, pard.
Never doubt a Texas Ranger.
Come on.
Ever stalwart.
We must stop.
Little Blackie is played out.
We've miles yet.
Come on you.
NO!
No.
That's it, come on now.
No, stop.
He's getting away.
Who's getting, sis?
Chaney.
No.. NO!
NO, no, no.
Oh, no.
No, stop.
I've grown old.
(Grown up Mattie)
A quarter century is a long time.
By the time we reached Baglee's store,
my hand had turned black.
I was not awake when I lost the arm.
The Marshall had stayed with me, I was told.
'til I was out of danger.
But he departed before I came around.
Once home. I wrote him with an invitation,
to come by, the next time he found
himself near Yell county.
And collect the fifty dollars I still owed him.
I did not hear back from Marshall Cogburn.
And he did not appear.
Then one day I received a note from
the Marshall, with a flyer enclosed.
He said he was traveling with the Wild West show.
Getting older and fatter.
But I like to come visit him when the show
came to Memphis, and swap stories
with an old trail mate.
He would understand if the journey was to long.
Brief tho his note was.
It was rife with misspellings.
Yesum?
I am, Cole Younger.
This is Mr. James.
It grieves me to tell you that you have missed, Rooster.
He passed away three days ago.
When the show was at Jonesboro Arkansas.
Buried him there at a Confederate cemetery.
Ruben had a complaint what he referred to as,
Night hawks.
And I believe the warm weather was to much for him.
We had some lively times.
What was the nature of your acquaintance?
I knew the Marshall long ago.
We too had, lively times.
Thank you, Mr. Younger.
Keep your seat, trash.
I had the body removed to our plot and
I had visited it over the years.
No doubt people talked about that.
They say, "Well, she hardly knew the man".
"Isn't she a cranky old maid".
It is true, I have not married.
I never had time to fool with it.
I heard nothing more of the Texas
officer, La Boeuf.
If he is yet alive. I would be pleased
to hear from him.
I judge he would be in his seventies now.
And near eighty in seventy.
I expect some of the starch has gone
out of that cowlick.
Time just gets away from us.
