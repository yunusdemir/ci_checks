Turn around.
I'll see you out there. Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, motherfuckers!
- We'll fuck your ass up, man!
In 'The Prophet', Kahlil Gibran
writes about good and evil.
"Of the good in you, I can speak,
"but not of the evil."
You are only good when
you are at one with yourself.
What you went through in here
I wouldn't wish on any man.
But you survived.
You didn't ask for trouble.
But you didn't back down from it either.
It was as if you were born
to the darkness in this place.
I hope to God
that this day
you put that darkness behind you.
I want you to know
there is help on the outside.
So if you get to thinking it's too much
and you can't handle the pressure,
please call one of these numbers.
Do you have any questions?
Where's the exit?

What do we got?
- Yeah, I caught the case.
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah.
- You couldn't have.
Why is that?
Because Mallory would
never put you on my case.
Listen, I don't like this any more than you do.
I'm a couple of weeks away from retirement.
I got paperwork up my ass.
So when the supervising sergeant
tells me to jump,
I just go with the flow, baby.
- You can't smoke in here.
- Sorry.
Get me a good tight
shot of that exit wound.
<i>Breaking news!
It is being reported that a gunman</i>
<i>entered a downtown Bakersfield
office building this afternoon</i>
<i>and opened fire,</i>
<i>killing an employee, who worked
at Central Cal-Telemarketing.
- <i>The suspect remains at large.</i>
- Kenny, stop!
<i>He is described as a male in his 30s,</i>
<i>approximately 6"3" tall
with closely cropped hair.</i>
<i>Police have not yet released
the name of the victim.</i>
<i>The gunman was described
as armed and extremely dangerous.</i>
Let me call you right back.
Well, well!
You've been a bad boy.
It's a nice set of wheels I got you out there.
You got my money?
Now, how'd you smuggle
that much money out of prison?
You don't wanna know.
I want the other names.
The price just went up.
It took me 10 odd years
to track down these people for you.
And it cost a lot of money.
And now I wants to renegotiate.
Okay.
That's what I thought.
You're playing ball now. Hey, Ken--
The price just went down.
Kenny?
Kenny!
This here is my Samoan friend.
Ultimate Fighting champion over in Guam.
You don't know half the sick shit
they do over there just to win a title.
I know what that is.
- I know who you are.
- Who is he?
Brother, I ain't got no beef with you.
Stop bumping your gums
and do what I pay you to do.
- What are you doing?
- This dude's a ghost.
- I can't mess with no ghost.
- You better get your fat ass back here.
- I ain't messing with a ghost.
- Bald-headed Precious. Get your...
Here, I owe you a refund. Here you go.
He looks so familiar.
I have seen him somewhere, I know it.
Really?
All right, here it comes.
Look at his face.
He knew his number was up.
Wait a minute.
That's not just fear, that's recognition.
He can't see where the gun is
from where he's sitting.
It's blocked by the partition.
He knew him.
Maybe.
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Marina.
- Hey, it's me.
- <i>Do you know what time it is?</i>
Yes, I know. I know it's late, I'm sorry.
- <i>Call me right--</i>
- Okay, okay.
- <i>You're taking him to the game.</i>
- Yes, I'll be there tomorrow.
I'll pick him up tomorrow.
Yes, I'll be on time.

Morning.
You see, I did a sequence
of poses this morning
that only 10 people on the planet can do.
Ending with the corpse pose.
But you know what, I'm done with yoga.
I beat it.
- You beat yoga?
- Yeah.
It's time to move on.
To what?
I don't know.
Something more ultimate.
Sometimes I worry that a real corpse pose
is the only thing that's gonna satisfy you.
No! Come on, not death.
Life.
Oh, I've never felt so alive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
<i>Got a new client for you.
I know you like a challenge.</i>
<i>We're gathering information
on possible locations.</i>
<i>I'll send you the target spec now.</i>
<i>The client thinks the target's
coming after him.</i>
- <i>He needs the job done fast.</i>
- Okay.
Who's he?
It's not a question I ever ask.
- Sure you don't wanna stay a while?
- Hold that thought.
It's my work.
It's getting harder and harder
to go on these jobs.
<i>You mentioned this before
at our last session.</i>
- <i>Can you take some time off?</i>
- No, no, no, that's not an option.
In my business is important
that I keep my edge.
<i>You still haven't told me
what it is you actually do now.</i>
I'm a surgeon. I remove cancer.</i>
<i>Well, I'll have to take you at your word.</i>
<i>You know, I have other patients
in the medical field.</i>
<i>And they also find it hard to handle
the stress associated with their jobs.</i>
<i>There's a lot of pressure when you

Morning, Detective Cicero.
Sergeant Mallory.
Don't be mad.
You should've told me first.
You're right, you should've
heard it from me. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
Let him help you with the case though.
So, what do we got?
You play fast and loose
with that "we" shit, cowboy.
We got our shooter.
We?
I got a call from the warden
at Murdoch last night.
He recognized our guy in the news.
Apparently, he made a lot of money
running contraband in prison.
- Any gang affiliations?
- Nope, did his whole 10.
No protection. A walk-alone.
They kept coming after him.
He kept knocking them down.
I see he kept score.
Yeah, the warden said all he had to do was
flash that and no one would screw with him.
He got popped for a bank job.
Ten years ago, Bakersfield First.
Don't be a hero, you got me?
Stay down!
- So, shooter was a bank robber.
- He was the driver.
- Go, go!
- Get in!
Go, go, go, go!
Look out!
- What are you doing, man?
- Why are we stopping here, man?
- You're gonna get us all killed.
- Calm down, he knows what he's doing.
Do your thing, little brother.
Go, go, go, go!
Damn it, what's he doing?
Where're you going?
They passed. They passed. Do it!
- I don't see anyone else. I think we're clear.
- Slow down.
Slow down!
Turn it around. Turn it around!
You son of a...
Watch it, watch it, watch it!
- Cops, man!
- They're right there!
- You're good. Go.
- Cops, cops!
You're good, you're good, you're good!
Rip it. Rip it!
- Now, he made a clean getaway.
- So who collared him?
Good, this is where it gets really interesting.
I wanna show you something.
Check this out.
Oh, my.
This is such a big help.
It takes me such a long time
to get up those stairs.
- You can put the things down
anywhere over here. - Okay.
- You okay?
- Yes.
Thank you for your concern.
- You're very kind to help an old man.
- Sure.
- I'm gonna go.
- Can I offer you something to drink?
- Actually, I should be going.
- No, let me get you something. It's right here.
Please, it's the least I can do.
Be nice to have a little
company for a change.
You see, I changed careers, because l...
Well, I had some issues
I needed to resolve.
You know, I needed to test myself.
Mentally and physically.
Really re-create myself.
<i>And now it's all become too easy.</i>
Yes. Yes.
I'm bored, but I mean, that's only part of it.
I mean, it's Lily.
She's a distraction.
Distractions can be a problem
in my line of work.
<i>You were going to talk to her
about marriage and having a family.</i>
<i>Is that still something you want?</i>
You know what? You're right.
I mean, she's the woman I wanna
spend the rest of my life with.
<i>So, are you going to ask her to marry you?</i>
That's what I'll do.
I'll pop the question.
- <i>Are you off your meds?</i>
- Yes.
<i>As your therapist,
I have to advise against that.</i>
Gotta go.
<i>All right, look, there's two cars.</i>
<i>Quiet.</i>
<i>All right, you're good.</i>
<i>All right, you guys. Boys, here we go.</i>
<i>Be quiet.</i>
<i>Back, back, back!</i>
<i>Hands up!</i>
<i>- Back up.
- Tell me what's going on here.</i>
After the bank job, they got
ambushed by another crew.
Somebody set him up.
And somebody taped it?
Sick bastard made
his own personal snuff film.
<i>- Where's the money?
- Tell them.</i>
I knew I remembered
this guy from somewhere.
Where the hell did you get this?
First week I made detective,
Vice busted this hard core porn operation.
I walked into the bullpen,
and they were watching this.
I pretended I got a phone call,
had to walk out.
Guess I didn't have the stomach for it.
<i>Bank robbers, huh?</i>
<i>- Tough guys.
- Don't tell them.</i>
I flipped it to Homicide,
but never went anywhere.
- Why is that?
- Never see the killers' faces. Not once.
<i>- Where's the money?
- Don't tell them, bro.</i>
<i>- Brothers?
- That's your brother?</i>
<i>I don't see the resemblance.</i>
<i>You want me to shoot him?
Huh? Like the others?</i>
<i>He's not gonna kill me, he's bluffing.</i>
<i>Bluffing? Two down and I'm bluffing?</i>
<i>- You want me to shoot him?
- Think twice.</i>
<i>You want me to shoot him,
huh, like the others?</i>
<i>- Don't you tell him.
- Please, don't shoot him.</i>
<i>- He's not gonna shoot.
- Let's just tell them where it is.</i>
<i>But it's our only leverage.</i>
<i>I'm sorry I got you into this, bro.</i>
<i>Just tell me where the money is.</i>
I bet you're a good student.
Yeah.
- Thanks for the drink.
- Sure.
I should get going.
<i>Sorry I got you into this, bro.</i>
<i>Sorry I dragged you into this.</i>
<i>- Last chance.
- Don't tell him, bro.</i>
<i>- Please, don't shoot him.
- Don't do it.</i>
<i>It's up to you.</i>
<i>Don't you tell him, bro. Don't tell him.</i>
<i>It's under the floorboards in the kitchen.</i>
<i>There you go.</i>
- Gary, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- It's gonna be okay, bro.
It's gonna be okay.
No!
Oh, Jesus, man, no!
No!
- Gotta get that money.
- Jesus, man!
Gary!
Told you, wouldn't shoot him.
- Watch him.
- Okay.
See if he's lying.
I got it.
Lift this up in the bag.
Hey. Hey.
Smile for the camera.
Smile for the camera.
I didn't know.
I didn't know any of that was gonna happen.
Don't, please! He made us do it.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
<i>Smile for the camera.</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill you all.</i>
They killed him.
- What do you mean they killed him?
- He was dead.
At least for a little while anyway.
The hospital pronounced him DOA.
Can you hear me?
Bullet hit here, ricocheted around the outside
of his skull, came out his cheek-bone.
He's got a metal plate holding
the back of his head together.
I mean, this guy refused to die.
And now, he must be going
after everyone in that video.
You said you wouldn't be late.
Where the hell have you been?
I'm sorry. I caught a case, homicide.
- You're supposed to take Tommy
to his baseball game. - Yeah.
And you made me late for my class too.
I'm sorry. It's a big deal, this case.
I saw it on TV. I do not wanna hear about it.
You want me to have full custody?
I will take full custody.
You know I don't want that. I don't want that.
- Then take him to his damn baseball game!
- Okay. All right.
What's up, champ?
- What position they got you playing up?
- Don't play much.
Well, you got an arm like a cannon.
I don't know why they wouldn't be
letting you play.
I know.
Maybe I should have a talk with that coach
and see if we can get you in there somewhere.
Maybe pinch-hit or something.
What do you say?
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, it's Cicero.</i>
<i>There's been another shooting.
I think this could be our guy.</i>
Yeah.
<i>Mallory wants you down
at the crime scene.</i>
- Okay, I'll be there in a little bit.
- <i>Uh-huh. 4045 Danson Road. Got it?<i/></i>
<i>I'll be there in an hour.<i/></i>
Hey, you know what?
I'm not gonna make it in today.
I'm taking my son to a baseball game.
It's really important that I be there.
Well, you know what?
That's just too bad.
All right, bye.
Good grief! Can you imagine that?
I already told them I had
a ball game to go to today.
Incredible! You're a full two hours late.
- John, did you--?
- So, what do we got?
What do you got?
Our guy did the world a favor on this one.
Found out who shot our snuff films.
So, we got a telemarketer and a sex
offender. What's next, a lawyer?
Whole shebang just got a whole lot weirder.
Witnesses placed a second shooter
at the scene.
After our suspect whacked Mr. Rogers,
he went and had a little shoot-out in the hall.
- Maybe an armed neighbor?
- Uh-uh.
No one recognized this dude.
They exchanged gunfire,
then disappeared. Both of them.
How about the second shooter,
any description?
The word "beautiful" came up.
- Beautiful?
- Like a movie star.
He punked me.
He's really that good?
<i>No, good's not even the right word.</i>
<i>I mean, you know,</i>
the dude's completely artless.
I mean, there's no sophistication
to him whatsoever.
But he's pure, you know?
No fear, no hesitation. There's nothing!
- He as fast as you?
- No, he's faster.
You'll get him.
How can you be so sure, hey?
Because you always do.
- <i>Baby.</i>
- Yeah?
Marry me.
Goddamn it! Shit!
Is that what I think it is?
Oh, the tattoo?
Yeah, tattoo.
Yeah, I was in the L.A. Crash Unit
before I got transferred up here.
Guns blazing, ass-kicking cops
with porno mustaches?
That Crash?
Yeah, is it so hard for you to believe?
Yeah.
Can I get in there?
That's where I met Marina, actually.
She was my CI.
You married your snitch?
Dude, that is wrong on so many levels.
Well, she was in really bad shape.
Got in rehab and we fell in love
and there you go.
Was she the only one in rehab?
That's ancient history.
You sure about that, Hoss?
Listen, I got 10 days to retirement.
Full benefits for me and my family,
so why would I screw that up?
It's all I got.
How long have you been clean?
Since my son was born.
Good for you.
David, come on.
David, did you forget something?
- You forgot my hug.
- Love you, Mommy.
Good job.
Oh, my God!
You can't do this.
Why did you come?
There's nothing for you here.
Why did you make me stop
coming to see you in prison?
I didn't see any sense of three wasted lives.
Three?
Was that him?
The boy?
David?
You shouldn't think...
You did a dime.
David's 8. Do the math.
When you cut me off, I gave the baby up.
Did you find a good family?
I had an abortion.
I'm sorry.
They know what you're doing.
I saw it on TV.
I hope you kill them all!
Shall we begin?
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Let's start a family.
- Family?
- Yeah.
What's gotten into you?
We'll sell the house by the lake,
and we'll get a Craftsman in Pasadena.
Fresh start.
You're serious about this, aren't you?
Yes.
And what about your work?
Well, what about it?
- Would you quit before this job?
- Absolutely.
I will quit absolutely.
Just like that?
Just like that.
Marina!
Listen honey, let me in just
for a second. I need to talk to you.
I'm gonna stand here all day if you don't
let me in, so you may as well do it.
Marina.
<i>Killed, the first victim was
gunned down less than an hour</i>

<i>While the second victim was brutally shot...</i>
What are you doing here?
I thought you didn't care about my case.
<i>...connected to a bank robbery
at Bakersfield 10 years ago.</i>
Look, I do not need you coming here
and dragging us down again.
- Marina, if you just sit and talk to me.
- No!
I am getting my associate's degree.
I am trying to make something
better for Tommy and me.
Please take me back.
It'll be okay.
- It's not okay.
- Marina, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please!
God, what are you doing?
Get off your knees.
- Marina, please. Just please--
- Don't touch me!
Do not touch me.
- Give me the dope.
- I don't have any dope.
Give it to me.
Okay. Here.
It's all I got.
Look, I'll go to rehab. I swear to God I will.
Let's go. Let's go right now.
I mean, after the case. I gotta finish
the case. I can't just walk out on that.
I just wanna be here with you for one night.
I mean, you know, with Tommy and...
Please.
Just one night.

I'm only kidding, man.
Go on, have a good time.
Welcome to the gentlemen's club.
It's a 2-drink minimum tonight, baby.
Hey, what's up, big dog?
I'm great.
Right.
Wake up, Joe.
I've been expecting you.
Joe.
- Joe.
- Huh?
Oh, Shelly.
Go outside and watch the door.
Only one of us is gonna make it out of here.
No matter who it is, Joe,

Go on.
All right, then.
I got a son.
Tell him I said I'm sorry.
I'm begging you.
He's speed-dial number 3.
I'm sorry. He made us take you down.
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
Your father's sorry.
<i>Who is this? Is he okay?</i>
<i>Did something happen?</i>
Yeah.
Something happened.
I thought you said you were done.
I have to finish this one first, baby.
You promised me you were quitting.
And I will. I will quit.
But after this one.
No, this isn't fair.
I didn't ask you to marry me.
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- Mm-hm.
- What if I told you you had to choose?
- Don't do that!
You used to be attracted to what I do.
I'm your wife now.
- What if he kills you?
- Lily!
Daddy?
Yeah?
I know I suck at baseball.
You don't have to pretend like I'm good.
You'll get better.
You just need to practice.
Maybe you and I can throw the ball
around one day. How's that?
- Okay.
- I gotta tell you a secret first, though.
- What, Daddy?
- I suck at baseball too.
You go to sleep, okay? I'll be back.
Jesus Christ!
Oh, Jesus!
Are you okay? Look at me, look at me!
Why did you do this?
I'm afraid.
What are you afraid of, honey?
We're going to hell for what we did.
Do you know what hell is?
It's not fire and devils.
All that stuff they taught you
when you was little.
We make our heaven and our hell
while we're alive.
Every time we cause pain.
Every time we cause suffering.
- <i>Cicero.</i>
- Hey, it's me. Did I wake you up?
No.
You said on your message
to give you a call, so...
Okay, here's the deal.
Both of our victims were informants.
- Could be something there, right?
- <i>Yeah, could be.</i>
Nice work.
Okay, I need you to follow up on it.
I gotta be in court all day, but I really
think we're getting close on this thing.
<i>It's gotta have something to do
with how they got set up, the ambush.</i>
Did you hear about that stabbing
in Henderson last night?
- Yeah, what about it?
- Well, I got a hunch it might be our guy.
No. It's not his MO.
Our guy's a shooter, not a stabber.
- Like I said, I got a hunch.
- Yeah, well, so did Quasimodo.
- Look where it got him.
- <i>I'm just gonna go ask a few questions.<i/></i>
After you do the follow-up, right?
I already got it cleared up with the
Henderson IC. I'm headed up there now.
Listen, I have to be in court all day.
I am asking you to do this. It's my case.
<i>They will bring us nothing,
but the same politics as usual.</i>
<i>I have fought to keep government honest,</i>
<i>save you money and to lower your taxes.</i>
<i>Above all, I will be someone
who listens to you.</i>
<i>The choice is simple.
Vote Margie Pageant.</i>
<i>In local news, a Henderson man
is fighting for his life this morning</i>
<i>after being brutally attacked

<i>The man is suffering
from multiple stab wounds.</i>
<i>Doctors at Clarl County Medical Center

<i>Hello?</i>

- Sponge.
<i>We think he'll be heading back

Doctor.
What the hell is that?!
Back in the room. Back in the room.
Police officer, get back.
- Police.
- He went that way.
- I'm a cop. Where'd he go?
- He went downstairs, officer.
<i>How do you have my dad's phone?<i/></i>
He asked me to call you.
<i>Are you the one who killed him?</i>
Yes.
<i>I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kill you.</i>
Do what you need to do.
But you better be sure,
'cause it's a long, dark road
you're headed down.
I lost him.
<i>The client wants to pull the job.</i>
No! No way. No way.
You tell him to back off.
- I've got this under control, all right?
- <i>You're running out of time.</i>
Where is the old man?
Dead.
- Don't lie to me.
- I'll show you the damn grave.
- How long ago?
- I don't know.
Three or four years.
Hold still.
Okay.
How long you been out?
Couple of days.
And why are you here?
Came here to kill the old man.
Why?
Because he set us up.
What makes you think that?
Gary went to him for advice on the
bank job, and he wanted full share.
Gary wouldn't give it to him.
So, do you think the old man was
capable of murdering his own son?
- Yeah.
- No.
Nope.
He couldn't have.
What makes you so sure?
I just... I just know.
Tell me.
Say it.
Mom.
Because...
he loved your brother too much.
I'm sorry.
And that's the truth and that's not your fault.
It wasn't like I could pretend you were his.
He was reminded of that
every time he looked at you.
You never stood a chance.
Sorry that I couldn't...
That I didn't protect you.
The beatings and...
Gary was the only one
who ever cared for me.
Why'd he pull you in on that job?
You were never a part of what they did.
When his driver fell out, I volunteered.
Why?
He owed the wrong people a lot of money.
And he needed me.
If it wasn't the old man, then who set us up?
<i>Driven by his passions and desires.<i/></i>
<i>You will never truly be free
unless you freely forgive.</i>
<i>Hate is like a chain around your neck</i>
<i>that leads you to places
you don't wanna go.</i>
<i>It'll lead you into darkness and desolation.</i>
<i>You become a slave to that hatred,</i>
<i>and it'll only lead to your own destruction.</i>
<i>You must break free.</i>
- Hey, cowboy.
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.
- You laid eyes on him at least.
- Hey, well done.
- Thanks, man.
I gotta call you back.
- Still in one piece.
- Good job.
Good lead, cowboy. You almost got him.
- We got close.
- Yeah.
It was a good hunch.
Well, even Quasimodo has his day.
- And don't ever hang up on me again.
- Roger that.
I hate to spoil your moment, but
I got something I wanna show you.
- I think we may have caught a break.
- You said "we" again.
I did.
Our latest victim was a CI too.
- So all three are informants.
- Mm-hm.
They've all got records,
armed robbery, rape, assault.
But none of them did any serious time.
They all snitched their way
out of the joint over and over.
- What are the odds of that?
- Slim or none.
I'm waiting on the informant logs now.
- Who are these guys here?
- Former accomplices of the first three victims.
Let's split them up and check them out, huh?
I'll take these guys.
<i>And I know there's not a man,
woman or child in this church today</i>
<i>that has not sinned.</i>
<i>But God did not bring you down
on this Earth to be perfect.</i>
<i>God wants you down here to be saved.</i>
<i>And when you're down with God,
God is eternally down with you.</i>
<i>When Jesus knew that his time was near,
when He knew that He was gonna die,</i>
<i>when He knew they would not take
that cup away from his lips,</i>
<i>His thoughts were not upon his own.<i/></i>
<i>His thoughts were for those that he loved.</i>
<i>His thoughts were for those
that he loved, and in preparing them.</i>
<i>Why is that?
He used the example of His birth.</i>
That's right. Here it is.
Jesus told them how a woman
goes through pain and sorrow
in the throes of childbirth.
But then as soon as she has delivered,
there is no more anguish.
After all the screaming,
after all the pushing,
after all the blood and the tears,
there's only joy that a new child
has been born.
And I'll tell you my...
Amen!
Sing me a song!
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.
You've been the subject of many of
my sermons these past few days.
I heard.
You heard. But did you listen?
Everything okay, baby?
Everything's just fine, honey.
I was just catching up with an...
...old acquaintance.
You go on home now.
Let's take a walk.
- Was that your son?
- Adopted.
One of five.
Wayward boys.
Not unlike me or you at that age.
You turned your life around.
Doesn't change what you did.
I wouldn't want it to.
I know it sounds cold,
but every good I've done
hinged on the evil I did.
- Who set us up?
- I don't know.
I never did find out how they
knew about your safe house.
When I got the call,
"easy money", they said.
All I had to do was guard
the door, be the lookout.
I was in a dark place in my life.
- Numb to the chaos and...
- Right here.
But when they cut that boy's throat...
<i>Oh, Jesus, man. No!</i>
That boy they killed was my brother.
I can't bring him back.
And in my heart I'm sorry.
I still took my cut,
spent it on drugs and women.
Ended up in prison.
But it was there that I found my calling.
To save and help boys like me.
And like you.
It was there that I gave my life to God.
God can't save you from me.
But maybe He could save you from yourself.
- I know there's good--
- You don't know me.
I know the devil got your heart twisted
with vengeance and hate.
The Lord is merciful.
He sees in your soul.
Fragile, ain't it?
That moment, that sets us
on our road to Damascus.
Sermon's over.
Can you at least find it in your heart
to forgive me for what I did?
I can't.
That's all right.
That's all right.
Because I forgive you
for what you're about to do.
# Who is that riding? #
# He's John, the Revelator #
# Tell me who's that riding #
# He's John, the Revelator #
Oh, Lord, see into this man's heart.
He's good inside.
Oh, Lord, save this man's soul.
I know You see his heart.
# Who's that riding? #
# He's John, the Revelator #
Release him from the bondage
of hatred and vengeance, Lord.
# Who's that riding? #
# He's John... #
Go back to your family.
That's one hell of a peashooter
you got there.
How's the recoil?
- Yeah.
- <i>Where the hell are you?</i>
Inyo County at the reservoir.
They're here. <i>Both of them.</i>
What? Did you call for back-up?
- There's no time for that.
- Okay, don't do this.
Look, Detective, I'm sorry
I keep stepping on your case.
- <i>Look, I don't care about that.</i>
- I want you to do me a favor, will you?
If I don't make it out of this,
tell my son that his daddy
went out like a man, will you?
I am on my way. Please, just wait for me.
I'm just going with the flow, baby.
Damn!
Aren't you gonna reach for it?
Come on.
Sporting chance.
I've got nothing against you.
I've been trying to kill you for the past 3 days,
and you've got nothing against me?
So, I'm starting to think you don't
take me very seriously, my friend.
What do you want from me?
How about a little respect, hey?
A little professional courtesy from a peer.
Some acknowledgment of my skills.
You've got issues.
Screw you.
I win.
You think you're done?
You can't put it together, can you?
There must be one more.
The one who hired me.
He's still alive.
<i>I'm gonna kill you all.</i>
Drop the gun.
Don't move.
Slowly.
Put the gun down.
- No.
- Put the goddamn gun down!
No! This is my job!
I finish my job.
How're you gonna finish this
when you're dead?
So you're the guy that hired me.
You shouldn't have done that.
I had to finish what I started.
Why'd you hire me then?
I didn't think I was up to it.
After you missed him at the apartment,
I figured I should get involved,
before he came gunning for me.
He didn't even know about you.
I figured that out when he didn't
finish me off at the hospital.
His brother's girlfriend
was my informant down in L.A.
She told me about the bank job.
Hired some more of my
informants down there.
and they helped me
take down their score.
So, what now?
Now?
I ride off into the sunset.
Hey!
I forgot to pay you.
You know, I don't get you.
Why do you put yourself through
all this shit for one lousy dollar?
It's my price. Call it a hobby.
You know what, keep it.
I didn't earn it.
Don't contact me again, I'm done.
Yeah, me too.
<i>Detective Cicero?</i>
Yeah, I can't reach him.
<i>Okay, well, hopefully he'll turn up.</i>
We've got units en route.
<i>We'll see you shortly.</i>
Wait a minute.
You didn't flip him this case, did you?
No, I didn't flip him the case.
<i>Is that what you thought?</i>
He asked for it, right?
He begged for it.
<i>And I felt sorry for him, so I caved.</i>
Is there a reason why we're
talking about this right now?
- No. No reason.
- Okay, I'll see you shortly.
"Go with the flow", my ass.
Marina? Hey, it's me, honey.
Well, I got him, I closed the case.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
As a matter of fact, I feel perfect.
- Better than I ever have.
- <i>Yeah?</i>
Yeah. And I'm gonna get rid
of the other stuff too.
Don't you worry, I promise.
I'll be home in a couple hours.
Listen, you're not gonna believe this.
I've been reading up on women,
and I think I got you figured out.
We're gonna be fine.
Yeah, honey, it's over.
I wanna start brand-new, honey.
How?
Metal plate.
I can't feel anything.
I created my own hell.
And I'm the demon who crawled up out of it.
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Baby.</i>
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm coming home.</i>
