Hey!
Listen. I'm gonna take off.
Do you mind locking the
door on your way out?
You aren't gonna buy
me breakfast, are you?
No.
You are officially
banned after last night.
I mean, literally, I can't
even remember last night.
You were up on stage.
- No.
- Yeah.
You gave a Russian guy a lap dance,
- and he was not into it.
- What?
Like, really not into it.
- Hey, how are you?
- Pretty good.
I will take a double Grey
Goose on the rocks, please.
What are you paying with?
There you go.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey.
- Hey!
- How you doing?
- I'm good, Mr. Vincent.
How are you? I was
gonna call you today.
Hi.
I was hoping I'd find thirty-seven
grand in there for me.
I do all my banking
online these days.
Listen, kid, I just
learned something
that kind of hurt my feelings.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
According to a friend
of mine down south,
your family has more money than
they know what to do with.
Well, my family and I,
we have parted ways.
That's why I borrow money from you.
Card's declined.
Listen to me.
I know where you work.
I know where you live.
I know where you gamble
away money you don't have.
I know where you go for probation.
I know the whole thing.
And if I don't have my
money by Friday 5:00,
I will find you, and I will
smash your head wide open.
I have no problem doing that.
Mr. Wheeler has
continued to exhibit,
through a series of offenses...
DUI, resisting arrest,
criminal speeding, participation
in unlicensed gaming,
and now aggravated assault...
that he is combative, disruptive,
and has a general disregard for
simple rules and regulations.
He also seems incapable
of obeying the law.
Whoever wrote that just...
just gets me.
That guy and his thick-neck
buddy showed up again.
Said you weren't here.
All right. Thank you.
Hey, don't you have somebody
tied up in your basement
you need to go torture,
something like that?
Hey, man, you got no
money socked away?
Does it look like I got
any money socked away?
What about your family?
You said your brother's getting
married next week, right?
- Yeah, I did. So what?
- So what?
So, get a tux and fly to the party.
Everybody's happy and your old
man's checkbook's already open.
Yeah.
I think I can make it
to the wedding now.
Oh, that's great.
Here. Talk to your father.
No, Mom. Mom, I don't... Mom!
Hello?
Hey, Dad.
Oh, Jay. How are you?
I'm well.
I've been following the
merger talks in the news.
Looks promising.
Yeah.
How's the plan going out there?
It's going very well.
It's going amazing, actually.
I was telling Mom I got a new job.
It's an administration position
with one of the largest
psychiatric hospitals out here.
Oh, really?
I've met someone, too,
and she's beautiful.
She's just the greatest thing.
Mom would love her.
Does she take her clothes
off for a living?
No, she doesn't take her
clothes off for a living, Dad.
She's a nurse.
You should bring her
to the wedding.
Bring her to the wedding?
Yeah, sure.
No, she's not gonna be able
to get the time off work.
She's a nut with the work.
We both think you should bring her.
Okay, you know what?
We'll be there.
Tell Mom we're gonna be there
and we'll be there, okay?
Okay.
Shit.
<i>Would a med tech please
report to physical therapy?</i>
Mop guy, show us what you got.
My God, you look...
you look amazing today.
I wear this every day.
Really? I don't know.
Today, it's really working.
You're single, right?
Yes, I'm single.
I'm single, too. This is great.
You're single because
you're an asshole.
Yeah, but an interesting
and fun asshole.
I'm gonna cut right to it.
My brother's getting married
in New Orleans this weekend,
and I was kind of thinking if
you weren't busy or anything,
- you and me...
- You're serious.
Is that a yes?
This is Daisy Kensington.
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.
Okay, fellas. Break time.
I'm only here because
I refuse to vote.
I know.
Because I refuse to use credit
cards or go on the internet.
They know my record.
They know your record, too,
Mr. Wheeler, if that's your real name.
They know everything about you.
I am off the grid, baby!
Just because I won't
go to websites,
just because I don't have a cell phone,
I won't even look at a television.
- That's why, that's why.
- You don't have to.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Mr. B., how's the wild man today?
Yeah. She's nice.
Pretty women, Mr. B.
You remember pretty women?
Yeah.
Bertleman wants to see
you in his office.
Listen, I don't know
what Frakel told you.
You're giving alcohol and
pornography to my patients.
They're my friends.
They are, variously,
psychotic, catatonic,
manic, and delusional.
They are also my responsibility.
From this point forward,
you will have no contact
with these patients
except to mop the floor
beneath their feet.
Are we clear?
We're clear. Absolutely.
I'm fully aware that
if you lose this job,
you violate your probation.
If you let that happen,
you will find yourself downwind
from a Category-S shit storm.
- Can I...
- I'm done.
Okay.
It's Miss Daisy Kensington, right?
Miss Kensington, do you
know where you are?
It's okay.
This is a psychiatric hospital.
The police report says that
your mother passed away
and you left a note for the mailman
asking him what you should do.
Miss Kensington,
are you aware of the time?
Do you know the day, month, year?
I'm not exactly sure
what day it is.
It's okay.
Do you know why you're here?
I guess...
The voices.
We're gonna do some tests.
But I'm supposed to be sleeping.
I know. It won't take long.
Are you a doctor?
Yeah, I'm your special doctor.
Wait.
Stop. Please.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
It's okay.
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
You didn't do anything wrong.
The guy's a freak.
- He was gonna hurt you.
- But he's a doctor.
No, he's not a doctor.
Listen to me. You got to
protect yourself in here.
You're the mopping man.
Yeah, I'm Jay.
Where's your mop?
Doesn't matter. I got to get out
of here. You gonna be okay?
Mrs. Nealberry,
go back to bed, please.
It's time to get up.
- No, baby. It's time to sleep.
- It's time to sleep.
Hey. Be careful.
It's time to get up.
Wash your face, wash your hands.
Shit.
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
You can't leave. You're a patient.
I don't like it here.
I get that. But you
can't just stand here.
Where should I stand?
Come on, come on.
Where are your shoes?
I don't have any.
How come you don't have shoes?
They hurt my feet.
Look. You got to go back inside. You
got to tell them what happened, okay?
Please?
What's wrong?
What's happening?
Okay. Just breathe.
Look at me.
Just breathe. Breathe, okay?
I really don't care if you
don't want to go back.
You can do whatever you want, okay?
Grab a cab.
Call somebody. Do something, okay?
- Who should I call?
- I don't know.
You're supposed to know
the people you know.
Take care of yourself.
Get some shoes.
What is this place?
- It's a club.
- What kind of club?
It's a dancing club.
- For people who like to dance?
- Yeah, for people who like to dance.
Why is it so dark?
It's a club for people who
like dancing in the dark.
That lady didn't
have any clothes on!
Did she? I didn't even notice.
A lot of people in here
don't have clothes on.
Okay. Take a seat.
I'm gonna go talk to some people.
Just don't move, okay?
You, me, New Orleans.
I don't know.
Pretending to be a nurse
makes me uncomfortable.
You hump a pole naked for money,
but this makes you uncomfortable?
You don't see the irony there?
Does anybody want to go to
Jay's brother's wedding?
No.
Come on, you guys. I need a date.
And why should we help you?
Because I'm putting
you through college
with all those dollars I
drop in your panties?
What's in it for us?
The fuzzy feeling you
get helping a friend?
Why are you wearing those shoes?
She dances beautifully!
You might want to come
check on your friend.
Yo, sweets, you got to get out.
But Jay said that this
was a dancing club.
Jay who?
Jay. He snuck us in the back.
He said that he didn't want
the bouncer to see us.
You got to get down. Come on.
What? No, no.
You need to leave now!
Okay, take it easy. We're going.
You all right?
Okay. We're going. We're going.
Come on.
You all right?
This fat man offered me
$100 for a hand job.
I've never had a job.
You sure you have no
one you can call?
You have no friends?
You have no family?
You have nobody?
What am I supposed to do with you?
Do you have I.D.?
You got to show I.D. at security.
I have it. It's in here.
What's happening? What's wrong?
I don't know what to do.
That's okay. I have a plan,
and it's a good one.
All you have to do is smile
and eat yummy snacks.
And when people say,
"Hey, what do you do?"
you say, "I'm a nurse. "
I'm not supposed to lie.
It's not a lie.
It's pretending, which is fine.
What's the difference?
I'll explain it to you later.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Your dancer friends really don't
mind I borrowed their clothes?
No. They wanted to help.
Are you sure this looks okay?
Yeah. You look fantastic.
Really, you look great.
Just keep the sweater on.
- This?
- Yeah.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry. Hi.
Your friend's been in the
bathroom for a really long time.
Daisy, it's me. It's Jay.
There's no flusher.
She's a first-time flyer.
There is, honey. It's just a
little different than usual.
You see the button in the
wall above the seat?
It's actually a lever.
Yeah, push that.
It says "flush" right on it.
But the letters are worn off.
Anyway, just push it.
It was really loud.
You handled it well, though.
Let's try and get some sleep, okay?
I'm not sleepy.
Then eat your peanuts.
I already did.
Then eat mine.
I already did.
This flight's called a red eye.
Do you know why?
Because if we don't get sleep,
we're gonna have red eyes
when we get to New Orleans.
And you don't want red eyes when
you meet my family, do you?
No.
So, let's be quiet.
I'm sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We have another problem.
Let's go, hon. You can't sit here.
But the seats are too
small back there.
I know, but we didn't
pay for the big seats.
Can we pay for them now?
- No, we can't pay for them now.
- What's wrong with her?
Excuse me. There's nothing
wrong with my girlfriend.
Thank you.
Let's go, hon.
I'm lonely back there.
Do we have to sleep?
No, we don't have to sleep.
Can we get some of those
good nuts in the nice dish?
Take mine.
I already did.
Everyone's moving around.
We're getting ready to land.
Before...
you called me your girlfriend.
Am I really your girlfriend?
Yeah, you're my girlfriend.
My mother told me I would never
be anybody's girlfriend.
I guess she was wrong, then.
I think I'm just
gonna stay out here.
You'll be okay.
So, let's move Consuela
to the family table
because the wedding party
will be somewhere else.
Hey, Mom.
You're really here.
- Mom, this is Daisy.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
Oh, my. What a cute skirt.
Oh, you have no shoes on.
Oh, God, Mom.
We are really beat.
Of course. Look at me.
I'll have Mary bring
up your things.
We don't really have any things.
Your luggage?
Yeah, we traveled light.
- I can always pick you up a suit.
- Great.
And remember, this is the South,
so you'll have two rooms.
I wouldn't stay in the
same room with a man.
Yeah, we haven't... We aren't...
You'll be sleeping in
Marie Antoinette's bed.
Oh, no. That's okay.
She can have it.
I'll just sleep on the floor.
You are so funny.
No, darling.
Jay will have his room and you
can stay in the guest room.
I thought you quit.
I did.
We haven't heard from
you in a long time.
When am I gonna meet this
new girlfriend of yours?
At dinner.
Your mother says she's
very beautiful.
She is.
She's very beautiful.
She's got me rethinking my future.
Come on. I want to
show you something.
Wow!
It's the American
dream on four wheels.
It's even got a china cabinet.
China cabinet? Really?
There's only two others in decent
condition in the whole country.
And I practically stole it.
Hey, it's good to be king.
You're damn right it is.
Time for a drink.
Mom said you were coming,
but I didn't believe it.
I'm here. How you doing?
- Good. I'll grab Kate.
- Okay.
I don't suppose
you're on the wagon.
No, not unless there's booze on it.
- Well, to Jerry.
- To Jerry.
So, where is this girl?
She's coming down in a bit.
She's a bit shy.
Here she is.
I'm a nurse.
Well, that's great
because I'm actually coming
down with something.
Dad, this is Daisy.
Oh, call me Jason.
This is my son Jerry, the groom.
And this is...
Kate. I've heard so
much about you, Jay.
- Well, it's all true.
- I'm Daisy.
I'm a nurse.
Well, thank y'all
so much for coming.
It was such a surprise.
Jerry said you met at a hospital.
We did. It's a great story.
We met at a hospital
where I'm a nurse.
I think they got that part, hon.
Did you tell them about the
part where you saved me
from a doctor who
wasn't really a doctor?
Oh, God. Never date a doctor.
- They're so emotionally remote.
- You dated a doctor?
No, I read an article about it.
God, you're so skinny!
I can see your bones.
Thank you.
You okay?
Good.
Oh, my God.
That's like drinking perfume.
Well, that's pretty
much what it costs.
Have all you want, darling.
I'd like to make a toast...
to Jerry and Kate.
Kate, we are so proud and grateful
to welcome you as a
member of the family.
And I just want to wish you both
all of the happiness
that money cannot buy.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
- To Jerry and Kate.
There you go.
I can't eat this.
Why not?
I think it's Fancy Feast.
- That's cat food.
- No, I got that.
I got that. I know what you meant.
Are you gonna eat it?
Actually, it's Jerry's favorite.
Not really.
They force-feed the goose
so its liver distends.
I saw a documentary
about it. I literally cried.
Okay, that's it.
Bring in the goddamn salads!
So, tell us about this
new job of yours.
It's nothing glamorous.
Just hospital administration.
Well, at least you're
not mopping floors.
Actually, Dad, I'm looking into
some new business ventures.
Really, Jay? That's wonderful.
Really? What kind of ventures?
Sports and entertainment,
mostly, new gaming applications.
What does that mean?
I'm interested in a little start-up
that has an app for placing
bets in real time.
Gambling.
Well, so much for your MBA.
Capitalism is based on
gambling, isn't it, Dad?
It sounds interesting.
He's also involved in a dance club.
You invested in a club?
I don't want to bore
everyone with that.
But at some point, Dad,
I would like to sit down
and talk more about this.
- So, you came back for money.
- No, I didn't come back for money.
I came back to see my
little brother get married.
But you're the one that taught me to
always be looking for new opportunities.
You had every opportunity
in the world
when you were here, except
for you decided to...
I also taught you to have a plan.
He actually does
have a plan, Jason,
and it's a very good one.
We just can't talk
about it right now.
You're a part of this?
Yes.
Well, then, let's
talk about it later.
Yes, let's.
I've never had champagne before.
Yeah, I kind of figured that.
You did great, by the way.
Everyone really liked you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they did.
I'll see you in the morning.
Honey?
She's cleaning the bathroom.
- Who?
- Daisy.
So?
She's cleaning our bathroom.
Hey, there.
Where'd you get those?
In this box in the
closet marked "Jay. "
Why are you cleaning the bathroom?
I clean. That's what I do.
I did all the cooking and
the cleaning for my mother.
Hey, give me that.
Listen.
You don't have to do
any of that here.
My mother said that this
is how you earn love.
I thought you didn't
have any family.
I don't.
She's dead.
I'm sorry, but your
mother didn't know
what the hell she
was talking about.
You just love people
'cause you love them,
and that's it.
What?
My mother is dead...
because I killed her.
I killed her.
That's why they put
me in the hospital.
Oh, my.
It doesn't really cover up
everything that it's supposed to.
Well, it's barely a dress at all.
Jay borrowed it from a stripper.
You're probably not
joking, are you?
Come.
I've kept every dress
I've ever worn
knowing they would come
in handy some day.
You're gorgeous.
Can we play a little bit?
I think this one would be
very pretty with your skin.
Sorry to keep you waiting, boys.
We needed a little extra girl time.
Wow.
Here.
You're dropping them.
That's the point.
No, come on.
Sit.
Continue. Continue on.
We're gonna sit, we're gonna watch,
and we're gonna clap
when it's over.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I've been thinking about
what you said last night.
What did I say?
You know, I don't take any pleasure
in watching you struggle.
I am not struggling, Dad.
Throwing money at a start-up
is like throwing
darts at a mosquito.
You think the guys at Mac
and Amazon feel that way?
For every one of
those breakthroughs,
there's a thousand failures.
Everybody thinks he's gonna
be the exception to the rule.
Dad, I've done my research.
This company I'm talking about
has got sound fundamentals,
it's well capitalized, and
it's got an excellent board.
How much are you looking for?
Thirty-five to forty grand
will get us in the door.
More photos.
So, how long have
you been with Jay?
Three days.
And he's brought you
home to meet the family?
We have a plan.
Impressive.
We had a little thing eons ago.
Oh, my God. So did we.
Just a little advice.
He gets a stiffy for every
pretty girl he sees.
And what do you do, dear?
- I'm a nurse.
- A nurse!
Lou, show her that
thing on your back.
Such lovely families.
I'd love to have their
combined net worth.
You can tell Wheeler's
still pissed off
about that Hoffman scandal.
I think it is a shame
about his older boy.
Still, the pair of
balls that kid had.
While Wheeler's closing
the deal with Hoffman,
the kid is upstairs
screwing the wife.
You can't make that stuff up.
Thank you.
I've been looking all over for you.
Can we dance now?
You want to dance?
Let's dance.
Where did you learn how to do that?
VH1.
It's okay. Relax.
You can grab hold of me anytime.
I've never grabbed anyone before.
I've never even danced with anyone.
What about school
dances growing up?
I didn't go to school.
Are you kidding?
I don't think I'm kidding.
That's why no one
can understand me.
What about me?
I don't think they
understand you, either.
May I borrow him?
A mother doesn't get many chances.
May I?
Well, I got to hand it to Jay.
You're just... not what I expected.
Where did you guys meet?
The hospital.
Daisy, Jay wouldn't be
working at a hospital
unless there was a catch.
- Catch?
- Yes, a catch.
And you know the catch.
I do?
Yeah.
I can't help him unless
I know the truth.
What's he really doing in L.A.?
I'm not lying.
I just want the truth, Daisy.
I can't talk anymore.
Daisy, who are you?
What's happening?
Somethings wrong with her.
It's okay. She's fine.
She's not fine.
She's fine. She's had
too much champagne.
- She needs some air.
- Let's get her outside.
I got it. Go back to your dance.
You need to get her to a doctor.
- She's fine, Dad.
- Jay, look at her.
If you don't take her, we will.
Who is she, Jay?
It's not what you think, Dad.
Leave it alone.
It's obviously much
worse than I think.
Honey, what is it?
I'm a janitor in a mental hospital.
It's part of my probation.
She's a patient.
- That's perfect.
- Yeah, it's perfect.
You okay?
This belongs to you.
You keep it, honey.
You keep it.
Keep it?
I gave that necklace to you!
Jason, I want her to have it.
But I gave it to you.
It was an anniversary gift.
It doesn't matter!
Leave it alone, Dad!
Leave it alone!
Stop!
Take it, Mom.
Oh, good.
Are we done with the plan now?
Yeah, we're done.
There's got to be
keys in one of these.
Why can't we just fly
back on the plane?
Because I violated my probation,
and you're an escaped
mental patient.
- Is that bad?
- Yeah, that's bad.
I'm sure they're gonna be
looking for us by now.
What about this big shiny one?
Come on.
God damn it.
Yes.
Look! These stick to the wall!
Oh, my God.
There's no water in the toilet.
What?
Stay here. I got to
make a phone call.
Here.
I don't need any money.
There's some vending
machines over there.
Take it.
Take it.
It's not gonna be long?
No, it's not gonna be too long.
I'm telling you.
She is a classic, okay?
She really belongs in a museum.
What's the catch?
I can't remember where
I put the title.
Excuse me, Miss,
but is there something
I can help you with?
My boyfriend is just
making a phone call,
so it shouldn't be long.
How come you got no shoes?
There's a rule here in the station.
You got to have shoes.
It's not like I'm gonna
turn you in or anything.
I was just worried maybe
your feet might get cold.
<i>Last call for the H40
to New Orleans.</i>
Are you sure you're okay, baby?
I'll be right over there.
If you need any help,
let me know, okay?
Wheeler, where are you?
I'd say somewhere between
screwed and totally fucked.
Yeah, no kidding. Mr. Frakel...
Frakel's an evil liar.
I saved her from him.
Just ask Mrs. Nealberry.
Mrs. Nealberry thinks
she's in planetary orbit
and that I am from Alpha Centauri.
Now, tell me where
Miss Kensington is
before you make this
worse for yourself.
She's okay. She's safe. She's fine.
She is not fine.
She is quite possibly
psychotic or schizophrenic.
I don't know, Doc.
I haven't seen her talking to anyone
who's not there or anything like that.
Listen to me, Wheeler.
This girl has spent
virtually her entire life
locked inside the house.
Her social awareness,
her ability to cope
are almost certainly
severely impaired.
Besides the occasional panic attack
and not liking shoes, I think
she's highly functional.
I'm actually thinking it's a
little post-traumatic stress.
Are you kidding me?
You are not a doctor!
She's at the Greyhound bus
station in Shreveport, okay?
That's in Louisiana.
Wheeler, you can't...
God damn it!
Can you help me get home?
Oh, baby, well, that depends
upon where home is.
Where do you want to go?
No more phone calls?
No more phone calls.
You go inside and get a few things. I'm
gonna be outside having a smoke. Here.
Take this.
There you go.
And... take some money.
Go ahead. Get whatever you want.
Go on.
There you go.
Nine items or less.
I don't understand.
You can only have nine items.
But I need all of this.
Then you're in the wrong line.
We got to go. Come on.
My mother never let me go shopping.
I can cook, but I just don't
know how to pick things.
I was really excited about
those powdered doughnuts!
Hey!
I think that police
officer is talking to us.
I get that. Thank you.
- There's a thing.
- Yep. Got it.
Everything's fine.
I think that police
officer's following us.
Yeah, thank you. I see that.
He's still following!
He's getting closer.
I see. Thank you.
He's even closer!
Hold on to something!
We lost him!
Oh, shit.
You're gonna have to
drive for a while.
I don't know how to drive.
Right.
My mom said that driving
gets you pregnant.
Your mother told you a lot of
crazy-ass shit, didn't she?
Sorry.
My mom did tell me a
lot of crazy-ass shit.
But she let me watch TV.
But just "TV Land"
and CMT, stuff like that.
She didn't like any of
the other channels.
If you never went to school, how'd
you learn to read and stuff?
She taught me.
That was mostly so we could play
Scrabble 'cause she loved it.
Except you had to let her win.
Always let her win.
If I'm gonna drive solo,
I got to sleep for a few hours.
But just a few hours, then
you got to wake me up, okay?
Okay. I can do that.
What? Hi. What?
You make funny noises
when you sleep.
Really?
Kind of like...
And there's a cop outside.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I did right now. You're up.
- Are we in trouble?
- No, I'm in trouble.
That guy's gonna throw
my sorry ass in jail.
Maybe we can ask him not to.
What?
Fuck.
My boyfriend ran that way
when he saw your lights
'cause he thinks you're gonna
throw his sorry ass in jail.
All right, ma'am.
I need you to step
out of the vehicle.
Actually, I think I'd
rather stay inside.
Ma'am?
There's no water in the
toilet, so we can't flush.
Lord, have mercy.
What's your boyfriend's name?
- His name?
- Yeah, his name.
Beaver.
Did you say Beaver?
Beaver.
Beaver was my daddy's name.
Really?
Get back in the vehicle.
He went out in the woods
to go look for you.
I'll be right back.
- What did you do?
- I threw his keys away.
Why?
'Cause if you go to jail,
we can't be together.
You are hardcore.
- I am?
- Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
I'm so hungry.
Me, too.
And I have to go big potty.
You're not getting cold, are you?
- Hi.
- Hey, there.
- How are you?
- Come on over.
- I'm Dave Walachowski.
- I'm Jay.
My girlfriend, Daisy.
Our bathroom is broken.
You want to use ours?
Go ahead.
Then come on and
join us by the fire.
So, where you headed, Jay?
- Los Angeles.
- So are we!
We're going to Hollywood
to see Howie Mandel.
Deal or no deal?
Deal... or no deal?
Deal?
God, I love that show.
Plus, we're gonna
get to see her mom.
She has dementia.
Time to put this one to bed.
She's such an angel.
When she's asleep.
The moment she wakes
up, she's the devil.
You'll have one someday
and you'll see.
All right, lovie.
We should probably hit the
sack. It's getting late.
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
Appreciate it.
Hey.
You've been thinking about
having sex with me, haven't you?
It's okay.
I'm a virgin.
I thought so.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah, sure.
Did you really have sex
with somebody's wife?
Who told you about that?
Some people at the wedding.
He said something about
your balls, too.
Did you have sex with
somebody's wife?
Yeah, I did.
Is that why your dad
is so mad at you?
He's got so many reasons.
But, yeah.
Who was she?
She was the wife of a man
who could have made my
family a lot of money.
She also happened to
be very beautiful
and very lonely.
Did you love her?
You know you're the only one
that's ever asked me that?
I don't know.
Basic human emotions are
not my strong suit.
Good night.
This is...
the best day of my life.
Do we have to go back?
Can't we just go somewhere else?
I'm in a lot of trouble, Daisy.
That's why we shouldn't go back.
I owe some people a lot of money.
If I had any money,
I'd give it to you.
I'm gonna teach you how to drive.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Let's recap.
To start, brake, jiggle gas, go.
That's easy, right?
- No, that's hard.
- You'll be fine.
Now drive us to the
other end of the lot.
No.
Daisy, it's okay. I'm right here.
Start, brake, jiggle gas, go.
You can do this.
I can't.
I can't do things
like other people.
What do you think you've been
doing the last few days?
Things.
- It's only because I've been with you.
- No, it's not.
You followed me out
of the hospital.
You flew in a plane.
You danced at a wedding.
You even outsmarted
a state trooper.
He wasn't very smart.
No, he wasn't very
smart, but still.
Daisy, you can do anything
in the world... anything.
You just have to want to.
Where is she?
- It's okay. I'm bringing her back.
- Son, do you realize what you've done?
I haven't done anything.
She followed me out of the
hospital like a lost puppy.
What was I supposed to do with her?
Contact a mental
health professional.
Didn't occur to me.
At this point, I'm almost
more concerned about you.
You're facing serious charges now.
You know they can find you.
Doc, don't worry about that.
I'm gonna bring her back to you.
I promise I'm gonna bring her back.
You said no more phone calls.
Daisy.
Wheeler, what's happening?
Daisy! Brake for slow!
Hit the one on the left
and stop and talk to me!
You got to brake for
slow, remember?
Brake for slow!
You never wanted to
be my boyfriend!
It was all just pretend!
Yes, I did! Of course I did!
Daisy, please!
You're driving in circles!
Literally in circles!
Daisy, stop!
You're driving like a crazy person!
I'm not a crazy person!
Stop!
It's all right.
You okay?
It's okay.
We got to get out of here.
We don't have the money
to pay for this.
Can I ask you something?
Did you kill your mother?
Yes.
Were there voices?
Did voices tell you to do it?
No.
The voices... they
didn't tell me things.
They told my mother things.
So, you don't hear voices.
Your mother did.
Yeah.
They used to tell her
things all the time.
And sometimes it was
just silly stuff, but...
mostly it was scary.
That's why she yelled all the time.
But...
one night, she...
she just screamed
and screamed and...
I didn't go to her.
And then when I woke up in
the morning, she was dead.
Daisy, that is not you
killing your mother.
That is her dying.
You need to stop saying you killed
your mother because you didn't.
You didn't kill her.
You didn't kill her.
Why do I have to go back
to the hospital then?
I never wanted to take you back.
That's not real though, is it?
That's just pretend.
It is.
I did want to take you back.
I did.
But now I don't.
I really don't.
Am I gonna have to
live at the hospital?
I don't know.
No one's gonna know where I am.
I'll know.
- You're not gonna forget?
- I'm not gonna forget.
Daisy?
Hey, Daisy?
Hey, Daisy? What happened?
Daisy, it's me, Mary Beth.
Mary Beth Nealberry, honey.
He's in the Los
Angeles County jail.
Jason...
there was a time when you
were as reckless as he is,
and who bailed you out?
Your father.
Who posted my bail?
- I'm sorry.
- I got to see her, man.
I just don't see it happening.
Mr. Wheeler, you
have a better chance
of being elected mayor than
ever getting in here again...
which is to say none.
Hey, what are you doing?
Get off the tracks!
How we feeling today?
I don't want any more pills.
I just want to see Jay.
You can't, honey. He's in jail.
No, he was here this morning.
Either way, he doesn't
work here anymore.
I have to go then.
No. No, Daisy.
I promise I'm only gonna
leave for a little bit.
You can't.
It's okay 'cause I'm
not crazy. It's okay.
It's all right. You
just need to calm down.
No, I'm not having an attack!
I just want to see my boyfriend!
Well, that was quite a stunt.
- But I'm releasing you.
- You can't. I'm suicidal.
- Bullshit.
- I'm serious.
Then I'll put you on
suicide precaution.
You'll be in a locked ward.
She's not sick, Doc.
The voices are not in Daisy's head.
They were in her mother's head.
She told you that?
Dr. Bertleman?
Yes, Mr. Phelpmitter?
Why won't you let Mr.
Wheeler see his Daisy?
Mr. Phelpmitter, I can't discuss
another patient with you.
They're holding her against
her will, aren't they?
They've got a computer with
everything about you on it.
They know about you and Daisy.
They know everything.
Oh, look. Beautiful.
What you got? Come on.
Where the hell you been?
You okay?
For once in your life, don't talk.
That's talking.
Sorry.
I came to apologize.
For what?
You were right about Frakel.
And about Daisy's mother.
She was diagnosed schizophrenic
with extreme paranoia
by several doctors.
It's remarkable she was able
to raise a daughter at all.
So, you can release her?
I need to keep an eye on her.
If all goes well,
she'll transition to a group
home in two or three months.
No, that's too long to wait.
She'll be all right.
I wasn't talking about her.
Well, there's nothing I can do.
Of course there is.
So, you wanted to know
about Mr. Wheeler.
You like Mr. Wheeler?
I don't like him. I love him.
Have you ever been in
love before, Daisy?
Then how do you know
you love Mr. Wheeler?
Have you ever been in love?
I'd like to think so, yes.
With who?
I was married.
And we're divorced now.
You still love her.
When it happens...
you know it's not anything else.
Thank you.
They're from planet Nebulon.
They're beautiful.
I know you can hear me.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
You're standing on my toes.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
Let's go.
Okay.
