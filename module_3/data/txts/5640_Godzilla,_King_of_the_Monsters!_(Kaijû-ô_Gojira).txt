<i>What has happened here</i>

<i>which, up until a few days ago,</i>
<i>was entirely...</i>
<i>beyond the scope</i>

<i>Tokyo - a smoldering memorial</i>

<i>My name is Steve Martin.</i>
<i>I'm a foreign correspondent</i>

<i>I was headed</i>
<i>for an assignment in Cairo...</i>
<i>when I stopped off in Tokyo</i>

<i>But it turned out to be a visit</i>
<i>to the living hell of another world.</i>
<i>Emergency hospitals were overflowing</i>

<i>For the living,</i>

<i>[ Steve Narrating ] This morning,</i>

- Pardon. You are Mr. Steve Martin?
- Yes.
I'm Shigeo Ioto,

Oh, how do you do?
And how is Serizawa?
His health is fine, but he regrets
not being here to meet you.
Something wrong?
Dr. Serizawa had to go inland
on some field experiments.
He wanted to delay them
until after your visit...
but they were much too important.
- He hopes that you understand.
- Of course.
- Oh, when's he planning to return?
- Perhaps before your departure to Cairo.
Meanwhile, if there's anything I can do,

I'm sorry, Mr. Martin,

a ship from Tokyo was literally wiped...
from the surface of the ocean
in a matter of seconds.
Anything from the ship's radio?
It said there was
a blinding flash of light...
and the ocean burst into flame.
Could have been
a mine or a collision.
Why would the radio men
not report a mine or a collision?
That's a good point.

<i>[ Steve Narrating ] Like a creeping illness,</i>

<i>[ Steve Narrating ]</i>

[ Crowd Clamoring ]
[ Japanese ]
<i>With disaster following disaster,</i>
<i>the terror-stricken people...</i>
<i>demanded action be taken.</i>
<i>Security officials and scientists</i>
<i>were called together.</i>
<i>Dr. Yamane,</i>
<i>Japan's leading paleontologist...</i>

<i>I had met Dr. Yamane through my friend</i>

<i>[ Man Speaking Japanese ]</i>

I'm afraid my Japanese

[ Japanese ]
Dr. Yamane is suggesting
to the officials...
that they question
the natives of a small island.
He says that Odo Island
is close to the area...
where the disasters
have taken place.
<i>[ Steve Narrating ]</i>
<i>Odo Island...</i>
<i>a bleak spot of land in the Pacific...</i>
<i>populated</i>
<i>with several hundred natives...</i>
<i>who were now</i>
<i>half paralyzed with fear.</i>

<i>[ Steve Narrating ] The next morning,</i>

<i>Tomo and I went out</i>

[ Japanese ]
Hey, Tomo, we make him mad?
He's frightened.
He's terribly frightened.
He must've seen something.
He claimed he saw a monster,
a horrible monster.
If he saw a monster,
he's had too much sake.
No, no, Mr. Martin.
These island people are very superstitious.
Well, let's see what else
we can find out.
<i>[ Steve Narrating ]</i>
<i>It was decided that we'd spend the night...</i>
<i>and it gave me an opportunity</i>
<i>to witness a rare ceremony...</i>
<i>one that was all but forgotten.</i>
<i>dd [ Native ]</i>
The island people are beset
by many dangers, Steve -
some real, some imagined.
<i>This ceremony is dedicated</i>
<i>to one such danger.</i>
<i>There's a legend</i>
<i>among the island people...</i>
<i>that somewhere off their shores</i>
<i>there exists a monster...</i>
too terrible
for a mortal to conceive.
Many centuries ago, they used
to send a young girl out on a raft...
each year as a sacrifice.
<i>dd [ Continues ]</i>
What's the name of this monster?
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Godzilla. Godzilla!</i>
[ Japanese ]

is responsible
for all these ship disasters?

<i>The next morning, the officials brought</i>

[ Chattering In Japanese ]
[ Japanese ]
<i>Each of the natives of Odo Island...</i>
<i>told his own story</i>

<i>[ Japanese Continues ]</i>
[ Japanese ]
I have not been
to the island myself...
but the world today is filled
with many mysteries.
In the Himalayas, footprints
of snowmen have been found.

<i>Is it not possible that some other</i>

organized to make...
a scientific survey of Odo Island.
[ People Applauding ]
I'm going to catch Dr. Yamane.
I'll see you later.
It seems to me there are still
forces left in this world...
that none of us can understand.

You take this monster talk seriously?

It can safely be assumed
that two million years ago...
this brontosaurus and other
ancient reptiles roamed the earth.
<i>It was known as the Jurassic age.</i>
During this period,
<i>there was another species which</i>
<i>we may call the intermediary animal...</i>
<i>a cross between the land-living</i>
<i>and the sea-living animals.</i>
Let us call this creature Godzilla...
<i>according to the legend</i>
<i>of Odo Island.</i>
And judging from this photograph...
this creature is over 400 feet tall.
[ All Murmuring ]

Of course,
the question we are...

<i>happened to reappear</i>
<i>after all these centuries...</i>

rare phenomenon of nature...
allowed this breed
of the Jurassic age to reproduce itself...
<i>and for a long span of time, it had</i>
<i>no reason to reappear to the world.</i>
<i>But now that analysis</i>
<i>of radioactivity...</i>
<i>of the creature's footprint...</i>
