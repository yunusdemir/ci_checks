* I'm moving ahead *
* Constantly driven *
* My heart's torn deep *
* I feel so tormented *
* To see familiar eyes *
* In a picture,
my brother’s eyes *
* My brother’s eyes *
* Will I be broken,
will I heal with time? *
* Where will I be when
when the last man dies? *
* When the last man dies. *
* Suns will set
and suns will rise *
* But I still see
my brother's eyes *
* Suns will set
and suns will rise *
* But I still see
my brother's eyes *
* Suns will set
and suns will rise *
* But I still see
my brother's eyes *
* I'm moving ahead *
* Constantly driven *
* To see familiar eyes *
* In a picture *
* My brother's eyes *
* My brother's eyes *
* My brother's eyes *
* My brother's eyes. *
Man: I'm trying, guys.
Just not making it easy.
Boy: Would you relax?
Girl: Don't worry.
He's amazing.
You have to meet him.
Just chill out!
What makes this guy
so great, Joe?
Just wait here.
Mr. Sloan?
Would you come on!
Girl: Hey,
Mr. Sloan!
Hey, Joe. Don't you guys
have school today?
Summer vacation started yesterday.
This here's Tommy.
How you doing, Tommy?
Doesn't look like
a champion to me.
Come on!
Are you new in town, Tommy?
No, he just got out
of "juvie".
And he can’t talk
for himself?
Nah, he's too bad
to talk.
I told him about that thing
you do with your eyes closed.
Oh, the rock and the river?
Yeah, that's it.
Later, Joe.
Chickenshit.
I'll tell you what, Tommy.
You take your best shot.
Hah.
Ughh!
You know, Tommy,
sometimes when you're blind,
and times seem darkest,
you often see things
more clearly.
Come by the gym sometime.
I'll show you how it's done.
He looks like
a champion to me.
You didn't put that tape
on too tight
like you used to do
all the time, did you?
Shut up!
Electric notice.
Second time.
So pay it.
With what?
Come on, will ya, Jack?
We gotta talk, David.
Students: Sh-hh.
Be quiet.
The most dangerous
weapon in the universe
is a focused mind.
You're mind should be like
a still, calm pool.
Tranquil. Relaxed.
One violent emotion
is like taking a rock
and dropping it into
that smooth pond.
Everything’s chaos.
Concentration is lost.
Brian is going to show
us how to lose
with dignity and grace.
- You ready?
- Any time, old man.
See, he's trying to throw
a rock into my pond.
Knockdown ends the lesson.
Students:
Yeah.
Student: Come on.
Go man, go!
Not even close.
Students: Ooh!
Rock hit the pond.
What are you doing?
I told you...
knockdown ends the lesson.
That was a slip!
Had it been a real fight,
I'd have won.
But what do you know
about real fights?
Lesson's over.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I just want to be
as good as you.
It's all right.
You're going to be better.
You're a hell of a fighter.
A hell of a fighter.
And David Sloan...
the last of the great
Sloan Dynasty.
I saw your exhibition
this summer.
It was sublime,
a religious experience.
Justin Maciah,
sports visionary.
Maciah: I’ve created the United
Kickboxing Association.
This one of your
future champs?
Yeah, someday.
He needs a little bit of work,
but he's pretty sharp.
He took you apart, Sloan.
That last move was
a woman's bullshit move.
He has his problems
with the Sloans.
Both of your brothers
beat him in the ring.
Neil Vargas.
Yeah, heavyweight
kickboxing champion.
Can we talk business,
David?
I have a business, Justin.
How long can you
hold onto this place?
A month?
Two?
Come on.
It's a dinosaur.
I'll take
a small-time sport
and turn it into
an international commodity.
I need a spokesperson,
someone the fighters and
corporate sponsors respect.
Cable contracts,
product endorsements,
merchandising...
The word is...
I think the word
you're looking for is "hype".
This is something people wait
their whole lives for.
This could be your
last chance to be somebody.
I am somebody.
See, I'm a teacher.
I don't think I want any part
of your three ring circus.
I'm very disappointed, David.
You should learn to live
with disappointment, Maciah.
It builds character.
Come on, Neil.
Call me
when you're ready, Brian.
Some of what he said
made sense.
Come on, Brian.
That guy's a con man.
I’ve seen people like him
all of my life.
He’s gonna take a sport
that we both love,
that we'd die for,
and destroy it.
He said I'm ready
to turn pro.
So, you think I'm holding
you back, champ?
Nah...
You coming over
for dinner tonight?
- Yeah, what’s cooking?
- Mom's pot roast.
Ouch!
Listen, she thinks
everybody likes it.
Not a word from me.
I promise.
Why don't you go
hit the weights?
Joe: Stop harassing
the fighters, you little punk.
Get outta here.
Hey!
So, who's the wise guy?
Name's Joey D'Angelo.
I came here to fight.
This lowlife here
is challenging our students.
So, you want to fight?
What about it, asshole?
I wanna train.
Do you got
money for lessons?
If I had money do you think
I'd be in this crappy dump?
I heard you give freebies.
Yeah, well you heard wrong.
You wanna train here,
you’ve got to prove yourself.
You clean the bathrooms.
When you see me
you smile
and say,
"Good morning, Mr. Sloan",
like you enjoy it.
If I catch you
not smiling one time,
I'm gonna throw you out
onto the streets. You got that?
Now, what makes you think
you're good enough to train?
He’s not.
I mean, look at the kid.
He’s small.
Obviously he's weak...
If you wasn't a chick
I'd rip off your damn head.
Get what I'm saying?
You know something?
You talk too much.
You shouldn't swear
all the time.
When you swear all the time
it loses its meaning.
Got that?
Go to hell!
Okay, here's the deal...
you kick this bag 500 times
and I'll train you.
I could kick that bag
five billion times.
500 times will be just fine.
I'm telling you,
you're in trouble.
You are two months behind
on the mortgage payment.
These are all
outstanding bills.
You got any suggestions?
Yeah, you start fighting again.
Aside from that.
Fighting pays the bills.
That's how your brothers
made this gym.
I could get you some exhibition
bouts like Kurt used to take.
Fighting killed him.
What killed your brothers
was fighting in Thailand.
I know you never thought you
were as good as your brothers.
Not as strong.
Not as fast.
But Kurt and Eric always said
you had the biggest heart.
And heart can win
a lot of fights.
Just think about it, David.
Meanwhile, we’ve got
bills to pay.
I'm not going to fight
anymore, Jack.
Okay then...
at least raise the mat rates
and locker fees.
Most of these fighters
can't afford the rates
we’re charging them now.
We also talked about
phasing out the youth program.
We're not phasing it out.
What are you, Mother Theresa?
What about aerobics classes?
They make money.
Aerobics classes.
Kurt and Eric would come back
from their graves
and beat my ass.
David, I’ve been in this gym
since your brothers started it.
You're like
a kid brother to me.
There's only
so much I can do.
You know I appreciate
everything you're doing for me.
Gimme that.
Go on, get out of here.
I'll do what I can here.
I gotta fix my feet.
Yeah, you fix your feet.
I got a date with
an overcooked pot roast.
Hey, Jack...
thanks, man.
Okay.
How's he doing?
He did about 367,
so he has about...
133 left.
Hey, tough guy.
What?
- You got a place to stay?
- I got 1000 places.
You got a cot down in the basement
if you finish your test.
You got that?
Don't let him cripple himself.
Yeah.
Woman: How is it?
It's great, Mrs. Wagner.
Yeah, it's great, Mom.
I think I overcooked
it a little.
No, it's perfect.
Let's get out of here
and go for a walk.
It’s your turn
to wash the dishes.
It's Kristen's turn.
Mom.
Brian's getting tough
to live with.
Yeah.
I'll help you out.
Gotta go to Susie's.
See you later, David.
Yeah.
Brian said he had an offer
to become a professional.
Yeah.
That's right.
He’s ready, isn't he?
Yeah, as a fighter,
he's ready.
In the ring he's as good
as I’ve ever seen.
But, he's just not ready
in other ways.
Brian has his mind
set on doing this now,
and no one can
talk him out of it.
Look after him.
Don't let him get hurt.
Sometimes it's better to flow
than to attack.
Sometimes it's better
to attack.
Yeah.
And the wise man
knows when to do which, right?
Dad used to work in a factory
12 hours a day.
He flowed.
What did it get him?
A heart attack.
Boom!
It's not gonna
happen to me.
At least let me
get you a good manager.
Maciah is wrong for you.
You're wrong for me, David.
Who are you
to give me advice?
You're about to lose
your brothers' gym.
Don't try to drag me
down with you.
- Hey!
- Stay the fuck out of my way.
Jack!
Yes, it's me.
Listen, set me up
with that fight, okay?
Before I change
my mind.
David: You're coming
along great.
I'm really proud of you.
You're doing really good.
Don't worry about being
the same as the other guy,
because everybody's different.
We all have our own styles.
That's why we’ve developed
different forms of martial arts.
There's karate, judo,
ju-jitsu, kickboxing.
All of these
different disciplines
have one thing in common,
a single goal.
Yeah!
To kick ass.
Shut up!
Thank you for pointing out
the universal truth.
A small mind and big mouth
is usually found together.
Control!
Hey, control is everything.
Whether you're a fighter,
a carpenter, or a lawyer,
a banker, whatever you do,
the obstacles you face in life
is gonna be the same.
Daily life is full
of obstacles and temptations
that's gonna try and break
the smooth surface of the mind.
Control is how you overcome
these temptations.
You control your emotions,
you control your life.
Okay, hit the showers.
David.
I can't hardly blame him.
Yeah, right.
So what'd you get?
Saturday night at the Civic.
Who?
Neil Vargas.
Jesus Christ, Jack!
That's a UKA bout.
There're no other bouts to be had.
Everybody's caving in to Maciah.
I got you a good deal.
If it makes you
feel any better,
you don't have
any other options.
You guys know where
the locker room is.
Be there in a bit.
Your brothers would have been
real proud of you today.
Why don't you be here
by yourself and get ready,
and then come on back
and we'll get warmed up?
We all walk in the shadow
of those who go before us.
I'm Sangha, Maciah's
business partner in the UKA.
Welcome.
I have a lot riding
on you this evening.
I just came by
to wish you good luck.
Thanks.
Come on!
Get a towel.
Watch it, David.
He’ll throw a cheap shot.
You gotta be
a technician.
Stick and jab,
bob and weave.
Stick and jab,
bob and weave.
It's time
to rock and roll.
Let's go, champ.
Hit him with the jab,
then with the legs.
High and low.
High and low.
You’ve got to know
what to do with this guy.
You're a thinker out there.
You're a chess player.
King of the ring tonight!
King of the ring!
- Tonight's the night.
- D-day!
You won't work with Maciah,
but you'll take on his fighters.
I don't see the difference.
The difference is
he doesn't own me.
Let's go, champ.
Ladies and gentleman,
the United Kickboxing
Association of America
welcomes you
to your main event!
In this corner,
in his first fight
in over two years...
David Sloan.
David Sloan!
He is one of the legendary
fighting Sloans!
And in this corner,
the UKA heavyweight
champion,
Neil Vargas!
To the boxers,
their instructions...
here’s your referee,
Judo Gene Labelle.
I wanna clean fight
from both of you.
Vargas, none of your
wrestling bull shit.
Sloan, no aikido.
Now, you know
the U.S. Commission rules.
No knees, no elbows,
you must hit
with a closed fist.
I want you to shake hands,
go to your corners,
when you hear the bell,
come out and fight.
Best of luck.
This guy's been out
for a year and a half.
Jump right on him
and get him outta there.
I'm gotta hurt you, Sloan.
(bell rings)
Fight!
There’s your woman
bullshit move, sweetheart.
Go to your neutral corner!
Three... four...
fight!
Get him!
All right!
Hey, ref, this isn't
a wrestling match!
Come on, Mr. Sloan.
Fight!
He’s wrestling
with him, ref!
Break free!
Keep it clean!
Okay, fight!
To a neutral corner!
Three... four...
five... six...
Are you okay?
All right, move it!
(bell rings)
(bell rings again)
What the hell
are you doing?
You're a chess player!
You’ve got to watch
his legs!
Stick and jab.
Bob and weave!
(crowd whistles)
Stay inside of him!
(bell rings)
Fight!
Stick and jab!
Yes!
Get to a neutral corner!
Three... four...
five... six...
seven... eight...
(crowd cheers wildly)
Five...
six...
seven...
eight...
nine...
ten!
You're out!
Winner!
(crowd cheers)
That was an incredible comeback.
What was the key to victory?
The UKA is all hype,
just like its paper champions.
Well, David, you're not
implying that...
No. I'm saying it. The UKA is
crooked and is drug-ridden.
What are your plans?
Who’s your next opponent?
There'll be none.
As of now, I'm retiring.
I’ve got what I came for.
There you have it. I don't know
what's more shocking...
the fight or this announcement
by David Sloan afterwards...
that he is retiring...
there'll be no more fights.
God damn him!
Some champion!
It hasn't been an hour since
he spouted off to the press,
and already
I'm getting calls!
Tren Tex and the other
sponsors want
to pull their money
and support!
Edwards from the State Licensing
Board is on my ass!
Sloan's gonna bring this
whole thing down!
He must fight again.
See to it that he accepts
another challenge.
Wait a minute,
you heard him.
Nobody's going to get him
into the ring again.
Besides, what the hell good
is that going to do me anyway?
Revenge.
Take his world out
from under him.
Does that suit your needs?
Sleep easy, tough guy.
Man: Here's a little
pay back, Sloan!
David!
Okay, that’s enough.
Let's get outta here!
David!
David!
The boy died, David.
I'm sorry.
Jack's bringing someone
to help you,
your brothers' teacher
from Thailand.
Who are you?
Xian.
Xian.
How did you get here?
Super-saver.
I also got free rental car and
half-priced tickets to Disneyland.
Just get out of here, okay?
Make me.
Just leave me alone.
Let me tell you the story about
the mouse and the alligator.
Look, a kid just died
because of me.
I'm not in the mood
for any of this, okay?
I'm sorry.
If you don't want to hear,
you must make me stop.
Fine. Tell me the stupid story
about the stupid fucking mouse.
Very well, if you insist.
Once, a very long,
long time ago,
there was a mouse who
wanted to cross a river.
Or was it a chicken?
Would you like some coffee?
Please.
I have a job for you.
To understand the importance,
I must relay to you
what happened
a year ago in Thailand.
David Sloan's brother, Kurt,
defeated our champion Tong Po.
He shamed our nation.
We sought a rematch.
And one night,
consumed by his humiliation
Tong Po made it impossible
to ever regain our honor.
(gunshot)
At the moment,
it seemed there would never be
a chance to regain our honor,
then I learned of Sloan's
brother, David.
As you know
in our tradition,
if a father could not defend
his family's honor,
then the son would.
David Sloan will give
Tong Po the rematch
that his brother's death
denied us.
What about his injuries?
Kurt Sloan's teacher has come
from Thailand to heal David.
Even if he heals,
will Sloan fight?
One guess.
Make sure nothing happens
to David Sloan.
Or you will pay
with your life.
Arrange a meeting
between Maciah
and David's former student,
Brian Wagner.
To catch a tiger
one must bait the trap.
Man: Mr. Sangha wanted us
to meet, Brian.
I'm glad
you could come by.
I can't believe this place!
I think I'll be happy here.
What about you, Brian?
Are you happy?
I'm doing okay.
Where’ve you been?
You're instructor says
you're not working out.
David said you had something
to do with burning down the gym.
Would I risk losing all this?
And what would I have to gain
by hurting him?
Nothing.
The police have cleared me.
Vargas acted on his own.
If a man like David
loses everything,
he has to blame somebody else.
He creates enemies.
I used to be like that once.
People thought I was nothing
when I was growing up.
Do you know what it's like
growing up hating who you are?
I’ve struggled all my life
to prove them wrong.
I was gonna be somebody.
I was gonna make it big
no matter what.
And you have, Mr. Maciah.
I have an offer
to make you, Brian.
I think
you're gonna like it.
You wanna fight
for the championship?
Yeah.
Good!
Woman: Let's have a look.
You’re very lucky, David.
How do you feel?
- Pretty lousy.
- Excuse me?
Nothing. I was just thinking
about somebody.
I need more strength, Brian.
If you can't give me more strength,
I'm gonna double your regimen.
What's wrong with you?
This is what you get for hanging
around with that shit for so long!
I'm tapped out!
If you could sign
where indicated,
in triplicate,
then you can be on your way.
May we begin now?
I don't want
none of your help.
I don't want anyone
near me right now.
You need me.
It's simple logic.
You didn't do
my brothers any good.
What do you think
you're gonna do for me?
* Too hurt to cry *
* I'm holding back the tears *
* I want to run and hide
from all the wasted years *
* In this lonely room
I sit and stare *
* A man alone *
* A man alone *
* A man alone *
* There's a cold feeling *
* It's like ice
around my heart *
* I feel confusion
in my mind *
* And it's tearing
me apart *
* Too hurt to cry *
* I'm holding back the tears *
* I want to run and hide
from all the wasted years *
* In this lonely room
I sit and stare *
* A man alone *
* A man alone *
* A man alone. *
(knocking on door)
Go away!
It's Joe!
Just go away.
Unlock the door.
It's not locked.
It's just stuck.
You look like shit!
What you're doing
to people isn't fair.
You always believed
in teaching by example, right?
Well, what kind
of example is this, Sloan?
You know Joey's dead
because of me!
It's not your fault!
Why don't you talk to Xian?
He helped your brothers.
Why can't he help you too?
Janelle, just leave me alone!
Get up!
What do you want?
Get up!
You are a Sloan!
I'm not as good
as Kurt and Eric!
I never was!
And you never will be.
Is that what
you're thinking?
Hey, don't push me!
Stop me, then.
Go on!
Hit me!
I think I'm wasting my time.
You think by coming here
and training me
everything's gonna
be okay?
That I'm gonna get Joey back,
and my gym and my students?
You think everything's
gonna be okay?
Not an easy task!
But I can teach you
how to walk.
Walk?
I know how to walk.
Really?
Show me.
Can you move?
Gee, thanks.
Trainer: Double up!
Come on, double up!
Double up!
You can do better
in your fights! Hit it!
Who do you think you're fighting
out there? A rookie?
The old man is good.
David is getting better.
The circle will
soon be complete.
What's the second step
in training?
What do I know?
You're supposed to have
all the answers, right?
I'm getting old.
I forget things.
Right now,
I forget how to begin.
Your strength, right?
You're supposed to test
the limits of your strength.
You begin from there.
How did you train Kurt?
You're going senile.
The stronger the body,
the stronger the mind.
Or is it the stronger the mind,
the stronger the body?
It's one of those two.
Pick up the rope.
Do you have a firm grasp?
Yeah.
Now tell me
what's down there.
Aghh!
Neighborhood's
going to shit!
Now you'll have
to climb back up!
Sometimes I forget
girls can be so beautiful.
What are you?
A dirty old man?
The girls...
the weather, the sun,
the sea,
it's beautiful.
So what?
My wife was beautiful.
I didn't know
you were married.
A long time ago.
We never did have a child.
But my niece, Mah-Li,
she became ours.
And then she met
your brother, Kurt.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry about that.
In life you are only living
if you move forward.
So I move forward,
one step at a time,
but always forward.
You have learned
how to walk, David.
You're fighting the champion
in a couple of days.
This will make you stronger.
Don't you think we ought
to wait a few minutes...
until my body
is more relaxed?
This way every muscle cell
gets a full dose.
Jesus! What a rush.
My body feels like
it's going to explode.
That'll pass...
I'll see you in the sparring
ring in five minutes.
Excuse me for disturbing you.
I'm Sangha.
You're Mr. Maciah's partner.
I must say our training methods
in Thailand are different.
We're more advanced
in America.
You guys make great
stereos and shit.
Thinking of Japan, perhaps?
Oh, yeah.
It's all right, Brian.
Most of us don't know
much about America either.
I just wanted to welcome
you to our family,
wish you good luck.
Thanks, Mr. Sangha.
I believe you had a different
trainer before you came to us.
His name was...
David Sloan.
Oh, yes...
and why is he
no longer with you?
We sort of went
our separate ways.
The relationship between
student and teacher
is very sacred.
You have a big fight
coming up.
Mr. Sloan must be there to share
with you in the moment of glory.
I don't think he'd come.
He brought you this far.
Ask him, Brian.
Hey, David.
Hey, Brian.
How's the leg?
It itches.
Listen, David.
I want to help you out.
- I’ve got plenty of money.
- Are you kidding me?
Forget about it.
I'm fighting Lou Lescano for
the championship Wednesday night.
I heard you had a fight
not less than two weeks ago.
I can handle it.
Yeah, I bet.
You taking vitamins
to keep up your strength?
I've got the best trainers...
That money can buy, right?
David, I really
want you to be there.
Here are some tickets.
Bring my Mom.
I’ve been waiting for this
all of my life.
They’ve got him on steroids.
People make choices.
He’s made his.
Yeah.
How are you feeling, kid?
Deadly.
Fucking deadly.
Go get him.
Assistant:
Your night tonight.
(crowd starts cheering)
Ladies and gentlemen,
in this corner...
the number one contender
in the world,
Brian "The Hammer" Wagner!
Brian Wagner!
(crowd cheers)
That's the way
it's gotta be.
I can live with that, as long
as the kid's got a taste.
- Hey, Lou.
- What is this?
Shut up and do
what your manager says.
Eddie, do you mind?
We need privacy.
Come here.
There's been a change.
You can't fight.
You’ve got an injury.
What?
Per Maciah, there's been
a change in plan.
Where the hell is he?
Excuse me, but I don't think
we can do this.
Do what?
Tell him to make
the announcement.
What announcement?
Tell him, or else
our investment ceases.
You'll be left with nothing.
Um, just make
the announcement.
But, it's against
Commission Rules.
Just make the announcement,
damn it!
Okay.
(bell rings)
Announcer: We apologize
for the delay,
but there has been a change.
Lightening Lou Lescano
has withdrawn from the fight,
due to illness.
(crowd boos)
Fighting in his place,
from Thailand...
the fighter's name is Tong Po,
ladies and gentlemen.
Tong Po!
Aw, Christ!
What the hell
is going on here, Maciah?
That fighter isn't licensed
in this state.
Hey, let me go!
Get your hands off me!
Hey, you don't have
to fight him.
It's no problem.
I'll kill him.
Your friend
is in great danger.
What the hell
is going on?
Tong Po is what
this is all about.
(fight bell rings)
(crowd roars)
Coach: Stay out of his way.

(crowd roars)

Fight clean!
No knees!
Coach: Do your damn job, ref!
Coach: Brian, come on!
Break!

You'll be

(crowd whistles)
(fight bell rings)
(crowd cheers and whistles)
(snorting)
Coach: Man, look out!
Get out of there, Brian.
Get away from his legs!
Take it easy.
Stay away now.
Elbow!
Illegal elbow!
Xian: This fight
must be stopped!
He killed your brothers.
Coach: Come on, Brian.
Stay on your feet!
Get away from those legs!
(fight bell rings)
Coach: Quit screwing around.
Referee: How’s your fighter?
I'm gonna have to call this fight.
Coach: We're okay, here.
Referee: If he gets into trouble,
I'm calling it...
Coach: We're okay here, Doc.
Don't worry.
Referee: All right.
Brian!
He’s a goddamn bull.
I'm holding my own, right?
This guy is gonna
hurt you bad.
I'm gonna
hurt him back.
Stay away
from the fighter.
Brian, listen to me.
Get out of the ring.
This guy's gonna
hurt you.
Nobody can beat me!
I'm begging you. Tong Po's
the guy that killed my brothers.
No fucking way!
I don't quit.
(fight bell rings)
Referee: Five seconds
on the ring.
Fight!
All right.
Neutral corner.
Judge: Get away from me!
You gotta stop the fight!
All right, fight!
Judge: Who do you think
you are?
Get him out of here!
Goddamn asshole!
(bones crunching)
Referee: Hold it!
Step back!
Coach: Ref, do your job.
Our guy's hurt, okay?
That's it!
Coach: Somebody stop
this asshole.
(crowd boos wildly)
Brian!
Coach: No!
Brian!
You're finished, Maciah!
Just get out of here
and leave me alone!
Get out!
Out!
Fuck you!
There's gonna
be criminal charges.
You're through!
You're washed up, pal.
You’ve done
your job well, Justin.
You creep.
You used me.
Yes...
and now our business
relationship is over.
You just destroyed
everything I worked for.
For your time and trouble.
This is a lot of money.
It's only money, Justin.
Some things money can't buy.
Fortunately for me...
you're not
one of those things.
(distant ambulance siren)
(flat line beep)
David: I'm sorry.
Oh, no!
Oh, God!
He can’t be dead.
The match is yours...
Here...
two hours.
Man: Thanks.
Tell me one
of your stories, Xian.
Come on,
one of those...
animal stories.
Once there was an elephant
and a rhinoceros.
The elephant was unstoppable
when he was on the run
and when the rhinoceros
wanted to stay where he was...
he was immovable.
The elephant knew that.
One day the elephant
decided to charge
the rhinoceros.
You know what happened?
They killed each other.
You have heard this before.
No...
I guess I'm just
getting to know you.
So I am no longer inscrutable?
That is too bad.
Maybe this time your story
has a different ending.
Maybe this time
one of the animals lives.
Sangha sent you to me,
didn't he?
He did it through Morrison.
Sangha tricked us both.
He wanted to make sure
you were a worthy opponent.
I thought I could
protect you.
I was wrong.
I'm an old fool.
Or maybe worse...
What are you talking about?
Tong Po killed my niece
along with your brothers.
Maybe a part of me
wants revenge.
Maybe a part of me is willing
to sacrifice you to get it.
If that is so...
I am no better than Sangha.
This is my fight.
It's just something
I’ve got to do, now.
You didn't think I'd miss
one of your fights, did ya?
Brian's mom told me
what happened.
Here’s your gear, champ.
Yeah, thanks, man.
You know what may happen?
If your leg is hurt...
David, you don't have
to fight with Thai.
It's not just using glass.
It's fighting with no rules.
You could be killed.
Hundreds of years ago...
this was how we fought.
The video is for
our people at home,
to prove that we have
regained our honor.
It ain't over...
Until the fat lady sings.
I'm familiar
with that expression.
Your fight will time until one
of you can no longer continue.
Understood?
(neck cracks)
You're the weakest...
of all the Sloans.
Xian: David!
I see no fat lady.
I hear no singing.
So, it's not over yet.
Concentrate.
The most fierce weapon
is the human mind.
Now go kick his ass
and let's go home!
David: Remember, sometimes
when you're blind,
and times seem darkest,
you can often see
more clearly.
I tell you what...
you take your best shot.
(gun clicks)
Is this what you call honor?
I have no honor!
When a man loses his honor,
he has nothing.
(tires screeching)
You are not as good a teacher,
as you are a student.
You must have patience.
Did I block the sidewalk?
Boy: What does he do?
He’s great.
He’s a real champion.
Champion?
What makes him so special?
Come on.
Mr. Sloan!
This here's Carl.
He’s the new punk
in the neighborhood.
He doesn't take
anything on faith.
How are you doing, Carl?
He doesn't look
like a champion to me.
(kids boo)
Kid: Show him.
Just let me see it.
Okay, kid.
You take your best shot.
(music playing)
Time out!
My treat!
Kids: Yeah!
Did I ever
tell you the story
about the water buffalo
and the caterpillar?
I don't think so.
Or was it...
the tiger
and the dragon?
* You felt
the distant thunder... *
No, I think it's the caterpillar
and the water buffalo.
* Knocking at your door *
* You couldn't find
a reason *
* For living anymore *
* But the power lies
within you *
* To keep your life
from slipping away *
* And deep inside you know
the faith in who you are now *
* Is growing stronger everyday *
* You take what you need *
* But you give so much more *
* Trying to hold onto heaven *
* When it's hell at your door *
* So you fight
your way through *
* Those dreams so black *
* Oh, and take another
step now *
* On the long road back *
* Now it's all up to you *
* To be who you are *
* There's no one else
out there *
* Who's gonna reach
for your star *
* You got to stand up
and fight *
* Before you’re ready
to leave *
* Oh-oh...
and take another step now *
* For what you believe *
* Now it's all up to you *
(guitar solo)
* Now it's all up to you *
* To be who you are *
* Because there's no one
else out there *
* Who can reach
for your stars *
* You’ve got to stand up
and fight *
* Before you’re ready
to leave *
* Oh-oh...
and take another step now *
* For what you believe *
* Now it's all up to you *
* Shoo-be-doo,
yeah, yeah. *
