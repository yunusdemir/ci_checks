He´s had to fly to Geneva.
Then I may as well
get back to the house.
You must arrange another date.
We´re running out of time.
Yes, Mr. Tubbs.
You hear that?
It´s a no show.
Repeat...
it´s a no show.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, chaps,
scrub it.
Better luck next time.
You´re getting
far too thin, John.
You ought to eat some more
of that lovely pie,
get a bit of meat on you.
Don´t you think he´s
getting thin, Nigel?
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no.
Chablis should be
cellar cool,
not frozen to death
in the fridge.
You´ve got to give a girl
something to hold onto.
I´ll attend to it
right away, sir.
Steak and kidney pie.
Potatoes, runner beans,
and chard.
Thank you.
Everything all right,
Mrs. Davie?
Oh, yes.
Lovely, dear, thank you.
But it hasn´t been
in the fridge.
I put that on ice myself
20 minutes ago.
It´s absolutely perfect.
You know what he´s like.
The other night
the claret was too warm.
Give it to me.
We´ll leave it over here
and then take it back
in five minutes.
I swear he does it
on purpose.
"Chablis should be
cellar cool,
not frozen to death
in a fridge."
I´ll bet he´s heard someone
say that on television.
Evening.
Hello, Henderson.
Busy?
Oh, so-so.
Few of the regulars, you know.
Yeah
Well, let´s see.
Um...
There´s Mrs. Davie.
She eats half her pie
and has the other half
put in a doggie bag.
Got to keep an eye on her
because she´s got this tendency
to drop off in
between mouthfuls.
And over there we´ve got
one of my favorite customers,
the wine snob.
He sends back every bottle
of wine he ever orders,
and he can´t tell
Burgundy from bath water.
Here we´ve got
the aging hippie.
Quite a recent addition,
actually.
Comes in on Tuesdays
and Fridays.
Always has the same thing --
pie and a glass of red wine.
I quite like him.
Always sends me little
messages about the food.
And here,
just to round
the evening off nicely,
we have
the love/hate couple.
By the end of the evening, they
will either be having a punch-up
or tearing each other´s
clothes off.
Both if they get going
on the cognac.
Would you like a drink while
you look at the menu?
Yes, why not?
We´ll have a bottle of the house
white, shall we, sweetheart?
Yes, lovely.
Bottle of house white.
Oh, I don´t know.
If I have the steak
and kidney pie,
perhaps red
would be better.
I´ll have whatever you want,
sweetheart.
I´m sorry I´m so hopeless.
Can we have another minute?
Of course.
No problem.
Oh, Linda,
what´s the matter?
I have got
the love/hate couple.
One Stilton and one crème brulée
for table 8, please.
Right away.
Table 4 would
like to know
if his bottle of wine
is ready yet.
Yes, yes. Of course.
There it is, take it in.
Now, it´s exactly the same,
but I bet you he doesn´t
notice the difference.
Watch.
Here we go.
"Oh, yes, much better.
Yes, the flavors are really
starting to come through now."
Much better!
The flavor´s really starting
to come through now.
A hint of gooseberry,
but pure, almost buttery.
Rather elegant, actually.
But still earthy.
Sounds just
like you, John.
I rest my case.
Oh, watch out, Linda.
Mrs. Doggie Bag´s
nodding off.
Could you put the rest
of this in a bag
for Oscar, please?
Of course, Mrs. Davie.
Thank you.
Linda, tell him
I think he´s put a little suet
in the shortcrust pastry today.
Right, so there´s the new
menu ideas for next week.
Henderson´s got a lot
of very knobbly tomatoes
mutating in his greenhouse,
so I think we should have
some tomato salad
to go along with
the spinach-and-onion tarts.
And, also, I think we
should have a bash
at making some of that
tomato-and-red-pepper soup.
Oh, and by the way,
Steve and I are going to have
to go to London next week.
Oh, yeah?
Well, there are various
things we have to do.
Lunch.
No, actually.
No.
We need some most
excellent parmesan
to go with the salad
that we´re making out
of Henderson´s rocket.
And some balsamic vinegar.
And some olive oil.
Olive oil.
And only then, if there´s
any time left at all,
we might be able
to grab a snack.
It´s definitely lunch.
Afternoon.
Hello!
Welcome.
Come on, Cambridge, you must
know why he wanted to see me.
There´s nothing that
happens in this place
without you know
all about it.
All I know is that he´s had
this DCI from the Met
in and out of
his office all week.
His name is Fields,
and he´s in charge
of some investigation
that´s moved on to our patch.
Then Julian Tubbs came in.
Julian Tubbs?
The MP, sir.
He had a meeting with Fields and
Mr. Fisher yesterday afternoon,
and that´s when
your name came up.
"Get Crabbe," Mr. Fisher
said through gritted teeth.
Thank you.
Come.
Crabbe. I suppose you
better sit down.
Thank you, sir.
What you are about
to hear, Crabbe,
must not be discussed
with anyone.
Anyone outside this room.
Fine.
Frankly, you´re the last
person I want involved,
but for reasons that
shall become obvious,
I´ve got no choice.
That´s very kind
of you, sir.
For the last 12 months,
DCI Fields has been conducting
a fraud squad investigation.
It seems this
investigation
might now be
reaching fruition.
The suspect is about
to make a move,
and it´s my job
to be there when he does.
When he does what, sir?
We´re talking about bribery
and corruption of public
officials at the highest level.
And that´s all you need
to know, Crabbe.
Sir.
Uh, what exactly has it got
to do with me, sir?
You´ve got
a restaurant
called the Pie in the Sky,
right?
Uh, no, no.
Actually, I haven´t, sir.
But I thought --
No, no, you see, it´s my wife
that owns the restaurant.
As a serving officer, I simply
wouldn´t be allowed to...
All right, Crabbe,
don´t be so literal.
Sorry, sir.
Yeah, well, the bottom
line is this.
I´m working for a specialist
surveillance team,
and I need to get them
in there and wire the place
from top to bottom,
upside down, inside out.
Uh...
get the team
inside where, sir?
Inside your restaurant,
of course.
It turns out our suspect is
one of your regular customers.
One of my regulars?
We have reason to believe
that said subject
will be meeting certain
persons at the restaurant
and conspiring to commit
a criminal act.
So my team will be in there
recording every word,
every gesture.
I want your complete
cooperation on this, Crabbe.
But, uh, recording, sir?
We get a complete
audiovisual record
of that meeting, Crabbe,
and boo-boom...
we get a major result.
Thank you, Inspector.
Ah, thank you, sir.
I hate to mention proper food
in these circumstances,
but are we going to have
lunch in Chinatown?
´Cause I really fancy
trying the steamed dumplings
you´re on about.
Well, I´m afraid
there´s been
a slight change
of plan there, Steve.
See, um...
Well, there won´t be time
for lunch, not for me, anyway.
I´ve got to go and meet a friend
of mine in Scotland Yard.
Well, in that case, I´ll see
you in Covent Garden.
You won´t catch me
in there.
I´m sorry, Phil.
I don´t see you
for all these years,
and then when I do, it´s only
because I want something.
Nah, it´s good hearing
from you anyway, Henry.
It´s just I thought to myself,
"If there´s anyone
"who´s even heard a whisper
about this business,
it´s probably Phil Bower."
Rick Fields working
for the fraud office.
Ha! It´d be funny
if it wasn´t so tragic.
Yep, that´s the modern
police force --
Whoops, sorry.
Beg your pardon.
Modern police service
for you.
Evening, all.
So what do you think Fisher
and Fields are up to then?
There.
Fields is after that chappy,
according to my information.
Duncan Spellar,
a very rich bastard.
But you wouldn´t think so
to look at him.
He´s into publishing,
travel, radio, TV.
Recognize him?
Mm, yes.
Comes into the restaurant.
Oh, well,
there you go then.
Little tincture?
No thanks.
Not while I´m on duty, sir.
I tell you what though,
Henry...
My advice is...
don´t get involved.
This sort of thing,
it´s political.
It´s not for
the likes of us.
Well, I do not intend
to get involved.
I simply wanted to know
what was going on
in the restaurant.
Thanks, Phil.
Don´t mention it.
Can I ask you something?
Fire away.
What do you actually
do here?
Do?
I don´t do anything.
Private contractor
is my job now.
Just sitting out
my last six months.
Must be tough.
Oh, no.
It´s fine, it´s fine.
You see, something wonderful
has happened to me, Henry.
Something...
totally unexpected.
I found Jesus.
So I fill my days
with prayer.
Things couldn´t be better.
Well, I have to go now.
Bye.
And, uh...
take care.
Ugh.
Oh, the hell
with the expense.
Let´s upgrade ourselves
to first class, eh?
Yeah.
And not a word
to Margaret.
Mr. Crabbe.
There´s a bloke.
I think he wants you.
Come and join us.
There´s plenty of room.
I´ve reserved a compartment.
Gary, Dean, can we clear
some of this stuff away?
Come in.
Come in.
Hi.
Here, let me give you
a hand.
Now, you´re sure
we´re not barging in?
No, no, I´ve done
enough work for today.
Duncan, we ought to talk
about the other contracts.
Later.
Did you get my message about
the pastry the other night?
Yes, you were right.
There was suet in it.
He´s got the most
exquisite palate, you know.
Don´t bother talking
to them about food.
They´re from the cheeseburger
generation.
Shh, listen.
We´re going over some points.
There. Hear it?
No, Duncan,
and we never do.
Used to be a junction there.
Branch line to St. Elgar.
Built by Brunel in 1845.
Broad gauge, of course.
Oh, of course.
Do I smell salami?
Yes, Milanese.
It´s excellent.
You should try some.
You´ll need some
bread with it.
Can you get the olives while
you´re up there, Steve?
I know, let´s have
a bottle of wine
while we´re at it,
shall we?
Picnic. This could only
happen on a train, guys.
Mm.
Cheltenham Flyer used to run
on this line, you know.
June 6, 1932.
Engine number 5006.
The Tregenna Castle.
It did the 77 miles between
Swindon and Paddington
in just under 56 minutes.
Do you like trains, Henry?
Well, if I can find
a seat on them, yeah.
Makes me really angry
the way they´re running down
the service on this line.
But things will be different
when I´m in charge.
Sorry?
I´ve applied
for the franchise
to operate the service
on this line.
I´m going to run a railway.
Not a chance.
No way.
Thank God.
I´ll never make money.
These guys don´t think
I stand a chance.
The powers that be
can´t stand him.
He´s a member of the Labour
Party, for God´s sake.
Join the Tory Party,
give them 100 grand,
and you might squeak in.
Sir Duncan.
Sir Duncan.
Listen to them.
So young and yet so cynical.
What do you reckon, Henry?
Think I´ll triumph over
my enemies
and return the Cheltenham Flyer
to its former glory?
Well, let´s hope so.
The Tregenna Castle
was clocked
at 92.4 miles per hour
over this stretch.
In 1932.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
And a couple
of large pumpkins.
Pumpkins?
For the pasta.
Pumpkin pasta?
What, you mean like
spaghetti and pumpkin?
No.
Weird.
No, no, no, no.
You scoop the flesh
out of the pumpkin,
put it in foil, and bosh it
in the oven for an hour.
Then you take it out
and mash it up
with a couple of egg yolks
and a hint of nutmeg
and then add some parmesan.
Then you take a dollop
of that mixture
and put it on
some fresh pasta.
Then you seal it and then
poach it in salt water,
and there you are --
pumpkin ravioli.
That´s got to be
dead fiddly, innit?
Making all those
little ravioli by hand.
No, no, no, no.
It´s a giant ravioli.
You only get one
in a portion.
Well, if there´s
only one in a portion,
I think you should call it
raviolo, in the singular.
Otherwise, people might
get the wrong idea.
You´re unbelievable,
you know, the pair of you.
We´re closed.
So what you´re saying is
you want some pumpkins.
Exactly! Yes.
Crabbe?
Henry, someone for you.
I´m off.
Uh, Margaret, this is Detective
Chief Inspector Fields.
Are you
Mrs. Crabbe?
Yes.
Anyone else
on the premises?
No.
All right, lads,
in you come.
Henry, what´s going on?
I´m sorry, Margaret --
We need to check
the layout of the place.
Get an idea of the sort of
equipment we´re going to need.
Equipment?
Tables are
too close together.
Yeah, they pack ´em in like
sardines in cafes like this.
I beg your pardon!
Where´s the light switches,
sir?
Uh, over there.
I got problems with
my field of vision.
I can´t get an angle from
the van Into the restaurant.
Light levels
are very low.
We have to bring
a camera in here.
A remote through
the bulb is safer.
What happens
in the floor above?
We live there.
Problem solved --
we drill through,
put me and the monitor
in the room above.
Drill through?
We´re going to have
to rearrange the tables.
Shouldn´t be a problem
with the background noise.
Henry, I´m going upstairs,
and when you have a moment,
I´d like a word!
Is there any danger
of an hors d´oeuvre?
Fresh green salad, maybe,
and some garlic bread?
No, no danger
whatsoever.
Good night, madam.
Thanks for coming.
Enjoy your holiday.
Would you like some more
coffee, Mr. Spellar?
No, thanks.
Can I have a word
with Mr. Crabbe?
Yes, of course.
I hear Gershwin.
Yes, we play it
into the chickens
in the evening.
It helps them settle down.
It´s interesting, we´ve
had loads of double yolkers
ever since we started
playing Gershwin.
Full of surprises,
Henry.
A policeman who cooks,
plays music to his chickens.
Yes, well,
a very reluctant policeman,
as I think I explained
to you on the train.
Yes, I know.
It´s the policeman from
whom I need advice.
You´re supposed to say,
"I hope you´re not
in some sort of trouble."
I hope you´re not
in some sort of trouble.
Actually, I think I´m
being followed.
Why would anyone want
to follow you?
I have no idea.
Whoever they are, I don´t
see what they have to gain
by sitting outside
a restaurant in Middleton
while I eat
steak and kidney pie.
You mean someone´s
followed you here tonight?
There´s a white Granada
parked on the high street.
Do me a favor, when I leave --
see if they follow me.
Maybe I´m just being paranoid.
Good of you to come,
Cambridge.
Brought you some
coffee.
Oh, that´s very thoughtful.
Thank you.
Would you like one?
Bean sprouts on granary.
Don´t tempt me, Cambridge.
Right.
"White Granada,
Kilo-38-Delta-Juliet-Hotel."
Thank you.
It´s registered
in a company name.
Strongfellows Security
Consultants.
Oh, no, don´t tell me
it´s private detectives.
Yep. Divorce, matrimonial,
process serving.
It´s run by two women --
Kelly Strong and Lucy...
wait for it --
Fellows.
Oh, how very droll.
You going to tell me
what this is about?
Uh, n...
No, Cambridge, I´m not.
Oh, Margaret!
Margaret!
Damn.
I don´t know why people
drive so fast!
God, I hate car chases!
Crabbe!
Fancy meeting you here!
I don´t think he recognizes you
without a glass
in your hand, Nigel --
we come to your restaurant.
Oh, of course, yes.
How nice to see you.
Had the most incredible
luck the other day.
This friend of mine opened
a bottle
of Chateau l´Ange Belge --
I´m so sorry.
But the exit´s
this way.
Um, yes.
I´ve always been a Burgundy man
myself, as you probably know.
Look, I´m very sorry,
I want to get across over there,
you see.
Um, uh, bye.
You know, I think Mr. Crabbe
is a closet train spotter.
Two liver and bacon,
one pie.
Sorry!
One sorrel pancake
and two leek vinaigrette.
By the way,
Duncan Spellar called.
He wants you round his place
for tea this afternoon.
Thanks, Steve.
Oh, Mr. Crabbe.
Duncan´s in the old library.
Up the stairs, take
the corridor on your right,
and you can´t miss it.
Henry. Hi.
Come on in.
What do you think?
I like the trees
and cows.
Shouldn´t you have a train
driver´s cap on or something?
Yeah, I know
what you´re thinking.
Toys for the boys, grown men
playing with trains.
Whoo-whoo!
And now you want
a real,
full, life-sized one
all of your own.
Yep.
Isn´t it against
your principles,
buying up a nationalized
industry?
If everybody owns it already,
why should you have it?
Because...
if it isn´t me,
it will be someone else.
And one day when you get
a train up to London
to buy your salami
and olive oil,
it will be
business class only,
treble fares,
and the engine
will be named after
some hamburger.
I´ll do better
than that.
You think so?
When I started out,
people said,
"You´ll have to smarten up
and wear a suit;
otherwise, no one
will take you seriously."
But I thought, "No, that´s
their problem, not mine."
I take you seriously.
Does that mean you´re
going to help me?
How can I help you?
Come on, Henry,
you know what I mean.
Somebody´s after me.
You saw what happened
last night.
I´m being followed.
Watched, listened to.
Maybe this room is bugged.
Maybe we´re being
listened to this very minute.
Well, a good security firm
should sort that out for you.
I don´t want a good security
firm, I don´t trust them.
I want you.
Go to a police station
and make a complaint.
Go through
the proper channels.
I can´t help you
in my spare time.
It just doesn´t work
like that.
Here, you take
the goods train.
No, no, I´d
rather not, thank you.
Come on,
you´re in control.
What? I don´t want
to be in control.
Who´s following me,
Henry?
What?
Don´t tell me
you didn´t check
the registration number
of that Granada.
Look, the only reason
I´m a policeman still
is because they won´t
let me retire.
It´s no good trying to
appeal to my good nature
or my sense of fair play
because I lost both
of those years ago.
Henry, slow down.
I can´t.
I´m very sorry.
Human error.
Yeah. Just have to learn
to live with it.
Exactly.
I think I better go before
I break anything else.
Right.
I´ll see you tomorrow night.
You will?
I´ve booked a table
at the restaurant.
Business, I´m afraid.
I know you´ll look
out for us.
I´ll do my best.
What exactly were you doing at
Duncan Spellar´s house, Crabbe?
Well, he´s got this rather
wonderful railway set, sir,
and, you know, it´s got
stations and villages
and a farm with, um,
cows and sheep and so on,
and, well,
I never had a railway set
when I was a child.
You were playing
model railways?
Well, it´s not my sort
of thing.
I made a complete mess of it,
crashed the goods train.
For God´s sake, Crabbe,
answer the question!
How did you come to be
at Spellar´s house?
He´s one of my regular
customers, sir.
He´s interested in food
and wine, and we talk.
What´s so unusual
about that?
Duncan Spellar is the man
that I´m investigating.
That´s what´s so unusual,
Inspector.
Duncan Spellar?
Good God, what a surprise.
Who would have thought it,
eh?
Takes all sorts, I suppose.
I´ll be moving my team
in the restaurant this evening.
This evening?
Yes. Your little pal
with the train set will be
entertaining a very important
person this evening.
I´m surprised he didn´t
mention it, Crabbe.
I really need those pumpkins,
not to mention
onions, tomatoes, and beans.
And where the hell is Henderson?
Vanished into thin air.
Well, I´ve got enough
on my plate
without worrying
about Duncan Spellar.
Is that Julian Tubbs?
Yes, sir.
The MP?
Yes, sir.
One that´s been having these
meetings with Fisher and Fields?
Yes, sir.
Right.
Now, then...
Julian Tubbs MP hires these two
female private detectives
to follow Spellar round
and to spy and pry
and prod into
his private life, do you see?
Oh, obviously.
That´s how
Fisher and Fields knew
that I´d been round
to see Spellar.
Didn´t you say Spellar...
was applying for
a British Rail franchise?
Hm.
You see, the private
detectives tell Tubbs,
Tubbs tells Fisher,
and Fisher wheels me in.
Because Julian Tubbs MP
sits on a committee
which vets British Rail
franchise applications.
I -- I --
The question is, why is
Tubbs going to all this...
Tubbs is what?
There´s an article
about it here.
I´m looking at it --
Of course.
Of course!
You see, Spellar wants to buy
the rail franchise
that runs through Tubbs´
constituency,
but Tubbs cannot stand Spellar.
Not only is he left wing,
he´s also very rich.
It´s a terrible combination.
Tubbs will do anything to stop
Spellar winning the franchise,
so what does he do?
I don´t know, Henry.
What does he do?
Uh-uh-uh! He has lunch with
an old chum at the Home Office.
Old chum in the Home Office
then has a whisper in the ear
of someone on the fraud squad.
Someone on the fraud squad,
next thing you know,
sends down Fields and co.
into this manor.
Fisher´s ecstatic because now
he´s able to do a favor
to somebody by helping to nail,
nail Duncan Spellar,
a scruffy tycoon
who won´t even wear a tie.
Well, if Spellar´s aboveboard,
he´s all right,
and if he´s not,
it´s bad luck, isn´t it?
Hm.
After all, what´s your
saying about businessmen?
"Deal goes right,
open the champagne..."
"Deal goes wrong,
open prison," I know.
You see,
I just get the feeling
that what Fields is up to,
I think, is entrapment.
They´re going to provoke
Duncan Spellar
into committing a crime,
and when he does,
they´ll break him
with it.
It´s a pretty grey area.
I know what´s going on.
You have got a soft spot
for Duncan Spellar because
he likes your pies.
Nonsense.
Yes. You have these nice
little chats
about pastry,
marinating beef,
and you can´t entertain
the thought
that possibly he might not
be a good person.
Can you?
Margaret, get off.
You hate it when I´m right,
don´t you?
Oh, God, they´re here.
Henry, just do what
you think is right.
I´m not sure I know
what that is.
Yes, so, the Barnetts will
be coming at 7:30.
They usually sit
at table 4, there.
Mrs. Davie will be on
table 9,
and the Smiths usually
want number 1.
People get very possessive
about certain tables.
So we can put
the Spellar party here.
Yes, I´ll make sure that
they´re on table 3, yes.
And none of the staff know
anything about this, do they?
No.
Let´s keep it that way,
all right?
What time are they due
to arrive?
Uh, they´re --
They should be here
in about an hour, sir.
Let´s get on with it,
then.
And you, Pyke.
Wait a minute, what´s all this?
It´s in case we need
a man out here.
No, it´s out of the question.
I can do
the biz, sir.
Silver service, flambée,
the lot.
Over my dead body.
Henderson!
Testing, testing.
Testing.
Testing.
Testing.
Enderby?
That´s fine.
Think you´d better
go now.
My chef will be here
any minute.
Jawohl.
Okay, Pyke?
A-one up here, gov.
I´ve got a feeling we´re going
to stitch him up rotten tonight.
What about
this pasta, then?
Oh, no chance today.
Henderson didn´t show up
with those pumpkins.
Give his number another go,
would you, Steve?
Margaret?
Can you try and get that fella
out of the bedroom
for a couple of minutes?
How am I
supposed to do that?
You´ll think of something --
Whoa, whoa!
And jiggle the receiver
on the phone
a couple of times
when you´ve done it, all right?
Look, uh...
Could I have a few moments
in here to get changed?
What?
I have to get changed.
There won´t be any customers
down there for half an hour.
Okey-dokey.
Mr. Crabbe, I don´t see --
What the hell´s that?
Pyke?
What´s going on in there?
Uh, nothing, chief.
Spellar´s here.
And here come the other two.
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Tubbs, can I introduce you
to Duncan Spellar?
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
Sit, sit.
We´re off.
We´re getting nothing
down here.
Are they at
the right table?
Yeah, definitely.
What the bloody hell´s
going on, Enderby?
There´s three mics
on that table.
They can´t all
have gone pear-shaped.
You must have
the steak and kidney pie.
It´s the specialité
de la maison.
Splendid.
And a bottle of decent claret
to wash it down, hm?
I´m starving.
Me, too.
Woman, over static:
What are you going to have?
I´m not sure.
Thank God for that.
It´s all right, Dave.
Panic over, we´ve got ´em.
The soup
sounds good.
"We have
the technology."
I´m glad to have the opportunity
of this little chat, Spellar.
Mr. Tubbs
is a great believer
in the informal
approach.
Me, too.
Could we have
another minute, please?
You know why I´m
so hungry, don´t you?
It´s all those calories
I burnt off this afternoon.
Oh, I know -- twice.
You´re just so
incredible, darling.
It just gets better
and better,
doesn´t it,
sweetheart?
Give me a kiss.
You randy old thing.
Dave, what are they doing?
We´re getting snogging
down here.
What do you mean, snogging?
They´re just talking.
All very polite.
Oh, no, wait a minute,
there´s this couple
on the table next-door.
I told you
to stay out of here.
There´s been a cock-up.
We´ve got to get a mic
on that table.
Who´s that?
Just go make sure that order
ends up on the right table.
Uh...
I´ll explain later.
I think I detect a slight
wobble in your table, sir.
Are you sure
this is the ´85?
Show me the label.
My apologies.
Will you be wanting English
mustard or whole grain...
I said, you brought me the ´87,
when I ordered the ´85!
What on earth
do you think you´re doing?
It´s this table again,
I´m afraid.
What?
There we are.
Bon appetit, madame,
monsieur.
Look here, I want to know
what´s going on.
Keep your hair on.
Mr. Crabbe, hiring new staff
just like that?
Calm down, John, I´m not
hiring any new staff.
That´s
enough of that!
It´s all right, Steve.
Let him go.
John, Linda,
go back to work.
Everything
is under control.
So, you´re really set on
this British Rail franchise?
Of course -- I´ve made
no secret of it.
You´re on the committee,
you´ve read my application.
Yes, I think what Mr. Tubbs
wants to know here is
precisely how keen
you are.
All right.
I´d do anything
to win that franchise.
That´s how keen I am.
Tubbs, laughing: Anything
within law, of course.
Let´s just say anything.
Now we´re cooking.
Yes, I think what Mr. Tubbs
is saying here
is that...
there´s an element missing
from your application.
A, um...
personal element.
Let´s not beat
around the bush.
Oi! I´ve got
a delivery to make!
What now, for God´s sake!
You´re talking about some way
in which I could encourage you
to use your influence
on the committee, hmm?
You might suggest that,
Mr. Tubbs never would.
All right,
I wish to suggest...
Come on, I know
you´re inside there!
Look, just sod off,
will ya?
Not until you move
your poxy van!
Get him out of here!
Spellar´s going for it!
What´s going on in there,
anyway?
Let´s say
I was to suggest...
an arrangement whereby...
an arrangement whereby
a certain sum of money...
Yes?
Yes?
Are you all right?
Yes. Put the rest of this meal
into a bag for Oscar,
would you, dear?
Hello, Henry.
You were going
to the gents´?
I wasn´t,
actually.
Up the stairs, through
the door marked "private,"
second door on the right --
don´t forget.
I ordered the ´85,
you know.
Yes, well, John tells me
you ordered the ´87,
and frankly,
I´d rather believe him.
So...
This meal is on the house,
but not this bottle,
which, incidentally, is much
nicer than the ´85,
and I shall share this with
my staff in the kitchen.
And I´d rather
you never came here again.
But not you, Mrs. Barnett,
you´re always welcome.
Thank you, Mr. Crabbe.
How sweet.
Have you decided yet,
madame?
No.
I think we´ll need
another day or two.
I´ll fetch another napkin,
sir.
Where´s Spellar, Pyke?
I repeat --
do you know where Spellar is?
I don´t know, there was
some sort of ruckus.
It looked like this old biddy
had popped her clogs.
I repeat --
do you know where Spellar is?!
Uh, yeah, I do, actually.
Find it all right?
Yes, I did.
Thanks.
Is this geezer
one of yours, Crabbe?
Oh, Anderson.
And about time, too.
Where are my pumpkins?
Of course, I realized very soon
what Tubbs was up to.
Can you hear me, Crabbe?
Using his influence
as an MP to pursue
a political vendetta
against Duncan Spellar.
He knew very well
the publicity alone
would be enough
to discourage Spellar.
An innocent man,
after all.
I dare say there would
have been some, uh,
difficult questions
for you to answer, Crabbe.
Difficult questions
for me to answer, sir?
With you working with
Fields and his team.
It was on your premises
that Spellar was first
introduced to Tubbs.
As it happens...
Spellar´s
a reasonable man.
I´ve established
a relationship there, I think.
Anyway, I persuaded him
not to lodge a complaint
where you´re concerned.
Isn´t there a still-life
by Braque
with an egg that color
in it, sir?
Did you hear what I
was saying, Crabbe?
Uh, yes, sir.
And I´m most grateful.
Thank heavens, you realized
what was going on.
Who was it said that
to do the right thing
while appearing to do
the wrong thing
was the sign
of true leadership?
Well,
if you´ll excuse me,
I´ve got to try
a new pasta, sir.
So, what did Fisher say?
Oh, he was singing
your praises.
He said, "Duncan Spellar...
is an innocent man,
after all."
There we go.
Look at that.
Pumpkin ravioli.
Brilliant.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you
an innocent man.
Hear, hear!
Cheers!
