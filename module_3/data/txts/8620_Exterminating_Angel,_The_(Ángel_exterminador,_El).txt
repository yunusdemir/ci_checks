THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL
Providence Street
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a stroll.
Now? We have 20 guests for dinner.
I forgot that, but I promise
I'll be back soon.
- You are going nowhere.
- Please let me go.
All right, but don't bother
coming back.
Lucas has quit.
Has he been arguing with you?
No. He didn't tell us he was leaving.
We got on well together.
He's a nice man.
If he was not happy,
it's a good thing he's gone.
Well, there are plenty more
like Lucas about.
Maybe there's a woman involved.
Camila, what shall we do?
Please yourself, but I simply
must go out.
That's how I feel, but where
can we go at this hour?
And the weather's so awful.
One of my friends will put us up.
I'm taking a taxi, I could
drop you off.
You'll wait for me.
The caviar?
Madam wants the main dish
to be served first.
- And I've got to do it.
- Because you're a clown.
Lucas isn't here. Your coats
will be taken upstairs.
- Do you hear anything?
- They've gone upstairs.
We shouldn't leave like this.
You should have thought
of that before.
Let's go.
No, I've never tried it.
Our youngest colonel, yet you
have no taste for heroism?
I dread the noise of guns, Blanca.
What of your country?
It's a network of rivers
flowing into the sea.
- The sea is death.
- Death for one's country.
Alvaro, Edmundo wishes to speak.
To the wonderful evening
given to us by Silvia...
...with her magnificent
virgin bride of Lammermoor.
Bride, perhaps... but virgin?
- A title more appropriate to "Valkyrie"
- "Valkyrie"?
My name for Leticia.
She's ferocious and a virgin.
Are you sure she's virgin?
They say she preserves it -
a perversion, perhaps.
To the wonderful evening
given to us by Silvia...
...with her magnificent
virgin bride of Lammermoor.
I've taken the liberty
of varying the menu
The hors-d'oeuvre will be a Maltese
dish, which is good for the appetite.
It's made of liver, honey, almonds
and a piquant sauce.
Delicious! I had it when.
I conducted in Capri.
Right on cue, just as in the theatre.
Wonderful, Lucia!
That was really unexpected!
Lucia has a flair
for such chic surprises!
I'm not in the least bit amused.
I'm just in time.
Don't let him loose.
Mr Russell doesn't like jokes,
put him in the garden.
I think madam is wise.
There are other problems, too.
- What's wrong?
- Odd things are happening.
If madam will come with me...
- And the sheep, madam?
- Put them in the garden, too.
- Where are you going?
- Madam...
Are you leaving, too, Pablo?
I must see my poor sister,
madam.
Why? Is she ill?
She felt unwell this morning.
Ridiculous! This is an insult
to my guests.
Everything is ready to be served,
madam.
God, give me patience!
Have you been unhappy here?
On the contrary, a very happy
five years, madam.
- So?
- Forgive me.
- And where are you going?
- I'm going with Pablo.
- We'll be back in the morning.
- Consider yourselves dismissed.
I would like to be of service
to madam.
Please forgive us.
Excuse me.
No doubt they planned this.
Why?
Servants become more impertinent
every day.
Continue serving with the footmen.
I'm relying on you.
- What about our things?
- We'll come back for them tomorrow.
They won't let us in.
I'm taking my suitcase now.
A passing Jew.
No, it was "Valkyrie"
A fascinating woman.
- What is your name?
- Beatriz. And yours?
Eduardo.
- Age?
- Thirty.
- Profession?
- Architect.
- Single?
- Until Saturday, like you.
Five more days.
I ate with real appetite tonight,
doctor.
Your treatment has transformed me.
Not at all.
Your ailments are not serious.
- Do you dance?
- I've never tried.
A pity. I would love to be
in your arms.
I'm flattered that my patient
is so pleased with me.
- Transference.
- I've long wanted to satisfy that desire.
Did you bring your pills?
- What's the matter?
- It's nothing, doctor.
With your ulcer you shouldn't
eat so much.
May I present an old friend of mine?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.
- Blanca is playing for us.
- We'll be back in a minute.
Why did she kiss you so passionately?
Poor Leonora, how is her cancer?
Any hope?
None. I give her three months
to total baldness.
A good skull.
- Leandro!
- My dear Cristián.
It's so nice to see you.
I thought you were still in New York.
- I turn up like a bad penny.
- We must get together.
We must arrange one of our
special entertainments.
Careful, we're not alone.
May I present Mr Russell?
Don't bother.
Continue to present each other.
Besides, it's all Greek to me.
Excuse me.
- That Russell is eccentric.
- He must be a man of letters. Too bad!
Shall we go and listen to Blanca?
Bravo! Well done!
- Magnificent!
- An exquisite performance.
How superb it would be
with a harpsichord.
Now something by Scarlatti, I beg you.
Excuse me, but it's late and I'm tired.
But it's the most intimate,
agreeable moment of our evening.
- You've been wonderful, Blanca.
- Was it Paradisi?
Exquisite!
So, the great conductor is one of us.
I'm happy to make your acquaintance...
so fraternally.
- Which lodge?
- Dawn Twenty-one.
Sublime column.
Maestro, what do you think
of the pizzicato we've just heard?
Sonata, sir, sonata.
May I introduce you? Señor Ugalde,
this is...
- Leandro Gómez.
- Nice to meet you.
- Will you stay long?
- Will you?
- You first.
- No, you.
- I live here.
- Just as I thought.
- Time for the coats.
- Yes, sir.
Please excuse him. He felt
rejuvenated this evening.
He drank a little, and he's tired.
One cannot but admire his stamina
on the rostrum.
How can he sustain
such demanding activity?
Well, after the concert
he even tried to...
I've nothing to complain about.
I even have to restrain him.
Let him sleep. He may try again here!
My goodness, I don't think
he would do that here.
Of course not.
I expressed myself badly.
She's a little tired. It's only
natural in her condition.
Congratulations. Drowsiness
is a good sign.
- Your fourth child?
- I've lost count.
- Are you sure you're the father?
- You'd better ask her.
Science will decide.
I thought you'd gone.
Raul is telling us about
the fauna of Romania.
The climate, you see...
I really must go now.
Where is my shawl?
Just a second.
They won't go. It's nearly four.
They'll go soon. Then you
can slip up to my room.
Your husband?
If he finds you, I'll say I wanted
to show you my incunabula.
Good idea.
Thank you so much.
It went well, in spite of...
It's late, and your lipstick
is fading.
We must look after our friends.
They are feeling cooped-up.
I enjoy the spontaneity
of this situation.
If you care to spend
the night here...
...we will have rooms prepared
for you.
I'm glad to see that the spirit
of improvisation still survives.
You are the perfect host, but we
must not abuse your hospitality.
I have a rehearsal tomorrow.
And I have an appointment...
in only four hours time.
Now they're turning out the lights.
We must make a decision.
We must leave.
If the others are drunk or mad
they can stay.
This is outrageous!
If I weren't a guest here...
...I'd teach that lout a lesson.
These clothes may suit statues,
but not men at 5am.
Isn't that going a bit too far?
Don't forget that he's lived
in the United States.
It's warm, and the body
is most exhausted at this hour.
They will be ashamed when they
recall their conduct.
Certainly, and I wish to spare them
embarrassment.
Let us go to their level, to mitigate
their conduct a little.
Please, Lucia, sit here.
Our first night together.
But why are we here?
Why haven't we left?
Because everyone decided to stay.
Is that normal?
Life is amusing... and strange.
I can hardly keep awake.
Come... Let's sleep.
- Did you sleep well?
- I didn't wake once.
For me it was worse than
the Nice Express derailment.
You were in a derailment?
Fascinating!
You should see yourself!
I'm bewildered. What's going on?
How could this happen to us?
It's a bit much.
We must offer them breakfast,
then they'll go home.
I hope so. I'm relying
on their discretion.
I was quite shocked.
A third-class carriage was squashed
like a concertina.
And inside, what carnage!
The sight didn't upset me.
I must be insensitive.
I'm hungry.
Yet you fainted at the bier
of Prince Lourcat.
No comparison!
How could one be insensitive
to his grandeur in death?
He had such a noble profile.
Don't they eat breakfast here?
I think the lower orders are
insensitive to suffering.
Have you ever seen a wounded bull?
It's impassive.
I'm going to tidy myself. We look
horrible, but it's amusing.
Did you sleep well?
I must look awful. Why stare at me,
dear sister?
You are more interesting than ever -
unkemptness becomes you.
I must look awful.
Why are you staring at me?
You are more interesting than ever -
unkemptness becomes you.
What sharp ears!
After a bad night,
he lost consciousness at dawn.
You should have told me.
He must be put to bed.
It's better not move him. We'll do
what we can for him here.
- Keep him warm.
- I thought he was looking odd at dinner.
It may not be anything serious,
it's not the first time.
- How is he?
- Almost totally bald.
- I don't understand.
- He only has a few hours to live.
And your prognoses are never wrong.
- I don't feel very well, either.
- It's nothing.
Julio, do your best to provide
breakfast for our guests.
It's very early,
the tradesmen haven't delivered yet.
- Not even the milkman?
- Not even him. It's really odd.
Bring the cold meat from dinner
and some hot coffee.
Lucia, where could we freshen up
a little?
I should have attended to that
earlier. Come to my room.
I bet they won't go.
You see? What do you make
of this situation?
I don't know. It's uncommon,
or perhaps only too common.
No one seems to behave logically.
Why didn't you and your fiancée
leave?
I don't know... like everyone else...
and you?
I don't know.
That's what bothers me.
Not one of us has made
the slightest effort to go home.
Why? Was it natural for us
to spend the night here...
...against the elementary rules
of etiquette?
Have we become a gypsy encampment?
I think it's very original.
I love things out of the ordinary.
I don't like it. But I said nothing,
out of politeness.
Come, gentlemen, let's not exaggerate.
We were enchanted by the music,
the conversation...
It's not a cause for surprise.
My feet are swollen.
May I ask our charming Lucia...
...why serve breakfast here,
instead of in the dining room?
Well, doctor, since we're all here.
I thought...
The doctor loves to play.
Sherlock Holmes, doesn't he?
My husband and children must be
worried. I'm going home.
We'll go with you.
This is all so absurd.
- Are you coming, Rita?
- Isn't it rather early to go out?
We must see our children off
to school.
My children study at home
with their tutor, Abbé Samson.
I think he is something of a saint.
Even my husband says...
Isn't it true, Cristián?
Madam, this is no time to prattle
about priests... Let's go.
Excuse me.
What have we got to lose
by drinking coffee?
I can't smoke on an empty stomach.
I'd like some, too.
Will you join us, Blanca?
This is excessive.
I find this atmosphere
almost hysterical.
It's not the first time that.
I've breakfasted at a party.
Lucia, I'm afraid there are
no sugar spoons.
I'm sorry, the butler has no help.
- Julio, the sugar spoons.
- Yes, madam.
May I get you something, gentlemen?
Some coffee?
No, Julio. Just do as you were told.
I think I should attend until
breakfast is completed.
Didn't you hear me ask you
to fetch sugar spoons?
- I merely thought...
- Do as I asked.
What's the matter?
Do you feel unwell?
Blanca, what's wrong? Can I help you?
What's your opinion of all this?
The butler's strange disobedience
confirms my observations.
No matter how we try,
we cannot leave this room.
What's going on?
A man is very ill!
- How is he, doctor?
- Bluntly, he is in a coma.
If only I had some heart stimulants.
Cristián, we need to make an effort
and put and end to this apathy.
We must get Mr Russell out of here.
He urgently needs proper
medical facilities.
The doctor is right.
We must make an effort.
Who will dare to take him?
Why don't you do it? You know
we'll all follow you.
It's useless.
We're lost. Why did you
bring me here, dear sister?
Don't be cruel. It was you
who made me come here.
Calm down...
There's no water.
Isn't there any coffee left?
I'm dying of thirst.
Madam must excuse me,
but there's not a drop left.
This can't be bad. A squeeze
of lemon will improve the taste.
Thank you, Eduardo,
but I'd rather wait.
I don't understand,
there must be a solution.
Look at me.
We haven't gone mad, have we?
Everyone's forgotten us. We've been
here for 24 hours. We're lost.
That's what worries me most.
What's the matter?
Why don't people come...
Unless everyone's dead
and we're the only survivors.
- Why don't they come for us?
- Calm down.
Shut up!
- I'm breaking the window.
- Use the door.
There's a connection between this
and the servants leaving.
Gentlemen, please.
Let's not be alarmist. The servants
must have had their reasons.
Like rats when they leave
a sinking ship.
May I just say...
I think they left for no reason.
They were all happy until
shortly before you arrived.
In short, there's no explanation.
It's extraordinary.
We must keep calm, there's
nothing worse than panic.
A situation like this
can't last forever.
We're not spellbound, this isn't
a sorcerer's castle.
We will only overcome our plight
by cold analysis.
I propose...
...that we should all concentrate,
make a supreme effort...
...be determined to get out of here,
to succeed...
Shut up, Nobile.
You're responsible for all this.
We're all victims of a joke
that's in very bad taste.
I, my dear friend? Because.
I invited you to dinner?
- Because I opened my door?
- Exactly!
You invited each of us
to dine here
"Would you do me the honour... "
et cetera.
We'd rather have slept at home,
or in a brothel. Anywhere!
Why did you extend
that strange invitation?
Strange? But you were all delighted.
You yourself said
how happy you were.
Then I correct myself. One person
caused this degradation - you!
Me? You've lost your wits.
Edmundo is right.
You're nothing but a fool.
If you weren't a lady...
The water didn't seem to harm
the butler.
- I've got a headache.
- No, Blanca, don't.
Can't these men do anything?
They bicker like tarts.
Silvia, find a way for us
to get out of this hole.
Don't be offended. He's more
sensitive than a young girl.
I'm sure this situation upsets him
more than it does us.
Don't make me worse!
I don't want to hear anyone.
I want to be alone.
I'm content. I won't see
the extermination.
I wouldn't mind dying, but not
among people, like this.
I want the chance to be alone
with you.
What hope have we got to be alone?
There is a way we can isolate
ourselves from the others.
I don't see how.
I'll tell you when they're asleep,
if they ever decide to sleep.
I lifted the lid and saw a precipice
and a raging torrent.
As I sat down an eagle flew by
below me.
The wind blew dead leaves
in my face.
I'm cold.
Consumatum est.
Just what we need! It would be better
if we evaporated when we died.
This corpse will demoralise them.
Why didn't the old man die?
What's one conductor, more or less?
What shall we do?
- Were you seen?
- I don't know. I don't care.
- Here it flows into the sea.
- I can't reach.
Keep descending.
Already the horrible, fixed grin.
My love.
My death.
Oh, my enclosure!
Still nothing.
- What do you suggest?
- This can't go on forever.
Three days ago the mayor
tried to establish contact.
He wanted to give them instructions
by loudspeaker, if any are still alive.
But I made him see the absurdity
of the idea.
It strikes me as a good idea.
But there's a simpler way. Why not
enter the house? No one's done that.
Yesterday we ordered a brigade
of sappers to enter.
At nightfall they returned
to the barracks defeated.
- Did they try to enter?
- No, that's the worst of it.
- Let us go in! We're not animals.
- Clear off!
Why is it taking so long?
It's easy.
What's wrong?
- Me first. I'm feverish.
- Me, too.
Wait your turn.
You stepped on my foot!
Must you wear shoes?
Why is it taking so long?
Maybe the water has been cut off.
You could help them.
Excuse me.
Move away! Women first!
Get in line. Drink only
one glassful now.
It will be dangerous to drink
too much at first.
Drink in moderation.
- Women first! Didn't you hear?
- Here, drink up.
I won't let you brutalise my brother!
How nice and fresh.
Hungry... I'm hungry.
Don't eat! Don't leave me alone!
He's gone two days without speaking.
He's oblivious to everyone, even me.
And you say it isn't serious?
It isn't. He's suffering no more
than we are.
He may feel the effects more
because of his age.
My hands are like dead twigs.
We might be better off without water.
We'll only prolong our agony
by drinking it.
- What are you eating?
- Paper. It helps to stave off hunger.
- It's nauseating.
- The taste isn't disagreeable.
We used to eat it at school.
The lessons bored us.
My teachers were Jesuits,
good people.
We were bored, like most children.
I know that paper is made
from softwood trees.
It can't harm you.
Would you care to try it?
- Julio, come here.
- Excuse me.
- Put this cloth around it.
- Don't go! Don't leave me alone!
Prince! Save me! Our pact!
I can't stand it anymore!
I can't bear the way that harpy
combs her hair! I hate her!
Better hunger and thirst than her!
Why not comb it properly?
Like that, you see!
Comb it right through!
We are fed up with your odd habits.
Sorry to bother you, Beatriz.
Have you seen a silver box
containing pills?
A silver box? No, I'm sorry.
They're my husband's pills. We used
to take great care of them but...
...now we're all feeling a bit...
I'll look for them.
I'm hungry.
By any chance, is there
a lump of sugar?
I'm sorry, madam, but there's
been nothing for two days.
Are you feeling better? Someone
will find the box, you'll see.
Doubtless someone has it,
but wants to see me suffer.
Don't say that.
You know, I wonder...
I wonder what they're doing.
I think of them all the time.
I never forget them, either.
Our poor children.
My only consolation is that
the Abbé will care for them.
The Abbé! I'm worried that they're
at the mercy of that hypocrite.
- That's unjust.
- Admit he chases after you.
- I won't say more.
- Go on, say more!
Are you interested?
You and your marital problems
mean nothing to me.
You're insolent! I thought so
as soon as I saw you!
I don't care. I've nothing
but contempt for you.
Gentlemen, we are all
in the same boat.
We'll all gain by treating
each other considerately.
- You'd better keep quiet.
- That's right.
It's cynical to give advice
to your victims.
My victims? What do you mean?
I'd be relieved to hear
of some good reason...
I'm tired of explaining.
Come with me, don't say anymore.
Don't make them more irritable.
Sit down.
Sit down with me, please.
My friend, I'd give my life
to remedy this situation.
I am appalled by suffering. I've
always tried to help the needy.
How could they possibly believe
that I...
Calm down.
Alvaro, I'm so hungry.
Think of a way to get us out.
Only a miracle can free us.
Why don't we all pray together?
We have made a solemn vow.
If Divine Providence frees us
we will offer a Te Deum.
That frightful smell.
It's unbearable!
We're trying to contain it.
Don't go! Don't leave me alone!
I'm so cold.
I'm so cold.
Blanca, remember what I told you
about your hair.
Doctor?
What can we do? She's suffering
so much, poor thing.
I can't stand it.
Why don't you kill me and end it all?
Don't be silly. You had a good night.
We need analgesics as much
as we need food.
We haven't even an aspirin.
Don't leave me, doctor.
I feel better when you're near.
If we ever get out of this trap.
I'll go to Lourdes.
- Promise that you will come with me.
- I promise.
We'll humble ourselves
at the Virgin's feet...
...for only she can get us out of here.
Don't talk so much. It won't help
if you get excited.
When we are at Lourdes...
...you must buy me a washable
rubber Virgin.
You will, won't you?
Are these yours?
We call this room
"The Paradise of Thebes"
A few friends gather here
to pass unforgettable hours.
Why didn't you show me before?
In these circumstances, just imagine
if the others knew.
What was for pleasure
can now relieve pain.
Laudanum, codeine and morphine.
Morphine? Where?
- What is it?
- It's none of your business.
What has he got hidden there?
You'll sample it
when everyone is asleep.
- I'm hungry.
- Silence.
This is too much,
show some respect.
- You smell like a hyena!
- What?
Like a hyena, madam!
How dare you? Why insult me?
Shame on you for mentioning what
we have the dignity to ignore.
It's the truth. She stinks,
like you, I, and everyone!
We live in a pigsty, like real pigs.
You all disgust me. I hate you!
Take no notice, he's hypersensitive.
This will end badly, my dear.
What I've always hated most -
coarseness, violence and filth.
They're now our inseparable
companions.
Death is preferable
to this abject promiscuity.
Lord Elohim, be with me.
The empire of witchcraft
is assembled here.
Before I die, divine Lord...
...come! come! come!
What have you done?
Have you lost your mind?
- Tie her hands up.
- Take her away at once!
Call an ambulance.
She's feverish. Put cold compresses
on her forehead.
Don't cry, it's over. They'll take turns
to ensure nothing happens to you.
- It's nauseating.
- But it will kill the pain.
- What day is it?
- What?
We've been here over a month,
haven't we?
Not yet. We'd have died of hunger
before now.
I feel we've always been here.
I feel the same way.
And we'll always be here.
Unless...
Unless we escape together,
lose ourselves in the shadows.
You don't answer.
Where you go, I'll follow.
- Look, it's just what we thought.
- Yes.
What's that?
- What's the problem now?
- Be quiet!
Who stepped on my hand?
- What's the matter?
- I may have dreamt it.
I'm not blind, sir!
- What are you talking about?
- You behave like an incubus!
Please, don't be ridiculous.
Watch your tongue!
- Calm down, gentlemen.
- What's the matter?
The colonel took advantage
of the dark, like a thief!
You swine! Enough of this!
I challenge you to a duel!
- I accept!
- A madhouse! One can't even sleep.
Nobile's at the centre of it all,
it's another of his schemes.
Don't you see
he's got an upset stomach?
This is madness. Calm down
and talk reasonably.
Anything but physical violence!
It's not like us!
Remember your upbringing,
remember who you are.
I'd like to know if Nobile
provoked this.
We'll show him he can't play with us.
I prefer not to answer, gentlemen.
There's a limit to our patience.
Rita, try to pacify him.
I'll never forget how
you've ridiculed me.
- I'd rather have food than fighting.
- Leave me alone!
How could you?
Even the strongest
are losing their heads.
Have pity on me.
Cristián, please,
every problem has a solution.
I beg your pardon,
yours and everyone's.
I was out of my mind.
I was not myself.
Please forgive me, madam.
May I make a suggestion which.
I hope you will approve of?
To avoid lamentable brushes
in future...
...ladies should sleep on one side
of the room, men on the other.
Remember you are speaking
to gentlemen!
He's a degenerate. He enjoys
insulting us.
- Edmundo is right.
- I just thought...
Don't try anymore,
can't you see that...?
Thank you.
Remember now, behave yourselves.
Let's go.
- Where are you going?
- They're Ugalde's children.
We're going to look at the house,
their parents are inside.
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.
I'm sure I can go in and talk to them,
if they're still alive.
- Are you sure?
- I'll show you.
Won't you let me? Then I'll tell
the Press!
I need to be listened to,
I'm sure I can solve this business!
Another maniac.
Go on, Johnny, don't stop.
- Why have you stopped?
- Go on, Johnny?
- He must not stop.
- Keep going, child!
Why run back?
You can't trust children!
- Come on, try again!
- No, let's go.
So as not to fall into total apathy...
...we must keep the place
clean and tidy.
We'll organise cleaning teams.
How are you?
- All right, except for my head.
- You poor thing.
If it weren't for him and Leticia,
they'd act like savages.
I'll never forget their defence of you.
I had a presentiment before going
to the opera that night.
I heard a voice insisting:
"Take the keys, take the keys"
The keys?
In the cabala, a key is anything
which opens the doors of the unknown.
Now, Blanca, hold that firmly.
Like this.
And you, Silvia, the other one,
like this.
Victim!
I can't feel anything,
we need innocent blood.
We must await the sacrifice
of the last sheep.
- What's the matter?
- Look!
In the cupboard...
Listen everyone...
- What's the matter?
- It's over.
Eduardo, Beatriz...
Doctor, in there!
What's going on?
Leandro, Colonel, help me.
Keep everybody away.
Let me see, Alvaro.
- How did they do it?
- It doesn't matter. Back off.
They slit their wrists.
What's so funny?
I was thinking...
...what if I pushed you into
the other room?
I'd kill you.
What does that mean?
They've lost whatever reason
they had.
It's a Masonic call for help.
They must go to each other's aid.
But here... unless, of course,
the bear...
Cristián, the time has come
to speak the unutterable word.
C... H... I... H... H... O... H
Shut the windows!
Save yourselves!
They're coming in their millions!
- It's late, my boy. Off to bed.
- I'm not sleepy.
- So many people!
- He died in mortal sin.
My dear child!
I shall never see you again!
Look, at the summit!
Can you see him?
- The Pope!
- Yes, it is.
So solemn and majestic,
like a warrior.
I'll tuck you in.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night, Mum.
Nothing! The same as usual,
like a tomb.
- Why the quarantine flag?
- It could be an epidemic.
- Typhus would be better than this.
- Pablo!
What brings you here?
The same as you, to see
if there's any news.
- Maybe they're all dead.
- You think so?
Sometimes you can smell the stench
from here.
Perhaps it's the food rotting
in the kitchen.
Don't shoot! No, don't kill it, please!
It's quite tame. I work here.
The cook and the maids...
- You told them we were coming?
- I've not said a word.
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.
Let's find out.
Perhaps they've heard some news.
Raul says we'll be free
if Nobile dies.
Dead spiders spin no webs.
If he had any dignity he'd know
what to do.
He's hiding with Leticia.
Stop that! It's the most decent
thing you could do.
Speak up, gentlemen. Let's all
hear your plotting.
We want to get rid of him.
Are you mad? That's completely
irrational.
We don't want reason,
we want to get out.
- If you're looking for a fight...
- Alvaro, stand aside!
- We've nothing against you two.
- We're justified by necessity.
- Kill him!
- Better late than never!
- Listen, fools!
- Kill the doctor, too.
Why is he trying to stop us?
Think of the terrible consequences
of your actions.
This won't be the last vile act.
It means the disintegration
of human dignity. It's bestial.
Stand aside, or I won't answer
for your safety.
Enough of talking!
Get him!
- That's enough, Raul!
- You stay out of this!
Look, it's Nobile!
There's no need for violence. You can
have what you want easily.
Thank you, Leticia.
Just a moment. Stand still.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
Yes, now I know.
It's really extraordinary.
How long have we been here?
I've lost track of time.
Think how often we've changed
positions during...
...this terrible eternity.
It's like a chess game.
We have made thousands of moves.
We've even moved the furniture
hundreds of times.
Yet now everything is
just as it was then...
...people and furniture...
...the scene as it was that night.
Is it another hallucination,
or is it true? Tell me, Alvaro.
- Tell me!
- It's true.
I was here and you were beside me,
weren't you?
And I was sitting here.
We sat here and I held
your hand in mine.
- Who remembers?
- After dinner I sat at the piano.
- You were there.
- It's true!
That's all very well,
but what's the point?
Can you remember what you played?
Perfectly.
The last piece I played
was a Paradisi sonata.
Play it again. Just the end.
Go on, play it!
Play it.
You stood behind me. Go on, get up.
You were clapping.
You rose from the piano,
someone came up to you.
Who spoke first?
Make an effort!
Try to remember!
An exquisite performance.
Answer. What would you have replied?
Yes, yes.
I'm sorry we have no harpsichord
for you.
How superb it would be
with a harpsichord.
Now something by Scarlatti,
I beg you.
It's late, isn't it?
It's three o'clock.
Excuse me, but it's late
and I'm tired.
We're all tired and we want
to go home, don't we?
Let's go, then! Come on, follow me!
Follow me!
This way!
- It's good. Brandy from the house?
- My last bottle
Look! There's light!
Camila, come here.
Look, the light's on.
- It's them.
- My goodness!
- Let's go in.
- After you.
Why not wait for the faithful
to leave?
- Wait? Why?
- Well...
- Father...
- Yes?
Something's wrong.
- Let's wait a moment.
- A good idea.
I've forgotten my missal.
- Why are they not leaving?
- Let me through.
I'll explain.
- You go first.
- I'm in no hurry.
What's going on? Let's go.
The End.
