I understand, yes.
Thank you so much, Mr. Jeffries.
Thank you.
You'll have the money
by the end of the day.
Let's go.
Phineas, hurry up.
We're gonna miss the train.
Stand up straight.
Wipe that muck off.
Pinkie up.
Arm extended, elbow out.
Sip, never slurp.
Pinkie in the air,
arm extended...
elbow out.
Keep your cup level.
Gently lower your cup.
Shall we do it again?
Pinkie in the air...
arm extended...
elbow out.
Gracefully.
Charity, come here.
Your dress.
Is this how
we've taught you to behave?
It's my fault, sir.
I made her laugh.
Well, thank you
for your honesty.
Stay away from my daughter.
How did you get out?
The window.
Father is sending me
to finishing school.
I don't know
what my future will be.
I do.

- Mr. Smith?
- Yes.
- Have a look at this.
- Of course.
Yes, yes, I see it.
Thank you,
Chalmers, that'll do.
Sir, Phineas Taylor Barnum.
If I may, sir...
I believe
I have skills and ideas
that go well beyond
punching numbers
into an adding machine.
Well, I've read about
this German fellow,
Lilienthal, I believe,
who's developed
a glider that can take
a man in the air, sir.
Isn't that amazing?
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,
it would be revolutionary.
Gentlemen!
Can I have your attention?
You're all dismissed.
Bankrupt?
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.
Yes, at the bottom
of the South China Sea.
Typhoon sank 'em all.
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!
Hey.
Oh, God! You're home early.
And until further notice.
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.
Or any job, apparently.
That's what makes our life
together so exciting.
Charity.
This isn't the life
I promised you.
But I have everything I want.
What about the magic?
What do you call
those two girls?
Hey, you partners, look who
moseyed into the corral.
Daddy!
- Come here!
- Did you bring a present?
A present for what?
- For my birthday!
- Your what?
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.
Okay, I do have a present...
but not just any present.
Oh, no.
The most amazing
birthday present ever.
This extraordinary machine
was originally created
by Leonardo da Vinci,
400 years ago.
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries
until just last week,
on a stormy night,
when a sunken pirate ship
washed up
on the shores of Nantucket.
They found skeletons
and treasures
and the blueprints
were recovered
by none other
than J. W. Mercantile.
The blueprints crossed my desk
very briefly
but I managed
to commit them to memory.
And if I have
remembered correctly...
Happy birthday, Caroline.
This is a wishing machine.
You tell it your wishes...
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.
Can I tell a wish?
Step right up. Go ahead.
I wish to marry Santa Claus.
That is a good wish.
I wish for ballet slippers.
Hey, that's a good wish, too.
What's your wish, Mommy?
I wish...
for happiness
like this forever
for you and you...
and for your father.
Boring!
Boring?
Since when has happiness
ever been boring?

The goat prices go up,
so the pork bellies go down.
- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?
This bank only wants
to lend money
to people with money.
What are you
looking at, flop-doodle?
Mr. Barnum.
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.
It's a good bet
is what it is, sir.
People don't
want to admit it...
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.
It's why we stare at it.
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.
Of course. I, uh,
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla
of trading vessels.
<i>Why would a
bank loan us $10,000?</i>
Because we put up collateral.
But, dear, we don't
have any collateral.
Sure we do.
In the South China Seas.
In the South China Seas?
Deep in the South China Seas.
And what did
we buy with this loan?
"Barnum's American Museum
of Curiosities."
What kind of museum is it?
A place to be transported.
A place where people
can see things
they've never seen before.
Huh?
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.
They're all the rage
in Europe. Look.
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.
Come here. See?
You've already met some of the
most famous folks in history.
But they're not all wax.
This is the great O'Malley.
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.
You don't look like a magician.
I'm a thief.
A very good thief.
I caught him nicking my watch.
- See?
- An elephant!
Not just any elephant.
I can get you
somethin' real nice.
Just say the word.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
This is a ten-ton bull
straight from
the plains of Africa.
And look at that.
The tallest giraffe
in the world.
Can I climb up its leg?
Absolutely not. Okay.
Now, I know how it looks.
If you didn't,
I'd be worried.
I mean, it just
needs a little work, but...
The loan has to be
paid back every month.
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.
It is one hour
of your time, sir,
but it will change your life.
We have shows
on the hour every hour.
I love your dress.
Surely not for
the faint of heart,
but I can tell
you're gonna love it.
Half price for anyone
who's wearing a hat.
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.
Load of garbage.
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.
Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone's special...
How many tickets?
- Three.
- Three.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Did you sell
any more tickets today?
A few. Yeah.
Most everyone was rushing home,
it's Friday,
but we sold a few.
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.
Do you?
She's right.
You need something alive.
Go to sleep, both of you.
Something sensational.
That's a big word.
It's your word.
Something that isn't stuffed.
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.
Unicorns aren't real.
<i>Well, mermaids
aren't real either.</i>
You must be Gertrude Stratton.
I'm looking for your son.
I don't have a son.
The hospital record says you do.
Charles, right? Age 22?
Charles!
Charles!
P.T. Barnum, at your service.
I am putting together a show
and I need a star.
You want people
to laugh at me.
Well, they're laughing
anyway, kid,
so might as well get paid.
I see a soldier,
no, a general
riding across the stage
with a sword and a gun,
and... and...
and the most beautiful uniform
ever made.
People will come
from all over the world,
and when they see him,
they won't laugh.
They'll salute.
How's it looking, girls?
Hey! You looking for freaks?
I know where
you can find one of them.
Really?
Come on, girls.
Hello.
Sir, you shouldn't
be here.
I'm sorry,
who's doing that singing?
It's you, isn't it?
Sir, I'll have
to ask you to leave.
You are so talented, blessed...
Extraordinary.
Unique.
I would even say beautiful.
Sir.
Please leave me alone.
They don't understand,
but they will.

This line is so...
Oh, my God! Oh, goodness.
Okay. Anne and W.D. Wheeler.
Brother and sister?
- Yes, sir.
- Terrific. And what do you do?
Trapeze.
Trapeze. Okay.
You know, people
aren't gonna like it
if you put us on the stage.
Oh, I'm counting on it.
Is this over your...
Entire body.
Terrific.
I don't need to see it.
Now. Yes!
Can I just ask
how heavy you are?
Do you have a number for that?
- I prefer not to say, but...
- Just between you and me.
500 pounds.
- 750 pounds, you said?
- 750 pounds, it is!
What is your name?
Vasily Palvos, sir.
Yeah, we're gonna
change that name.
Uh, I think you're Irish.
We have a show!
That's good,
but I need it five times bigger!
And I want it everywhere!

Peanuts. Get your peanuts here.
Hot, salted peanuts. Piping hot!
One for me, one for the lady.
O'Malley.
Ah, Mr. Bennett
from the <i>Herald.</i>
Come to take in
another show, huh?
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,
does it bother you
that everything
you're selling is fake?
Do these smiles seem fake?
It doesn't matter
where they come from.
The joy is real.
So, you are a philanthropist?
Well, hyperbole
isn't the worst crime.
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.
The creed of a true fraud.
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled
or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.
Now who's a fraud?
Oh, Mr. Bennett.
That word you used
to describe my show?
Has a nice ring to it.
And right this way.
Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?
Well, isn't that
what makes it fun?
Keep coming. Okay.
Are you ready?
- Is it?
- It is.
Come on. Let's go.
Push.
Wow.
Helen, that's for you.
And Caroline,
this is for you.
There's a ballet school
right down the street.
Just past your
parents' house, actually.
Don't tell me
you bought this house
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?
Well, that wasn't
the only reason.
This is the life I promised you.
Shall we?
Phin, it's beautiful,
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...
It only took me 25 years,
but welcome home,
Charity Barnum.
- Hello, there.
- There goes Barnum.
Hey, sweetheart, who's
that young man over there?
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.
A bit of a scandal, they say.
His last play
was a hit in London.
Play? You pay good money
to watch people stand around
and talk for two hours
and they call me a con man.
Ew, what's that smell?
Do you smell that?
Ew. Something does smell.
Oh, I know what it is.
Peanuts.
I can see it right now.
"Youngest prima ballerina
in the history
of the City Ballet."
I'm quitting.
What? Why would you quit?
I started too late.
I'll never catch up.
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.
What? You think
I can't spot talent?
Ballet takes years
of hard work.
It's not like the circus.
You can't just fake it.
She can't quit. No.
No, I mean, she just...
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.
Well, I should
certainly hope so.
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing
in the world to her right now.
She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.
She shouldn't have to.
New York society
will never accept us.
If they did,
they'd have to stop judging
and actually do something
with their lives.
This isn't about me.
Oh. So it's different
than everything else then?
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.
She is proud.
We don't have
to be the Carlyles.
Mr. Carlyle.
You produced this play?
Yes, I did indeed.
Refunds are available
at the front box office.
P.T. Barnum.
From the circus?
Yes. You... you've been?
God, no. But I have
seen the crowds.
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in.
Which is much more
than I can say for my play.
And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.
That's because
I'm selling virtue.
Can I buy you a drink?
I wanna go after
the carriage trade.
Present legitimate acts,
expand our appeal,
go after the snobs.
If you only knew
how suffocating they are.
So come join the circus.
You clearly have a flair
for show business.
Teach me how to appeal
to the highbrows.
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.
Why not?
Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable
admiring your show from afar.
Comfort, the enemy of progress.
Do you understand that
just associating with you
could cost me my inheritance?
Oh, it could cost you
more than that.
You'd be risking everything.
But, on the other hand, well,
you just might
find yourself a free man.

Who is that?
Hey, hey! No one's buying hats
back here. Get out front, go!
W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce
my newest hire,
Mr. Phillip Carlyle.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, pleasure.
And what is your act,
Mr. Carlyle?
I don't have an act.
Everyone's got an act.
Mr. Barnum!
Yeah.
You better come see this.
Phillip, keep up!
A bit of a nasty element.
There always is, isn't there?
Nothing draws a crowd
quite like a crowd.
We don't want you in our city!
Go home, you freaks!
Freaks!
"Shame of the city."
"The protests cement
Mr. Barnum's reputation
as a purveyor of the offensive
and indecent."
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.
No, I'm blushing.
What do you care
what Bennett thinks?
- He's a prig.
- And a snob.
Yeah, and all the snobs
in New York read him.
He does their thinking for them.
Whatever happened to
thriving off controversy?
Yeah, well...
Hey.
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- Phillip!
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Helen, come on.
"The Master of the Household
"has it in command
of the Queen
"to invite
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum
"and his theatrical troupe
to a reception
at Buckingham Palace."
The Queen Victoria?
Is this real?
I had to pull a few strings.
If you want society
to accept you,
you may as well start...
at the very, very top.
Are we all invited?
I guess I'll just
have to tell the Queen
that either all of us go...
or none of us will.
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.
Why aren't we in tails?
We're the entertainment.
Don't see you in a costume.
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum...
and his Oddities from America!
Is that real?
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.
And I've heard all about
your little colonel from
my friends in America.
General, ma'am.
You're even smaller
than I imagined.
Well, you're not exactly
reaching the top shelf
yourself, sweetheart.
That went well.
Your Majesty.
Phillip.
Miss Jenny Lind.
She is luminous.
Who's that?
The opera singer?
Singer, huh?
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.
She's sold out
La Scala a dozen times.
Not to mention
the French Opera.
Ah.
What are you doing?
Following you, so you can
introduce me to Miss Lind.
- Introduce you? I don't know her.
- Yeah.
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.
Miss Lind.
My name is Phillip Carlyle.
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...
Phineas Taylor Barnum.
The pleasure's mine.
Of course,
you are the American.
I believe I might
have heard of you.
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here
I must be doing something right.
That, or something very wrong.
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.
A showman, Miss Lind,
just a showman.
The best on my side
of the Atlantic.
Well, if you do
say so yourself.
I do, but I don't have to.
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?
No, he is one of the best.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind...
let me get to the point.
I'd like to bring you
to New York.
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer
not in Europe,
but in the entire world.
Mmm.
And have you heard me sing?
- Absolutely.
- No. No, I haven't.
But like mine,
your reputation precedes you,
and, well,
I trust your reputation
more than my own taste, so...
I've never been to America.
You will sing
in the grandest theater
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.
"Jenny Lind.
"One night only."
Or maybe two.
And at 20 percent of the gate,
it'll be a queen's ransom
for your efforts.
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.
To orphans and widows.
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."
That's brilliant.
I mean, the press
will go crazy for that story.
That's not a story.
May I ask you something,
Mr. Barnum?
Anything.
Why me?
People come to my show
for the pleasure
of being hoodwinked.
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.
Miss Lind.
Everyone is here.
Look at this.
Even the Winthrops.
Are you happy?
I will be if this works.
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.
What's taking her so long?
They're still
taking their seats.
- Speaking of which.
- Yeah?
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.
What?
Where should I put 'em?
Your box?
That box? No, no, no,
that's a bit visible.
Visible?
The acoustics are actually
better in the standing room.
That's where they should be.
Miss Lind's ready now.
Okay. Thank you, thank God!
This is so awesome.
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.
He's out of his element.
What is this about?
Is that Barnum?
This isn't the circus.
I recently had the privilege
of hearing the most
divine voice
I've ever heard.
Suddenly,
he's a connoisseur.
Now, I know that
sounds like Barnum Humbug...
but I have 100 bottles
of good champagne on ice
that says this isn't just
another sideshow novelty.
May I present...
the Swedish Nightingale...

Brava!

Wonderful!
Bravissima!
More!
Excellent!
Brava!
Encore!
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you!
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.
Yes, I'm studying ballet.
Are you?
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.
And what
about you, Helen?
You look like
a princess, ma'am.
I have to admit, Barnum...
she is remarkable.
Enough to bring joy to the most
joyless critic, isn't she?
Mmm. And in the hands of a
real purveyor of the arts,
she could be something in this country.
Shame,
she's fallen in with you.
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,
hard as that is to believe.
- Mr. Barnum...
- Yes.
- I'd love to meet Miss Lind.
- And you will meet Miss Lind.
- Would you introduce us?
- If you just give me a moment...
- Phineas.
- Yes.
You've...
done well.
Thank you.
Allow me to introduce you.
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.
I'd like you to meet
Charity's parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.
Ah, pleasure.
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.
Are these...
Yes, those are
your granddaughters.
Phineas, not here.
Not here?
You afraid I'm gonna
embarrass your parents
in front of their fancy friends?
I really don't think
I have that power.
An insignificant man like me
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.
Get out.
Well, Phineas...
I believe I told you
that free champagne
is a recipe for disaster.
Charity.
- Now would everyone please raise their glasses?
- Charity.
To Mr. Barnum...
who has shown
once and for all...
that a man's station
is limited only
by his imagination.
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.
To Mr. Barnum.
Thank you.
It's hard to understand
wealth and privilege
when you're born into it.
I sometimes don't feel
like I belong here.
You?
I was born out of wedlock...
and that brought
shame upon my family.
And life always
manages to remind me
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.
And that leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...
Lord, that lady can sing!
I know.
Think she likes a man
in uniform?
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?
You got a show
in an hour, okay?
That's enough time for us to have
at least three drinks, right?
Come on, let's go.
- No, no, no. Lettie!
- What?
It's very crowded in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling...
Guys!
Who's gonna pay admission
if you're out there
for all the world to see?
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!
Jenny, America
may not know it yet...
but they are going to love you.
To Miss Lind!

Why can't you just
put more shows in New York?
Why do you need
to tour the country?
Why did Napoleon
march on Russia?
Napoleon was defeated.
Napoleon didn't have
a 60-piece orchestra.
A 60-piece orchestra?
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.
We'll still have to board them.
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.
O'Malley, that's
Caroline's piggy bank.
- Custom sets? Fireworks?
- Yeah.
Inside theaters?
That's genius.
No. Hey, P.T...
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.
Yeah. I took out a loan.
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?
You're not gonna see
a penny of profit
until your 40th show...
41st, actually.
You're risking everything
you've built here.
How do you think I built it?
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.
- P.T.?
- What?
Your attention has been
divided long enough.
Our gate is down,
we have more
protesters every day.
You just need to get people
to come back.
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,
you haven't been
at the Barnum Museum."
They come to see you.
Your crazy ideas...
your new acts, the unusual.
Then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.
Keep rehearsing.
Just make it very clear
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve
and that they should
be nice to you anyway.
Ain't that a
sight for sore eyes?
He couldn't even say "hello."
Or "goodbye."
He's going on tour. Sorry, guys.
Oh, pull yourself
together, Carlyle.
Don't you have
somewhere to be?
Anne Wheeler.
Mr. Barnum said
he left a ticket for me.
I'm sorry.
I believe there's only
supposed to be one.
No, there's meant to be two.
I wasn't sure
you'd come if I asked.
Five minutes to curtain.
I've always wanted
to go to the theater.
Phillip, is that you?
Mother.
Father.
This is Anne Wheeler.
Phillip, have you no shame?
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...
but parading around
with the help?
Anne.
Anne!
Anne!
How dare you speak
to her like that?
You forget your place, Phillip.
My place?
Mother, if this is my place,
then I don't
want any part of it.
Anne.
They're small-minded people.
Why do you care what they think?
It's not just them.
You've never had
somebody look at you
the way your parents
looked at me.
The way everyone
would look at us.

First, it was buying a house on
the same street as my parents.
Then, meeting the Queen.
Then bringing Jenny Lind,
then my father the other night.
When will it ever
be enough for you?
I'm doing this
for Caroline and Helen.
Look around you.
They have everything.
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.
No, you don't understand.
How could you?
My father was treated like dirt.
I was treated like dirt,
and my children will not be.
You don't need everyone
to love you, Phin.
Just a few good people.
I know that.
Sir.
No, no! Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy, no! Wait!
- Daddy!
- Go!
Wait, Daddy!

Well, Mr. Barnum.
This...
is...
to making
dreams come true.
Thank you, Jenny.
It's two hours to curtain.
I've given you
the world, haven't I?
I, uh, I should go.
I've become a distraction.
I'm sorry, Jenny.
- No.
- You should finish the tour without me.
What? You're leaving?
Well, the itinerary's
well in hand.
So, that's it.
What do you mean?
I'm just another one
of your little acts.
- Jenny.
- I'm done.
Jenny. Jenny, please.
You have to finish the tour.
Must I?
It... it will ruin me.
When you're careless
with other people, Mr. Barnum...
you bring ruin upon yourself.
I have risked everything.
Well, so did I.
And it seems we both lost.

Thank you.
What was that?
That was goodbye.
<i>Hey, thank you
very much for coming.</i>
- Tell your friends and neighbors!
- What a wonderful show!
Who enjoyed themselves?
You? You?
Tell everyone how much fun
you had at the circus!
New acts every night!
Hey! Ringmaster.
Gentlemen,
gonna have to ask you to leave.
This is our town, son.
We think you should leave.
You and your freaks.
And your spooks.
Sir.
I will only ask once more.
Then what, boy?
Hey! Stop!
Get him!
Charge!
- Could that be her?
- I think so.
Daddy!
Daddy!
- Girls, girls, girls!
- Daddy!
Oh, you've grown so much.
Stop it.
What made you decide
to come back early?
I missed you. I missed you.
That sounds an awful lot like Humbug.
Fire!
- Move aside!
- Come on!
Hurry! It's coming
from the circus.
Run! Let's go! Fire!
Girls, stay with me. Come.
Quick, quick!
Everyone, stay close!
Phillip! Is everyone out?
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.
The animals? The animals?
Yeah, we set them free.
What else could we do?
W.D., where's Anne?
Where's Anne?
Where's Anne?
No, Phillip! No!
Hey! You can't go in there!
- Anne!
- Phillip!
Keep pumping!
W.D.!
Here she is! Here she is!
Phillip!
- Phillip!
- Daddy!
- No, Daddy!
- Daddy!
Daddy!
Stay back! Please!
Daddy!
Stretcher!
Stretcher!
He's taken a lot of smoke.
He's still breathing. Come on.
Come on, let's get him on!
Up!

Here we go, guys!
Come on! Straight ahead!
Thomas, help me break this up.
If you've come to gloat,
I wouldn't.
They caught the thugs
who started the fire.
I thought you'd like to know.
I never liked your show.
But I always thought
the people did.
They did. They do.
Mind you,
I wouldn't call it art.
Of course not.
But...
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...
all colors, shapes, sizes...
presenting them as equals...
Why, another critic
might have even called it
"a celebration of humanity."
I would've liked that.
Mmm.
- Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
- Hmm.
I mean, thank God
for Jenny's tour.
We can borrow off the profits,
we'll be fine.
You don't know?
Hmm?
I'm sorry.
Charity?
Oh, God, Charity.
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- I am...
Nothing happened.
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, sure. Nothing happened.
It's on the cover
of every paper in New York.
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!
Of course you're not.
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.
Just you and your show.
What are you doing?
I'm going home.
This is your home.
The bank...
they're evicting us.
Why didn't you ask me before...
I would've said yes.
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.
Figured you'd end up here.
Feeling sorry for yourself.
Folks, if you've
come to get paid,
the money is gone. All of it.
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.
You just don't get it.
Our own mothers
were ashamed of us.
Hid us our whole lives.
Then you pull us
out of the shadows.
And now you're
giving up on us, too.
Maybe you are a fraud.
Maybe it was just
about making a buck.
But you gave us a real family.
And the circus...
that was our home.
We want our home back.

Caroline! He's here.
I would like to see my wife.
She's not here.
She's at the beach!
I brought hardship
on you and our family.
You warned me...
and I wouldn't listen.
I just...
I wanted to be
more than I was.
I never wanted anything
but the man I fell in love with.

Bank said no?
Emphatically.
Repeatedly.
I don't think there's a banker
left in the country
I can fool into loaning me
more money, so...
I'm really sorry
to disappoint you all.
Don't worry, Barnum.
We've gotten used to it by now.
You know, Barnum...
when I first met you...
I had an inheritance, acclaim,
an invitation
to every party in town.
And now, thanks to you,
all that's gone.
All that's left is
friendship, love,
and work that I adore.
You brought joy into my life.
- Into all our lives.
- Hear, hear.
If only the bank
would take joy as collateral.
They may not...
but I will.
I own 10% of the show.
Knowing who I was working for...
I had the good sense
to take my cut weekly.
Phillip, I can't let you
gamble it on me.
Sure you can.
Don't turn
sensible on us now.
Partners.
50-50.
Partners.
Yeah!
The only thing is,
I don't know how
we're gonna afford a building.
Right.
Building.
We don't need a building.
Real estate in Manhattan
is a terrible investment.
Why, I can get land down by
the docks for almost nothing!
All we need is a tent.
