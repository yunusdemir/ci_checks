You do realize you're going
to have to take a bubble bath
after you eat that.
- Do you want to hold it now?
- Grandma...
Two more. There's one down there, too.
My mom was one of my best friends.
I talked to my mom every day.
One day, I called her,
and it just rang and rang and rang.
Nobody ever answered.
You come up with every
reason that she's fine.
She's just not here, but she's fine.
That's how you go to sleep at night.
We would talk regularly
about Lynda's whereabouts.
There were a lot of missing pieces.
I just wanted to find her, to help her.
You don't know where to turn next.
You don't know what to do,
and you feel this guilt.

Oh, Lynda was ecstatic
to be a grandmother.
She was thrilled.
She was the boss of being grandma.
♪ Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday ♪
My mom, she let my oldest son...
Kind of let him run the show.
She did whatever he wanted her to do.
If he wanted to play baseball,
she played baseball.
If he wanted to run around,
they ran around.
In the spring of 2000,
44-year-old Lynda Mcclelland
is a doting grandmother of two
with a third grandchild on the way.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
My mom was very, very excited
when she found out I was pregnant.
I was crying,
and she was so happy.
Ready to make a wish?
They didn't live very far from her.
She decided "That's who
I'm going to live for."
Are you ready?
So I could not believe
when my sister came up missing.
Three. Two.
One. Blow!
The day that my mom went missing,
it was like any other morning.
I got up,
made coffee, made the kids' breakfast.
We kind of got ready for the day.
It wasn't unusual for David to be gone
if I woke up in the morning.
24-year-old Amanda
Repasky is a stay-at-home mom
while her husband, David,
works as a cook
and occasionally repossesses cars.
The two met when they
were in high school.
It's hard to raise children.
It makes you appreciate
your parents more
and understand a little bit more.
Later that morning,
Amanda receives an unexpected visit
from her mother's
boyfriend, Nate Linson.
Nate, what's going on?
Have you talked to your mom?
Lynda and Nate have been
dating for 5 years,
and Amanda knows they had
an argument the night before.
I went to her house. I called. Nothing.
She was breaking up with
him, and because my mom wasn't home
when he went over there
first thing in the morning,
he was alarmed.
Something's not right.
I told him to leave her alone,
to give her some space.
It kind of upset me
that he went over there.
When Nate leaves,
Amanda tries calling her mom,
who lives alone less than a mile away.
Lynda works as a server
at a local restaurant,
but Amanda knows she's supposed
to have the day off.
It just rang and rang and rang.
Nobody ever answered.
My sister was very reachable.
We didn't have cellphones, but
I always knew where to find her.
If she was going to a friend's
or something, she told somebody.
Her house was two football
fields away from her job.
She shopped in the same parking lot.
You knew where she...
She wasn't going anywhere.
I went on my day.
I didn't become alarmed
until probably around 5:00 or 6:00
when I hadn't heard from my mom.
By the evening, Amanda
knew something was wrong,
like, "Why isn't my mom
answering or calling?"
Amanda was pregnant, so Lynda
would be calling every day.
"How do you feel? Do you need anything?
Are you out of crackers?"
I went to her house.
It was probably around 8:30.
I thought it was odd
because her door was locked.
Typically, if my mom wasn't there,
her door wouldn't be locked,
'cause she always left
her door open just in case,
I guess, I mean, someone needed
to get in or come over.
When I entered, her house
was out of place.
Her keys were there,
and her phone wasn't there,
but the wire was there.
It looked like it had
been cut, which was odd.
So, at that point, I was very concerned.
That night, I went to the police.
- How can I help you?
- Hi.
Um, I need to report a missing person.
I told them that we hadn't
heard from her all day.
At first, they told me
they couldn't do anything
because, for one, she was an adult,
and it hadn't been 48 hours yet.
Until I told them that
she had a mental illness,
and maybe something was wrong,
and she needed help. That's all I knew.
As Amanda provides
police with background on her mom,
memories of her childhood
come flooding back.
Oh, my mom loved me and my sister.
I mean, she was so happy to have us.
The first time I remember
something being different about my mom,
I was probably only 3.
She was hugging me,
which is very endearing.
However, she was hurting me.
She was holding me too tight.
I remember my dad trying to tell her
that, you know, everything was okay
and that she needed to let me go.
Maybe she thought that
somebody was about to hurt me.
At some point, she was
diagnosed with schizophrenia.
When Lynda was on medication,
she was normal.
I mean, she went to work.
She paid her bills.
She did everything
that she was supposed to,
but you knew if she
didn't take her medicine.
Everyone did.
When my mom was off
her medication, like,
she would kind of see things
that weren't there.
But according to her
family, the last several years
have been one of the most stable
periods in her life.
She made great friends.
She had a nice house,
and she was really happy.
She was normal, healthy,
as healthy as somebody with
her mental illness could be.
That night, Forest Hills police
put out a missing persons
bulletin for Lynda Mcclelland
and gather more information
from Amanda.
Last night her boyfriend, Nate, called.
He was concerned about her,
so he went over.
And when Amanda provides details
about the previous night,
police believe there may be
cause for concern.
That's the last time I've seen her.
Dave, the kids, and I
went out to a street fair,
and when I returned home,
I had a lot of missed calls from Nate.
So I called him back, and he was upset.
He said my mom wasn't okay,
and that she was throwing glass
and breaking glass around her house.
So a friend of mine watched my kids
while I went to go check on my mom.
Mom!
- Oh. Amanda.
- Hey, Mom.
- Mind if we come in?
- Sure.
When I got there, she was fine.
She had broken a glass
that was on a shelf.
He's over-blowing things
like he always does.
Why would you listen to Nate?
She was sound. She appeared fine.
There was no reason for me
to be concerned.
I am fine.
Trust me. I am fine.
Amanda knows her mom's
relationship with Nate
had run its course, and they
were no longer getting along.
I had known, earlier that
day, that they were fighting.
Both of them called me and talked to me.
I had told him just to leave her alone.
I don't know why
he overreacted like that.
I really don't.
Come on, honey. Let's go home.
Night, Mom.
They talked for a time,
and Amanda felt
that her mother was okay.
So she and her husband left,
and that ended up being the last
time that she saw her mother.
We were looking at every
possibility at that point.
Because of the urgency,
because of the history
of mental illness,
because of the possibility
that she had wandered off
and was confused, Forest Hills
police did alert the media
and let them know that Lynda Mcclelland
was missing.
The night before, when I did see
her, to me, she appeared fine.
However, I started
to second-guess myself...
He's over-blowing things
like he always does.
...and think, "What if I misjudged,
and she was off her medication?"
Night, Mom.
As news of Lynda's
disappearance spreads through town,
family members begin
to scour Forest Hills
and the surrounding area.
In between Lynda's house
and where Dave and Amanda lived
was, like, up a hill and a whole
lot of woods in between.
Lynda had walked to their home,
and it was a pretty good distance.
So we would walk through those woods.
And I know that Amanda hiked every inch
of those woods pregnant.
We put signs up everywhere.
Like, everybody was looking
for Lynda at that point.
My mom was loved
by everyone that met her.
She would give the shirt off
of her back to help anyone.
At this point, everyone was concerned.
I was a member of the
Allegheny County Police
Department Homicide Unit.
They called us in to assist
with the investigation.
So when was the last time
you spoke to your mother?
I guess it was 4 days ago now.
Anything could have been
possible at that point.
She could have committed suicide.
She could have been murdered.
She could have died accidentally,
or she could have just left the state
and started a new life.
Can you describe
what your mother was like?
My parents met in high school.
They were really in love.
They got married
right out of high school,
and then my dad joined the army,
and then my mom and him traveled around.
I was born in 1976.
My sister was born actually
not even 13 months later.
My sister, Lynda, wanted a family.
She wanted to be married and raise kids.
She wanted to be a mom.
According to Amanda,
Lynda was a loving mom.
But as the girls grow older,
the family begins to see signs
that things are off.
My mother was a very spiritual person.
When we lived in Germany,
she used to take us to churches,
and we would just sit there
for sometimes hours
and just look at the different statues
and graves.
Most of the time, she prayed
for me and my sister,
that we would be healthy and happy,
that we would find the person
that we're supposed to,
have healthy and happy kids.
I was 9 years old the first time
that my mom disappeared.
I remember, one time, coming home,
and it was me and my sister,
and our cat was about to have kittens.
We were really excited, so we came
and were looking all over
the place for the cat.
I remember opening the closet door
to see if the cat was in the closet,
and her stuff was missing,
and we realized that she was gone.
At that age, I don't think
we really understood
what it meant to be sick
or have a mental illness.
I mean, at 9, I wanted my mom.
I'm a girl, you know.
When you're a girl, you want
your mom at 9 years old.
It's like she snapped.
She started to disappear
for a couple weeks at a time here,
a couple weeks at a time there,
and not really give any location
where she was going
or why she was going.
Lynda's behavior puts
a strain on the marriage.
And when Amanda is 12
and living in Indiana,
her parents divorce.
Her father gains custody of the girls
while Lynda moves to Forest Hills
to be close to her parents.
He never said anything bad about her.
He used to always tell me
and my sister that she loved us,
that it wasn't her fault,
and that, if she could be there
with us, that she would be.
After she got divorced
and moved to Pennsylvania,
she was getting healthy again.
She took her medicine every day,
did everything that
you're supposed to do.
She got her home.
She had a job.
She was at the hospital
every day for my dad,
taking food to my mom.
She was taking care of the family.
More than anything, she wanted the girls
to be able to come to Pennsylvania
and live with her, more than anything.
Four years later, Amanda
moves to Forest Hills to join her mom.
I moved in with my mom at 16,
and we ended up being best friends.
I talked to her about everything.
Had she mentioned
that anything was wrong?
I wanted more than
anything for her to call.
I wanted her to call
and be upset with me
because I did have
everyone looking for her,
and I did call the cops.
She... she told me she was fine,
but I don't know.
Lynda had disappeared in the past,
but I know my sister.
This time, when she left,
this time, it was definitely different.
While the homicide team takes note
that Lynda had occasionally
gone missing in the past,
a search of her home
suggests possible foul play.
The house was in somewhat disarray.
There were items scattered about.
One thing of note was there was
some dried cleanser in the sink.
Amanda had told us that her mother
was typically a very clean person,
keeping a very neat home,
and that wouldn't be something
that Lynda would normally leave.
The other weird circumstance
was that her telephone base
and handset were missing from the home,
but the purse was left behind.
That's a red flag that
maybe something happened,
either foul play
or perhaps Lynda did,
in fact, take her own life.
But investigators find no
traces of blood anywhere in the house.
The crime lab actually used luminol,
and that was all negative.
Another day goes by,
and Lynda's family
continues to put up posters
and scrapes together money for a reward.
They also keep searching
the heavily wooded areas
that surround Pittsburgh.
You're in limbo.
You stop everything.
You don't sleep. You're not eating.
It was horrible.
David was worried about Amanda's state
because she was pregnant.
She lost weight. She was shaking.
She couldn't sleep.
Every time my phone rang, I thought,
"Oh, God. This is going to be it."
And then I would be disappointed
every time I answered the phone.
I just wanted to find her, to help her.
While Amanda holds out
hope that her mom is still alive,
police pay a visit to Lynda's
boyfriend, Nate Linson,
who offers a strange theory of his own.
- Nate Linson?
- That's right.
We're investigating
the disappearance of Lynda.
He told us that he thought
that Lynda may have taken
a walk in the woods.
It was kind of an odd statement
to just throw out there.
It was obviously something
that we had to follow up on.
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know where she is.
Nate would say, "I'm so
sorry, Lynda," to her picture.
He would apologize to me,
and I would ask him, like,
"What are you sorry for?"
When's the last time you seen her?
You might want to take
a walk in the woods
if you're trying to look for her.
Lynda Mcclelland's boyfriend told us
that he thought that Lynda may
have taken a walk in the woods.
He said that she had a dream
that somebody was in her backyard
in the woods behind her home
digging a hole.
That was kind of an odd thing to say.
Then he made some comments
about how he and Lynda
would take long rides together.
So we didn't know if maybe Lynda
went with her boyfriend,
and something happened.
I loved her to death,
but she had her own unique way.
Nate also tells investigators
that Lynda called him the night
before she disappeared,
leaving him several voicemail messages.
Mind if I check inside
the house, take a look around?
Look away, sir. I got nothing to hide.
He agrees to let detectives
search his home.
We did want to retrieve the messages
from his answering machine.
We also had to look into
every possibility,
that maybe something happened
to Lynda at his home.
I did kind of suspect
that something happened.
I thought maybe they went for a ride.
They got into a fight.
Maybe she got out of the car.
Amanda came to my home the
night my sister came up missing.
She thought that Nate had
a little something to do
with where Lynda was,
and he wasn't telling us.
And as more time passes,
Amanda finds Nate's behavior
increasingly suspicious.
He would say some very strange things.
Nate would say, "I'm so sorry,
Lynda," to her picture.
He would apologize to me,
and I would ask him, like,
"What are you sorry for?"
But he never really would answer.
I would say, like, "Did you go
for a ride with her,
or maybe were you fighting with her,
and she fell down the steps?"
I would try to get him
to tell me what happened.
But when investigators
search Nate's home,
only a mile and a half from Lynda's,
they come up empty-handed.
We'll be in touch with you.
There was no indication or no evidence
of any type of foul play
that occurred at his home.
There was no physical evidence
linking him to the crime,
and as it turns out, there was
really nothing of any value
in those messages that helped us
with the investigation.
At that point, we had no
reason to believe
that he had anything to do
with her disappearance.
His general demeanor, although odd,
it was very clear
that he cared deeply for Lynda.
Instead, Nate urges
police to consider the possibility
that Lynda took her own life,
a scenario that Amanda's
husband, David, also raises.
There was an initial report
that Lynda had made some statements
about harming herself, in particular,
that Lynda had threatened to
jump off the Westinghouse Bridge
about two weeks prior
to her disappearance.
This bridge, in particular,
is well-known in the area
for people to commit suicide
by jumping off of it.
It's a very high bridge.
It goes over a very,
very narrow body of water.
However, we did conduct
a very thorough search
of that entire area,
but we didn't find any
evidence of Lynda's remains.
And Amanda refuses to believe
that her mother would take her own life.
My mom had a saying,
when she would get frustrated,
"I'm going to jump off the bridge."
It never meant anything, though.
She was so excited
about the new baby coming.
She would never have left
the grandkids, never.
With no sign of Lynda anywhere,
detective opferman tries to
prepare Amanda and her family
for the worst-case scenario.
I recall telling her
that she had to be prepared
for the possibility that we may
never find her mother,
also the possibility
that we may find her deceased.
He didn't sugarcoat things.
He warned me ahead of time.
But when you do watch the news,
and you do see that they found a woman,
then immediately, you think, like,
"Oh. Is this going to be it?"
It's hard not knowing
where someone that you love is.
Just when the leads
are beginning to dry up,
a witness who'd seen
a story about Lynda
on the local news calls police
with some new information.
Finally someone was like, "I know her."
It's been a week
since Lynda Mcclelland
vanished without a trace
from her home
in Forest Hills, Pennsylvania,
and there has been
no apparent sign of her
until now.
This tip that we got
was that Lynda was seen
on a walking trail
in an adjacent county
to our jurisdiction.
That woman was very adamant
that the person was,
in fact, Lynda Mcclelland.
So Opferman had to go out to this trail
for three or four days.
We're searching for a missing person.
He would show the picture
of my mom to people.
You might have seen her around here.
Yeah. I saw her just yesterday.
And finally, someone
was like, "I know her."
There was a woman
who matched Lynda's description
who worked at a nearby restaurant.
They were similar in appearance,
but this woman was
somewhat younger than Lynda.
It was very clear that it wasn't Lynda.
I remember Opferman calling
me and saying, "Oh, my gosh.
She looked identical to your mom.
It's like her twin."
But it was not her.
Even though you feel, in your heart,
that the outcome is not
going to be the best,
I don't think you ever
really give up hope.
When you're driving,
and you see somebody
that looks like that person,
you have to stop.
You have to look at their face.
You have to turn around.
Everybody walked like her.
If you walked like her,
if you had a purse like her,
every single person, you think it's her.
When it was my oldest son's birthday,
and she didn't call
and tell him "Happy birthday,"
I think that was, in my head,
the first time
that I didn't expect her
to turn up after that.
- Do you want to hold it now?
- Grandma...
There was no way
that, if she was alive,
that she would let him have his day
without her telling him
"Happy birthday."
Kind of slippery.
Here, grab ahold of this.
No way.
The search for Lynda
continues for weeks
and then months, and still no leads.
Detective Opferman eventually
moves onto other cases,
but he promises Amanda he won't
stop looking for her mom.
We continued to check with hospitals.
We continued to monitor any records
about any remains that were recovered.
We had no real information
about where Lynda could be.
The case went cold pretty quickly.
However, I remained
in pretty regular contact with Amanda.
We would talk about different things,
sometimes her theories
about what may have happened
to her mother.
You just don't know where to turn next.
You don't know what to do,
and you feel this guilt.
A year goes by, and we were able
to get somebody
to put up more money for a reward.
Still nothing. We still
did not hear anything.
You really hope that maybe she's
living in a cult somewhere.
You come up with every
reason that she's fine.
She's just not here, but she's fine,
and that's how you go to sleep at night.
Around the anniversary
of Lynda's disappearance,
Amanda and her sister
contact a television talk show
and request a reading from the
program's well-known psychic.
The family hopes their appearance
will generate new leads.
I don't think that we
really thought she was going
to magically tell us where our mom is,
but it put her picture out
there so it wasn't forgotten.
I thought it was a good idea.
Any clue at all would be
awesome, 'cause we knew nothing.
The psychic said something like,
"M.J. came to the door,
and she left willingly."
She said that she was in
a psychiatric ward in Florida.
The psychic told Amanda
that her mother was alive,
and that she was most likely
near a body of water.
I was skeptical,
but I didn't discourage her.
I think she was at a point
where she needed
to try to find this out herself.
After the psychic
reading, we were thinking,
"There is hope. She's
out there somewhere,
and she's going to come home."
I called every psychiatric ward
that I could find, actually, in Florida,
but they can't really
give you any information.
They can't tell you anything.
So all's you can do is tell them
who you're looking for
and tell them something
that you want to say to them.
And then they post it on a board,
and then you just have to wait.
A lot of waiting.
- Say hi to Daddy.
- Hi, Jasmine!
There has to be a certain point
where you have children,
and you can't just stop your life.
Hey, Dad!
I think that's
the hardest part, though,
is 'cause you do feel this guilt.
You're kind of moving on,
even though you're really not moving on,
but you do kind of feel... Like you are.
On Easter morning, almost two years
after her mother went missing,
Amanda is at home with her children
when she gets a shocking phone call.
But it's not about her mom.
David went out to go
get Easter baskets,
and we were supposed to go
to his family's house.
So the kids and I were getting ready,
and, the next thing I knew,
his mom is calling me...
Hello?
...and said, "What is going on?"
What? S-slow down. What?
And I was like,
"What are you talking about?"
And she's like, "David's on
the news and just got arrested."
On March 30, 2002,
Amanda Repasky is stunned to learn
that her husband, David,
has just been arrested.
Hello?
Wait. Wait, what?
S-slow down. What?
David is charged with
criminal trespassing and burglary,
1 of 10 people arrested
in a major burglary ring.
These were 10 men
in their mid-to late-20s.
They would go down through roofs.
They would steal safes,
any money they could get,
to the tune of more than
half a million dollars.
It was just shocking
that that's what you chose to do,
is go and burglarize someone's house.
I was just so confused.
You walking me?
David tended to live two lives...
...the one family life during the day,
and then at night, he was out
with his friends
committing burglaries, robberies,
or spending the money from those crimes.
All right. Let's get some names.
David admits to the crimes,
and, over the next year,
he works as an informant
and gives up the names
of his entire burglary crew,
including his best friend, D.J. Wall.
David, I think, ultimately decided
he was not going to go
to prison for a robbery
and leave his wife and children...
D.J.
...even if it meant telling
on his lifelong friend
D.J. Wall and the others
to save his own skin.
D.J. and another member
of their crew, Doug Hubbard,
are arrested and charged with
multiple counts of burglary.
At the time that they were arrested,
I believe they all knew
that David had informed on them.
Doug Hubbard started to come unglued
and was implying
that David had done something serious
that we were unaware of.
D.J. was more stoic
and told Doug to shut up.
I could tell by D.J.'s reaction
that whatever he knew about David
was significant.
I don't know, at that point,
if we had thought
that this might be
about Lynda Mcclelland,
but in the days after, there
was speculation about this.
Hey, D.J. How you doing?
When we confronted him
with the possibility
that he had information
regarding Lynda Mcclelland's death...
You know what I think?
I don't think it's a coincidence.
...his initial reaction
was to, uh, break down in tears.
D.J. Wall told us
that he received a call
from Dave Repasky
in the early morning hours.
Dave needed his help.
When he entered the home,
he found the body of Lynda Mcclelland
on the living room floor.
D.J. Wall's account
was that Dave told him
that he had gone to Lynda's house,
that he had been drinking.
His words were,
"One thing led to another,"
and that he and Lynda Mcclelland
had sexual relations.
David told D.J. That he had
been having an affair
with Lynda Mcclelland.
He said Lynda then threatened Dave,
stating something along the lines of,
"Now she's going to leave you for good."
Apparently Lynda was
going to tell Amanda.
You're done.
According to D.J.,
Dave became upset about this
and punched Lynda.
Lynda then fell to the ground,
and then Dave choked Lynda
with his hands.
And when Dave saw that Lynda
was still alive and moving,
he then stepped on Lynda's neck,
eventually killing her.
According to D.J.,
Dave had called him
to help him dispose of the body.
He asked D.J. If he
would start digging a grave
for Lynda's body.
They settled on a property
that was adjacent to D.J. Wall's
grandmother's house.
When they unloaded her from the vehicle,
he told me that David
was standing in the grave,
that he held her
and said to her, "I'm sorry,"
before lowering her into the hole
and covering her up.
I can only speculate
that David miscalculated
and figured that D.J. would not
tell on him about the murder,
because then D.J. would be
incriminating himself
in a homicide.
D.J. Wall agrees to show
police where the body is buried.
Lynda's body was eventually
recovered in that wooded area.
The location of her body,
the cause and manner of her death
was corroborated by his story.
The day that I found out
that she wasn't missing anymore,
Detective Opferman called me, and...
...he said, "I'm going to find
your mom for you today,
and Dave killed her."
It still sends chills down me
every time I think about that day.
On March 17, 2003,
David Repasky is charged
with the murder of his
mother-in-law, Lynda Mcclelland.
The day that we saw it on the news
was possibly one of the worst
days of my entire life.
She never just walked off.
She had never been missing.
None of that was true.
I never suspected
that my husband killed my mom.
I never for a minute thought it was him.
He was my best friend
still at this point,
and he watched me
really go through a lot of pain
and miss my mom.
I just don't understand
how you can watch someone
that you supposedly care about
go through so much pain.
As for David's motive,
Lynda's loved ones believed
she had learned about
David's secret life of crime.
There is no way
that my sister would have had
sex with Mr. Repasky.
No way.
If anything, she was going
to call the police that night
because of what he was doing.
She was afraid
that what he did for a living
was going to harm them.
At David's trial
for first-degree murder,
he maintains his innocence
and never takes the stand.
His best friend, D.J. Wall,
is the lead witness for the prosecution.
When his best friend was on the stand,
and if you looked at David's face...
...it was like he knew
everything before he said it.
That was the day that I knew for
sure that Dave killed my mom,
by watching his reaction,
his lack of reaction.
In March of 2004, David
Repasky is found guilty of murder
and sentenced to life in prison.
When he said "Guilty," I was relieved.
Soon after David Repasky
was arrested on burglary charges,
Amanda and her children move to
Indiana to be closer to her dad.
It's taken years to put
their lives back together
and reconnect with the rest
of her mom's family.
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.
I think that Dave took a lot from us,
but he didn't ruin our lives.
Hi, Noah. Last time I saw you,
you were like this tall.
- I grew a little bit.
- You did grow a little bit.
Me and my kids are happy,
and I wanted that for them.
I didn't want this to be them.
I just want people to know,
really, how great Lynda was.
There's two more.
There's one down there, too.
She was a great sister, a better mother,
and a perfect grandma.
Whoo-whoo!
She did not deserve to die
because of Dave Repasky.
We miss her still.
