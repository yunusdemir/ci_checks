Hey, everybody.
I'm James Duthie.
Yes, he is, and I'm Chad Bailey,
the sexy roguish new face
of our parent company's effort
to rebrand Sports Desk
for a new generation.
Sports Desk - it's not delivery.
It's Sports Desk.
OK. Uh...
We go live
to Reading, Pennsylvania.
With the Big League
officially shut down
thanks to the lockout,
all eyes are on the EMHL tonight
as the Reading Wolfdogs get set
to take on the Halifax...
Highlanders, this season,
the big show made it to us.
This lockout means there's gonna
be a whole bunch of big dicks
swinging their way down
to our league.
Play's gonna get faster,
the hits are gonna get harder,
crowd's gonna get crowdier.
You fucking boys
are the Light Brigade
and you're gonna need someone
at the tip of the spear.
- You need a captain.
- Yeah.
He's bled blue and orange
for this team a long time.
That's right.
He's got that shit
that keeps him going
long after he has any reason to.
Let's open that up.
Dougie.
Time for you to put
this fucker on.
Come on!
It looks good on you!
Alright.
A C! Whoo!
Thank you guys so much.
I've never been
a captain before.
One time, I had a dream
that I was the captain
of a monkey ship.
There was all these monkeys
playing around,
laughing, having fun, singing,
wearing little
monkey sailor hats...
fighting over life jackets.
Pierce Brosnan was screaming.
I hope one day I can be
the captain of your dreams.
Best wishes, Doug Glatt.
OK, yeah. Alright, good.
Well, we, uh...
Doug, we didn't make you captain
for your speeches.
We made you captain because...
Because you leave it all
out there on the fucking ice.
Ah, this sport is
everything to you, right?
You make me proud
to own this team.
I want you all to watch Doug
out there tonight.
Watch him do
whatever the fuck it takes
to get us a W.
That said...
Come on!
Let's get after it, boys!
- Congrats, bud.
- Thank you, buddy.
<i>Joining us
for tonight's game,</i>
<i>our own Red McCauley.</i>
<i>Reading City Council</i>
<i>spent a bunch of money
on a new jumbotron,</i>
<i>and right now,
it's making everything red.</i>
Go, boys! Go! Let's go!
I love this fucking game.
<i>Halifax and Reading.</i>
<i>Here's LaFlamme dancing
with the puck.</i>
<i>LaFlamme spins. He shoots.</i>
<i>He hit the post!</i>
<i>Now it's LaFlamme again!
He's all over the ice.</i>
<i>Murphy steps into him.</i>
<i>Oh! Glatt absolutely levels
Michael Murphy.</i>
Sorry, Mikey.
<i>Glatt's escorted aside by
a couple of Reading Wolfdogs.</i>
<i>LaFlamme. Xavi was flattened.
That angers Glatt.</i>
<i>Glatt fires a left.
He fires a right.</i>
Sorry, Mikey!
<i>They're falling.
The Wolfdogs are down.</i>
- Sorry, Mikey?
- Shut the fuck up, Doug.
<i>And that is
what friends are for,</i>
<i>especially when your friends
are huge Jewish guys</i>
<i>named Doug Glatt.</i>
<i>LaFlamme takes the puck.
He moves up the left wing.</i>
<i>LaFlamme trying to go
to the outside</i>
<i>as the penalties expire.</i>
<i>Both sides at full strength.</i>
<i>LaFlamme in behind the goal,
takes it into the corner.</i>
<i>He circles, looks in front.</i>
<i>Awaiting there is Glatt,
but LaFlamme holds on.</i>
<i>Jams it. He scores!</i>
<i>LaFlamme makes it 1-0
for the Halifax Highlanders.</i>
- Alright.
<i>- Reunited and it feels so good.</i>
<i>It's a new dawn for
the Halifax Highlanders.</i>
- You're like Captain America!
- Captain America.
<i>New owner and GM
Hyrum Cain's plan</i>
<i>to win a championship
in his first season</i>
<i>starts off with a bang</i>
<i>as the Highlanders open
the scoring.</i>
Highlanders draw
first blood at the buzzer,
but the real story here is
the physical play.
Doug Glatt,
like a huge Jewish freight train,
doing what he does best.
His tilt with Ross Rhea
still number one
on the hockeyfights.com
All-Time Best List.
He's already proving to be
a difference maker
for Halifax GM and Highlanders
Hall-of-Famer Hyrum Cain.
The other story to follow
is Hyrum's son, Anders Cain,
who's coming off that
career-high season last year -
80 points.
Anders now finds himself
up against his own father's team
in the very first game
of the season.
Anders is the prototypical
modern-era tough guy,
able to drop the gloves
and put up the points as well.
Anders and Xavier LaFlamme
are perfect examples
of the kind of
top-quality talent
this lockout is already
providing the league.
What a great lockout.
No-one ever says that.
I just did, and I'm Chad Bailey.
Sports Desk.
It's sports at a desk,
you lunatics.
Look at this motherfucking desk.
I wanted to thank my big sis, Eva,
for organising
the fuck out of this.
If you're gonna get shittered,
might as well get shittered
at my place of work.
Place of work!
Place of work! Place of work!
<i>just add
some cheese in there.</i>
Oh, shit! There he is! Dougie!
<i>When it gets to
a certain length,</i>
<i>I just go to the barber</i>
<i>and he cuts it to the length
that I want him to cut it to.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Attaboy, Dougie!
<i>But just to summarise, that's a yes
on mandatory neck guards?</i>
<i>Yes. That's correct. Thank you.</i>
<i>OK, now,
while we have you here,</i>
<i>is there anyone back home
you'd like to give a shout-out to?</i>
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>
<i>I want to say hi
to my one teammate, Eva,</i>
<i>who couldn't be here tonight.</i>
<i>She's my teammate
that can't be here right now.</i>
<i>- My wife, Eva.</i>
- Doug with that big dick!
That's not appropriate.
<i>I'll do whatever my team
needs me to do.</i>
Yeah, you do!
Whatever you need.
My beer's back.
Oh, f...
Fuck's sake!
Jesus Christ. Goddamn it!
No-one wants to skate anymore,
is that it?
Do you want to sit here
and breathe hard?
Dougie, you're on.
I want you to rough up a few of
these Reading cunts right now.
The boys need some inspiration
and you can provide that.
Let's go. Come on! Come on!
Here it comes.
You wanna go?
Come on. Come on.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Yes.
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>
<i>Anders Cain with
the opening salvo.</i>
- Come on, come on.
<i>- Doug Glatt is rocked!</i>
<i>Cain just keeps pouncing.</i>
<i>'The Thug's in trouble, folks.</i>
<i>What has happened
to Doug Glatt,</i>
<i>the champion in so many eyes?</i>
- You fuck!
- You popped your whole arm out.
Fuck me.
Did I lose?
Our boy's moving on
to greener pastures,
but remember,
once a Highlander...
- Always a Highlander!
- Fuckin' A!
This one's for you,
Dougie.
♪ Oh, Dougie boy
♪ The pipes,
the pipes are calling... ♪
Jesus Christ,
he's drunk already.
Fuckin' right, man.
Potato fuckin' salad.
Ow!
You will never eat a meal
in peace.
Animals don't eat in peace.
Animals eat
pieces of dog shit.
I'm not a fuckin' animal, man.
I'm a real person!
- I got real fuckin' emotions!
- Fuck you.
Ow, you fuckin' Neanderthals!
I'm so fucking tired, Doug.
I'm not as fast as I used to be.
I'm not as tough
as I used to be.
Dougie!
This is all for you!
How about you?
How much recovery time?
The doctor said that I should
never play hockey again.
Tabarnak.
Yeah, that's exactly
what I said.
And we have a baby coming.
Eva's cousin,
he's got a job opportunity
at an insurance company.
- I mean...
- Sing Dougie boy!
I got beaten.
He beat me.
I have to make
responsible decisions.
I got you. I got you.
Stevesy, I think
I'm gonna piss myself.
Hey! There's my guy.
Stay there. I'll come to you.
- Ooh. Yeah.
- Just stand here?
Just, uh...
- I told you I'm coming to you.
- I'm Doug Glatt.
I said I was coming to you.
I can do this.
Prostate.
It's like a fuckin' melon.
There we go. See?
Flat, I'm fine. It's the stairs.
- I'm Doug Glatt.
- Yeah. Bob Forbes.
- Ow, my arm.
- Oh, yeah. Hell of an arm.
How excited are you right now,
huh?
Yes. Thank you so much.
- The windows here are great.
- Yeah.
I'll tell you what,
you deserve 'em,
'cause the sky is the limit
here at Cornwallis Insurance.
- Hmm.
- You seen the commercials?
- No.
- Oh, you should.
They're real good. It says...
"Go ahead and call us.
We're..."
You want me to call you?
No, I want you to
finish the song.
- "Cornwallis."
- Oh.
Yeah. There he is.
He's going up, this guy.
Get in there.
It used to be a jail.
Prisoners killed themselves.
Doug Glatt, storage room.
That's you.
How's that feel?
You know,
you mentioned you play hockey.
I used to watch a lot of hockey
till it got too exciting
for the old ticker.
I had a massive heart attack.
Yep, I am a sick man.
Anyway, I'm lying on
my death bed
and that's when I got bit by
the selling insurance bug.
Yeah, she laid eggs
right inside of me
and now you're here.
I'm allergic to eggs.
You're an idiot.
Nobody's allergic to eggs.
Oh, Christ, this guy.
Come on. Come on.
Come on! Come on!
Get outta there!
Quit! Quit that!
It's like he's showing off, huh?
Nice thick stream.
- Yeah.
- God.
They got a whole alley
to do that in
and then they choose
this window to piss on.
- God, it's like crack to them.
- It's crazy.
They also sell crack
at that window.
- Oh. OK.
- Yeah. But don't worry.
It's safe as long as
you get out by sundown.
That's when the hand jobs start.
What the...?
There's a lot of cars
in our driveway.
- Aah! Surprise!
- Thank fuck!
I was gonna be in town anyway,
so I thought to myself,
wouldn't this be the perfect
opportunity to organise
a little something
for the two of you?
Oh, I am so proud of you,
Dougie.
You found something secure
and steady.
You see? Everything has
a time and a place.
Thanks, Mom.
A new house, a baby.
I can't believe I'm gonna be
a grandmother.
If I'm being honest,
there was a while where I never
thought it was gonna happen,
what with Ira being the way
he is and all.
- Jesus, Mom.
- Wow.
If it makes you feel better,
I go all kinds of ways.
What kind of ways?
Well, if you get me
drunk enough,
I'll munch a box,
piss on an animal.
I got all kinds of tricks.
Feels like my ass blew up!
Hey! There he is!
Nah, nah, come on.
Give me the good stuff.
Give me the... No, no...
Oh!
Fuckin' mazel tov.
Mazel tov. In your ass.
Oh, excuse me!
- I didn't...
- Oh, fuck.
Sorry, I was just pretending
to butt-fuck my friend.
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.
I'm Patrick Hoolihan.
We've met, you idiot.
You wouldn't stop hitting on me
at Doug and Eva's wedding.
Then you fell asleep
and pissed yourself.
- Nice. Represent.
- Yeah.
- Pat, why do you have a boner?
- You JUST noticed that?
- Wait, what? I have a what?
- It's nasty. Come on.
- Clean it up.
- Yep, I know.
No! Stop!
I'm just trying to
get rid of it.
- Pat always gets boners.
- Aargh! Damn! Hi-yah!
So, how was your first day?
Work? Oh. It...
Oh, it was so fun.
Yeah, I mean,
there was so many documents
and phone calls
to make and receive
and you sit a lot.
Like, pretty much the whole day.
You know, so it's safe.
You know, it's really safe.
Plus, there's a Harvey's
close by, which is good.
Hey. I'm proud of you.
Of us.
We're doing this.
It's... it's a fuckin' lot and...
it's crazy,
but we're doing it together.
- A team.
- Yeah, we're a team.
Got each other's backs.
I know it's hard for you.
I mean, I know you miss it
and I miss it too.
I love watching you play,
but I love you
and the family
we're gonna have more.
Ah! Christ. Droppin' loads.
Droppin' fuckin' hot meatball loads
from my asshole.
Hey, Pat.
Just... I was just...
I'm having... I'm having
some stomach issues today.

I'll tell you what,

I'm all about

Look at this fuckin' thing,

Dope, right?

You're watching Sports Desk.
Sports Desk -
we're all pink on the inside.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Anyway,
Halifax's woeful losing streak
extends to 12 straight losses
to start the year.
They've been in a rut
since their disastrous
season-opening loss to Reading
which saw then-captain
Doug Glatt hospitalised
following what would be
a career-ending tilt
with Anders Cain.
Can the Highlanders find a way
to turn things around?
I bought this team
'cause I win.
I know.
This lockout should be
the best thing that ever happened,
but we're blowing it.
We are going after
the biggest names
on this side of the Atlantic,
players you can
build a team around,
starting with Anders.
- Wait. Your son?
- Yeah.
He's been a fuckin' beast
for Reading,
not to mention he almost
single-handedly eviscerated us.
Why are you taking so much joy?
He pretty much ended
Dougie's fucking hockey career.
I think Glatt's career
was ending all by itself.
Well, we're never gonna
know that now, are we?
No offence, Hyrum, OK,
but you and your son are not
exactly Walter and Wayne.
That shit is behind us.
You can believe he won't fuck this up.
He knows what's at stake.
We go all in for Anders,
you're gonna make him captain,
and I'm gonna...
I'm gonna keep his ass in line.
Hyrum, please. Captain?
Let's talk about this.
- Ronnie.
- Let's think about the A...
- Ronnie.
- ..before we get to the C.
Ronnie, you're gonna
coach my kid.
You're gonna build a team
around him.
You're gonna make him captain
or I'm gonna find
some other fuckin' guy who will.
- Fine.
- Good.
Fine. Better than
being on the dole.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Welcome. What do you think?
- I think it's...
I think it's all... you.
- As it should be, right?
- As it should be.
- Great room.
- Great room.
Can I get you a soda pop or...?
- Uh...
- Sunflower seeds?
- Uh... Uh, yeah. Seeds are good.
- Help yourself. Uh, sit down.
Sunflower seeds are for winners.
- Son...
- Sorry.
You're carrying the torch now.
- Yes, sir.
- You're the one.
- Over to you.
- Holding the torch.
Our name's on your back.
Our family.
Our family, and, actually,
um, Mom was asking if...
Our name is a currency
in this town.
Absolutely.
I don't want you to fuck this up.
Not this time.
This season's everything.
The world is watching.
Maybe not the world.
I mean, Canada, probably, but...
And, like, three or four states.
Stand up.
- I'm giving you the C.
- Yeah.
- You're gonna prove me right.
- Yes, sir.
- You're gonna win.
- Gonna win.
- Stay the fuck out of trouble.
- Therapy worked this time.
- I don't wanna hear about that.
- I won't talk about it.
- That's for your mom.
- Yes, sir.
- That's shit for your mom.
- Yes, sir.
Don't bring shit up like that.
<i>You don't know
nothing about good times.</i>
<i>Let me tell you
about fuckin' good times.</i>
<i>I remember that summer
like it was yesterday.</i>
<i>Good music, nice heat,
great friends,</i>
<i>and one night
me and my friends -</i>
<i>my great friends -
went for hamburgers downtown.</i>
<i>That summer,
we ruled the world.</i>
<i>We thought we was the kings.</i>
<i>Turns out we was the jokers.</i>
<i>Look what
the fucking cat dragged in!</i>
<i>Love this fuckin' guy.</i>
He has hair like a lion.
Bring it in!
Bring it in!
OK, boys,
we kind of fucked up
the start of this thing, eh?
So now, we got a few lads
who earn their wages
up at the big show
down here with us
wearing our jerseys.
- Jean Pierre Finch.
- Yo.
We got, uh, Pet...
Petr 'Petri Dish' Petrov.
A lot of Ps.
- What's he doing?
- He's handing out candy.
Candy?
It's a Slovak tradition, maybe?
Better be.
Oh, my God.
OK. And Anders Cain.
OK. Super-duper.
OK, now that Dougie's retired,
we need a new captain,
and I cannot think of
a better leadership tandem
than Xavier LaFlamme with the A,
Anders Cain as captain.
There you go. Alright.
Alright.
This ice is shit. Fix it.
Perhaps the new captain
would like to say a few words
to his team.
- You'll be alright, son.
- Right. Right.
Nothing else fucking matters
if we don't win.
If they brought me here to win,
my dad brought me here to win,
that's what
we're gonna fuckin' do.
Anybody here like
fuckin' sunflower seeds?
Well, this bar and sunflower seeds
are fuckin' winners.
- Hey, hey...
- Fuck, yeah!
- Great. That's good. Yeah.
- Fucking right, Dad.
- Right?
- Right.
I know many of you are veterans.
Many of you are old friends.
Many of you have never worn
another sweater.
I'm here to tell you
all of that gets you nothing.
Produce, you will be rewarded.
Don't, you'll be sent packing.
It's a buyers' market out there,
so for most of you,
that's your fucking career gone.
You fucked up
the first part of this season.
Find a way to be relevant!
Make yourself fucking relevant
- because from this point on...
- Fuck!
from where
I'm fucking standing...
Ah, fuck!
it's Darwin.
Come on, guys!
I'm paying my rent here!
Real hockey, guys!
Hey! You! Look alive, man!
Who the fuck is Darwin?
<i>Anders, new team, new city.</i>
<i>Any message to the fans?</i>
<i>They brought me here to win.</i>
<i>Care to confirm or deny</i>
<i>the rumours of your captaincy?</i>
<i>It's my team now.</i>
<i>Xavier LaFlamme
declined to comment.</i>
Argh!
Whoa.
- What's the bag for?
- These are just documents.
This is a huge bag
full of documents.
I'm going to
the insurance festival.
Huh?
Well, I gotta go, Eva.
It's real late. 'Bye.
What... the fuck?
Hello, sir.
Holy shit on Mary's tits.
The fuck are you doing here?
I came here to see you.
I got injured. My right arm.
Yeah, I saw that.
Hard lad, is Anders Cain.
So, what are you doing
with the hockey bag?
- I wanna be a Highlander again.
- Oh, Jesus, kid.
- Will you train me?
- Train you to what?
Teach me to fight with my left.
Teach me to skate better.
What the fuck do I know
about skating, Doug?
You see what I do in there.
We can train another time
if you're not able to right now.
There's a restaurant nearby
that sells hot dogs.
We could just eat those instead.
Hot dogs?
Yeah, it's like
a sausage sandwich.
I know what
a fuckin' hot dog is.
It looks like a penis.
Jesus Christ.
Alright.
20 minutes. We go in there,
get it out of your system.
- Then you go right home, eh?
- Thank you, sir.
Oh, goddamn it. Not again!
They better not have fuckin'...
Aw, shit!
I left my fuckin' bus pass
in there.
I need my fuckin' bus pass!
- What time is it?
- 11:37.
Wait.
11:38.
- Did you just get home?
- Yeah.
The insurance carnival was long.
Mm.
I was meeting all these people
who do insurance.
It's really safe.
It's a real thing.
It doesn't sound like
a real thing.
- Uh... It...
- Mmm. You smell like hot dogs.
Thank you.
That's it. Rotate.
Rotate. Alright, now give me

and I am so excited
about this restaurant.
Me and the baby are gonna eat
the shit out of some pad thai.
Oh, why are we taking
the long way? It's not...
Doug, do you want to go in
and say a quick hello?
Well, I'll be honest,
I already ate and I'm already drunk,
so the bar
seems to make sense.
For fuck's sake!
Man, it feels like
it was fuckin' yesterday
that I was working here,
bartender,
boyfriend who played hockey.
Yep.
Now I'm pregnant and married
to a guy who says we're a team,
but he's always gone
and feels he has to hide the fact
that he eats hot dogs.
What the fuck happened?
Are we these people now?
This is... this is who we are?
Oh, yeah, that's us.
You and me, baby.
- No, me and... me and Doug are...
- I gotta take a piss.
- OK.
- I still got my jacket on.
- Get me another beer.
- Yep.
So, Dougie,
how's that new job going?
Oh, it... it's so... fun.
Yeah, there's... there's all
these documents, you know?
I get to bring a thermos
to work,
which keeps my food
hot and cold.
Sometimes
I put hamburgers in there.
It's up to me.
The way we're playing,
we're all gonna need a new job soon.
I suppose I could go back to
Pentecostal summer camp
with my cousin's boyfriend.
I'm gonna have to move back
with Mum.
And don't get me wrong,
I love her to bits,
but that bedpan fills up
fuckin' fast.
I don't want to work at
my uncle's eel farm.
Mm-mm.
I don't know
how to do anything else.
Ah, you know,
it's just a slump, boys.
It shall pass.
Come on, get 'em in ya!
Mmm.
All the drinks in this country
taste like piss.
It taste like a Cossack
shit in my mouth.
Oh, that tastes
like burps.
- Welcome home, kid.
- Thanks.
Big night, eh?
Everybody watchin'.
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
What poor bastard they got you
matched up with tonight?
Didn't they tell you?
Format's been changed.
Changed to what?
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Bruised and Battered
competition</i>
<i>is proud to bring you
tonight's special event -</i>
<i>10 fighters,
one rink, one fight</i>
<i>in our first-ever
battle royale!</i>
- Fuck him up!
- Are you ready?
- Are you ready?
- Really bad idea.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.
Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez! Oh, jeez!
- Aarrgh!
- Jesus Christ on a bike.
Fuck you, Glatt.
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know.
I went to fuckin' Princeton.
You look like Super Mario.
Hey, Andrew.
My fuck, can he still bang.
Come on, big guy.
What are you,
like, fuckin' 15 years old?
Ross! Ross! Ross! Ross! Ross!
Let him go. Let me go.
Let me go. I'm the ref.
Let me go!
Fuck it.
You're one tough
motherfucker, Dougie!
- Hey, kid.
- Hi, sir.
You alright?
Yeah. I've been better.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Ah, fuck.
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Let's not reinvent
the wheel here, eh?
Doug! Doug!
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
Hey, wait. I got you, buddy.
Maybe we should leave.
I got you.
Well, that was
a fuckin' shitshow, eh?
Not exactly playing hockey,
is it?
Thanks, kid.
You had my back out there.
I owe you.
Maybe I should take you
to the doctor.
What for?
So he can tell me I got
post-concussion syndrome?
One more bad hit
and you're done?
It's not fuckin' soccer, Dougie.
I've been hearing that shit
for a decade now.
That doesn't sound very good.
You looked mean out there,
kiddo.
Young Anders
better watch his ass.
Lead these guys!
Lead these guys!
What would a leader do?
What would a fuckin' leader do?
Alright! Alright! Listen up!
Captain speaking! Captain time!
Off your fuckin' phone,
LaFlamme.
- Get off!
- Turn it off.
You turn the puck over in
the neutral zone one more time
and I'll teach you a fucking lesson
you'll never forget.
- Got it?
- What the fuck you just say?
And you KHL garbage bullshit,
Ukrainian fuck Hockey League
Chernobyl disaster fucks!
You turn that fuckin' puck over
one more time
and I'll fuckin' kill
both of you!
- And you!
- Yeah?
Fuck, I don't even know.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Hey!
Be nice.
What?
Be nice.
Whoo! Whoo! Fuck, yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!
Sports!
You miss fucking Doug Glatt?
You think he gives two fuckin' shits
about you guys?
I care! I fucking care!
We're gonna do this together!
Highlanders on three!
One, two, three! Highlanders!
My line starts!
See? He gets it!
He fuckin' gets it!
He smiles, he fuckin' gets it.
Fuck! No!
No more fucking candy!
What the fuck?!
Holy shit!
<i>- Highlanders lead Newark...</i>
- Come on!
<i>1-0, thanks to a goal
by Anders Cain.</i>
<i>Anders Cain wants it badly.
Shoves his own teammate aside.</i>
<i>Now the captain awaits.</i>
<i>Cain takes a good look
up the ice.</i>
<i>- Down the other end...</i>
- Oh, no, he's not...
<i>is LaFlamme hovering
in the neutral zone.</i>
<i>Cain now works it up.
LaFlamme well ahead.</i>
No!
<i>A suicide pass!
LaFlamme is decked by Balacco.</i>
- Fuck!
- Fuckin' cunt.
<i>Down on the ice is LaFlamme.
He's spitting blood.</i>
<i>Here's Cain and Stevenson
going at the goal.</i>
<i>Anders Cain...</i>
What are you doing?!
<i>levels both the Newark goalie
and Stevenson.</i>
Fuck me.
<i>Now Cain draws a crowd.</i>
<i>Cain decks one, decks two,</i>
<i>and Cain stood up to the world.</i>
Your kid finally got suspended,
OK?
- He's destroying this team.
- What's that?
- You heard me, you little shit.
- Tread lightly, Ron.
Hyrum, did you not see
the same fuckin' hockey game
that I saw last night?
- Did you see that game?
- Yeah. I did. I saw compete.
It was misdirected,
but I saw compete.
The dressing room's
in the shitter.
It's tighter than a nun's cunt in there.
There's no chatter.
The boys feel like they're on
the chopping block.
They need someone
to pull them together,
and time after time after time,
he's proven he's not
the fuckin' guy.
Oh, what, so it's my fault
the fucking amateur hour...
Anders.
What about Doug?
- Doug. Doug?
- Maybe I was wrong about him.
I saw him at the shitshow
the other night.
- He looked mean.
- What, really?
- Yeah.
- We thought he was done.
Yeah, 'cause I fuckin'
made him done.
Alright, alright,
well, then maybe we bring him
back to practice, eh?
- Give him a shot.
- See if he's got what it takes.
But we saw what he did to him,
so what's that dressing room
gonna look like
with him and Glatt in it?
- I think we should find out.
- Fuck me!
Fuck you then,
'cause we're doing it.
♪ Baby, it's nice
to have you here right now
♪ Baby, it's nice
to feel you near... ♪
Oh, my lordy! It's Doug!
Jesus, Stevie,
you fell in the garbage!
- I'm OK.
- Welcome back, Dougie!
- Welcome home, Dougie!
- Welcome home, Doug.
Thanks, bud.
- Now we're talking!
- Fuckin' right.
OK, boys...
this is a big day.
First off, we're gonna
welcome back Dougie.
We're gonna see if he's
fit enough to play, alright?
Thank you, guys.
I'm so happy to be back here
and have a chance to...
be back here?
That's good.
OK, I'm so fuckin' excited
to tell you this.
Favourite part of
the practice for me.
- Puke time. Suicides.
- Let's give her!
- Lace 'em up! Lace 'em up!
- Man of iron.
- Jew of iron.
- Sorry I smell like garbage.
- See you out there.
- So glad to see you, man.
I totally thought
you were transitioning.
You're not home.
Your fuckin' jersey, you idiot.
You're not home.
You shouldn't have come back,
Doug.
You shouldn't have come back.
They gave you my C.
I think you gave me your C, bud.
Captain doesn't cheap shot,
doesn't try to end careers.
You think
you're a hockey player.
That's fuckin' funny.
See, Doug, I just do whatever
my team needs me to do.
See you out there, bud.
You look good.
Your face looks better.
OK, lads, some of youse
have a little rust.
We're gonna work some of that
rust off right fuckin' now, OK?
We're gonna play
some shutdown hockey.
Let's keep it clean, fellas.
You're all on
the same team here.
OK?
- Jesus fuckin' Christ.
- Don't mind me.
We won't. Let's go!
Move your feet, boy!
Move your feet!
Move it!
Keep your head up!
Keep your head up!
- Oh!
- Goddamn it! Fucking shit...
- Come on!
- Eh?
Nice, Dougie.
- Good job!
- Come on! Help me out!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
- The old boys are lookin' good.
Fuck!
- Nice, Dougie!
- Whoo!
- Fuck!
- Next goal wins.
Fuck 'next goal wins'.
What is this, street hockey?
- Car!
- Let's get 'em, Anders! Hustle!
Let's go! Let's go!
Anders, work!
- They're making you look bad!
- Game on!
Mum's got hot chocolate
at our place after.
Loser brings an orange ball
from Canadian Tire!
'Next goal wins' is a thing.
That's... that's not just
road hockey.
That's... that's...
That is a thing.
Whoo!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Come on.
You gonna fucking turtle on me?
- Hey!
- Come on, Dougie. Round two.
Puck's at your feet!
Play to the whistle!
- Come on, Dougie. Come on.
- Dougie, here!
- Move the puck!
- What the fuck?
Yes!
There you go!
Next goal wins it, right?
- Fuck!
- Jesus Christ, man.
Hey, Hyrum, what kind of
marshmallows do you like?
- Go fuck yourself.
- Boys, bring it in.
Better. Good hustle, eh?
Good hustle. Heart.
That's what it takes to win.
You guys are getting
first shift tonight.
Belchy, you nut, don't wander.
- You're startin'.
- Fuckin' right, coach.
- It's Canadian fuckin' hockey.
- OK.
Dougie, welcome back, son.
Welcome back.
- Come on.
- Good stuff, boys!
Doug, where were you?
- They called our names to go in.
- I'm sorry, Eva.
I'll explain
when I'm less sweaty.
Hey, Triceratops!
That's my favourite dinosaur.
Remember how I keep saying
that work is fun
and there's all these documents?
Well, that's, like,
only half true,
because it's not fun at all.
I just don't think
that the insurance bug
has truly laid its eggs
inside of me.
OK.
So, I mean, who said
you had to sell insurance?
I never told you that.
And I only got you
those bloody business cards
because I was trying to be cute
or some shit.
The Highlanders still need me.
But we're supposed to be
doing this together, like a team.
Neither of us are just making
decisions for ourselves anymore.
A lot of shit
affects both of us.
Look at her.
Look at what we did.
Yeah.
She looks like a beautiful
tiny mushroom person.
She's so cool.
Just...
It was different watching you
beat the piss out of guys
before I actually knew you.
I mean,
I fuckin' loved it, obviously.
Part of what made me dig you
in the first place.
But the fucking very moment
I fell in love with you,
it got scary.
Now you're my husband
and we've got...
- This is big shit, Doug.
- I know it is.
I love you,
and if you want to do something,
then I'm with you...
but I can't be scared shitless
every time you go out there.
So, what I mean is,
if you want to be
a Highlander again,
then go and be
a Highlander again.
I'll support you,
but you have to do
one thing for me.
I would do anything for you,
Eva.
Don't fight.
What?
I've seen you make hits
and kill penalties
and block shots with your face.
I'm trying, but you gotta
meet me halfway and...
and not fight.
You're more than that.
- OK.
- Thank you, Doug.
Thank you, Eva.
Come on,
you can't quit on me now.
What about all our adventures?
Remember that one time
I thought you had a watch?
God, you're just gonna
throw that away?
I'm sorry, Bob Forbes.
I don't know anything
about documents.
What, do you think I do?
God, somebody gives me
a document
and I go, "Mmm, err,"
give it to another guy.
That's how insurance works!
Goddamn it!
Well, can't say
I'm not sad to see you go,
but if you change your mind,
just know you always got a spot
here in the storage shed,
Dennis.
He's... he's staying?
No, he's going. Shit.
Argh!
Always driving away
the ones you love.
Yeah, that ought to hold.
Jesus Christ.
- Hey. How's your arm?
- Good, thank you.
How's your arm?
Listen, um, everybody's rusty
their first game.
It's OK, OK?
What the fuck? Belchy.
Belchy!
We are very much happy
you are playing again.
This is our gift to you.
Sandwich.
This is you upon receipt
of sandwich.
- Smiley?
- Mm-hmm.
Happy cartoon, huh?
Fuckin' A, man.
That feels fuckin' right.
We needed this, man.
You two fuckin' buffoons
are standing there
with your giant dicks.
I mean,
that's a fuckin' sturgeon, man.
Jesus Christ!
I always think you're gonna
fuckin' prank me or whatever,
or you're gonna say your shit
about my fuckin' mom, which...
No, no, no, no, no.
We respect your mother now.
She's becoming
very open-minded.
Yeah, man. Alright.
She's been working on that.
Big cream pie,
pearl fucking necklace...
Golden showers,
double penetration.
- Uh-huh!
- Double penetration.
No butt, just vagina.
- Two penis, one hole.
- Yes.
Warm, worm kisses
deep inside your mother.
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
The fuck is that?
Warm worm? Fuck you two, man!
You understand,
we are brothers.
We power-fuck your mother.
You know, I'm an idiot
for fucking even trusting you
for a second,
you Ruskie fuckin' pricks!
The best revenge is living well.
I'm not stooping to
your fuckin' level.
- The mayonnaise is semen.
- What?
- Semen.
- You know, ejaculate.
Doug Glatt
is a Highlander once more.
With just a quarter
of the season left,
Hyrum Cain seems to be trying
a hail Mary move
by bringing back a man
known for his fists
and, frankly, not much else.
No.
Considering this will be
Glatt's first hockey game
since being knocked out
by his now teammate,
the currently suspended
Anders Cain,
this should make for
an interesting locker room dynamic
and even more awkward
Cain family Boxing Day.
I mean, that household
is a fucking disaster.
- Just read the prompter, man.
- No.
I say what I want, James,
because I got a pair of balls,
not two pieces of pussy.
How long is this
gonna happen for?
For as long as it takes.
Sports Desk -
we'll take as long as it takes.
Sports Desk - fuck, yeah.
- Alright. OK.
- Ha!
- Fuck it.
- Off the belly. In the ear!
- Alright, no.
<i>- Doug 'The Thug' Glatt.</i>
Doug with that big dick.
- Too much?
- It's not...

'The Thug' can do his part</i>
<i>to get them back to
the play-offs.</i>
<i>So, the St John's Shamrocks.</i>
<i>The Shamrocks breaking out of
their own zone.</i>
<i>Here's the pass up the wing.</i>
<i>Oh, baby!</i>
<i>Doug Glatt's return</i>
<i>continues to electrify
his crowd and his team.</i>
<i>St John's still with
a man advantage.</i>
<i>LaFlamme getting up,
getting ready to go,</i>
<i>Anders Cain, no help tonight
as he has been suspended.</i>
<i>Five seconds to go on
the St John's power play,</i>
<i>and somehow Halifax
has been able</i>
<i>to keep this game
tied at zero.</i>
<i>Now LaFlamme
steps out on the ice.</i>
<i>Halifax with the heat on.</i>
<i>Carlson looking back,</i>
<i>takes the puck at
the blue line.</i>
<i>Now Carlson, he's got a cannon!
He winds it up.</i>
<i>Oh, everyone,

<i>Xavier LaFlamme
blocking a shot?</i>
<i>Now we go to Stevenson.</i>
<i>Stevenson moves down
deep into the corner.</i>
Oh, growing out a moustache,
you little bitch, huh? Huh?
I'm so exhausted! Gatorade!
<i>And now Glatt decides,
"Well, I'm a little thirsty."</i>
Sorry. Pardon.
I'm super thirsty.
<i>Meanwhile, Stevenson
comes out of the corner.</i>
<i>He scores!</i>
- He took my fuckin' bottle...
- Yeah!
<i>Well, I suppose there's no rule</i>
<i>about drinking
the opposing team's Gatorade,</i>
<i>but perhaps after tonight,
there should be.</i>
You stole
his Gatorade, man!
He's so mad!
<i>Highlanders win thanks to
the unquenchable thirst</i>
<i>of a man they call 'The Thug'.</i>
Good for you, kid.
Good for you.
Boys,
got a little heat going now,
right?
So we're all gonna
take that heat into Reading
and we're gonna burn
their fuckin' flesh off
like fuckin' flamethrowers!
- Sir?
- Yes?
OK, for the last time,
I'm gonna have to ask you to
lower your voice, OK? Just...
Sweetie, take that for me,
would you?
Uh, no, not in first class,
so I don't take your... anything.
- Alrighty. Sit down?
- Just have a seat there.
Yes, sir.
That would be wonderful.
Thank you very much.
And if you could just remain seated.
Oh for fuck's sake!
Hey, Belchy!
Come see! This toilet looks
just like your mother.
Only markedly less
toilet-like.
Oh, my God, you guys are...
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Disgusting.
Hey. I'm not done.

<i>Oh, Waxman's...</i>
<i>Cain scores!

<i>Great goal by Anders Cain

everything at us now

LaFlamme, do what you did
last game.
Stevesy, take his lead.
Yeah, yeah.
Dougie, listen to me.
You watch their backs,
keep your head in the fuckin' game.
Handle big man. You see him?
Send him a message.
Wake him up, Doug. Go, go, go.
Don't go starting shit
you can't finish.
<i>Coach Ronnie Hortense
had a few words for Doug Glatt</i>
<i>who hasn't fought since
he came back two weeks ago,</i>
<i>and he goes
straight toward Totan.</i>
- You are bumping me.
<i>- Mount Totan.</i>
You're so enormous.
Oy vey!
<i>Off the faceoff, the puck goes
back into the Wolfdog zone.</i>
<i>Now it's sent off to centre ice,
turned over by LaFlamme.</i>
<i>LaFlamme looks across,
finds Stevenson.</i>
<i>Stevenson dumps it deep into
the Wolfdog territory.</i>
<i>The puck goes around now

Here we go!

<i>Oh, and he misses completely!</i>
Fuck. Shit.
<i>It looks like he's in pain
on his right side.</i>
<i>Starting the other way,
the Reading Wolfdogs</i>
<i>with an opportunity for
the go-ahead goal.</i>
<i>The puck is brought in
across the blue line.</i>
<i>- He scores!</i>
- Fuck!
<i>- Reading win!</i>
- Fuck!
<i>And with just 10 games left
in the season,</i>
<i>the Highlanders
seem to have found a way</i>
<i>to rescue defeat
from the jaws of victory.</i>
Way to go, Dougie!
Come on, Doug.
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's go. Let's fuckin' go.
Beth! Beth, get in the car.
You better not have drank milk today,
you fuckin' lactose...
Come on!
- Did you watch the game?
- Yeah.
You said it could be scary
watching me out there.
Was it scary?
I mean, I don't like
watching you get hurt,
so, yeah, a little.
- Ah!
- Oh, God! Jesus!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
M-Maybe you shouldn't watch

Yeah. Alright.

<i>one can't help but wonder</i>
<i>if GM Hyrum Cain has
any more tricks up his sleeve.</i>
You broke your promise.
I'm scared.
I never felt that before.
He's wearing my C.
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's the best you can do?
I gave up stuff
I like doing too.
It's different.
You've never had a team.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe... maybe I never did.
I can still do what I'm supposed
to do. I can still fight.
I guess
that's the fucking problem.
Eva...
And yet the worst part is
you're making me into this
fuckin' naggy housewife.
Do you think I wanna be
fucking worrying about you?
You think I want to be
giving you shit?
I don't. This isn't who I am.
Eva, please.
Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere.
I eat this soup.
Yes, I know. That's why I...
I just need some time, Doug.
Dad,
I'm fuckin' sorry, OK?
I'm sorry.
I fuck... I-I fucked up.
Fuck.
I wanna win. I wanna...
Your contract's
been terminated.
Uh... I'm sorry. What?
You're on a flight
at 10:00pm tonight.
No?
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out of my face.
- You wanna swing at me?
- You wanna swing at me?
You're a fucking pussy.
I-I'm just saying,
you're pissed at Doug
because he's a hockey player
and he wants to play hockey.
He was fucking bare-knuckle
prize-fighting too. Jesus!
Whose side are you on?
We both agreed to do this
and we both gave shit up.
That's what growing up is.
I-I had shit
that I liked doing too.
Jägerbombs?
Look, I know
you sacrificed things.
I mean, you have a fucking baby
growing in your belly. I get it.
I just... I think that Doug's team
is more than just hockey,
you know?
More than a team, even.
Highlanders GM Hyrum Cain
confirming that Anders Cain
has been released
from his contract.
Let this be a lesson
to everyone out there.
Your father
will break your heart,
and then he'll shove it down
your fuckin' throat,
pull it out your ass,
put it right back in your chest.
No word on whether
Hyrum Cain plans to replace Anders
as the Highlanders round out
their season with must-win games
at home against the Lovell Kings
and Anders' old team,
the Reading Wolfdogs.
Stevesy, Legs, Geno,
you know what you need to do.
Eat up minutes.
Grind the shit out of them.
Make them fuck up.
Tonight, we need to play
fucking hard.
- Right, boys?
- Yeah.
- Alright, boys?!
- Yeah!
Let's fucking do this.
So, you pussies
playing hockey or what?
Wow.
I messed up, Pat.
You know, I really like
living with you in the motel,
but I just kind of
wanna go home now.
- Yeah, no, I-I get that.
- It's, uh...
It's definitely not the Ritz,
but so long as Sherilynn owns it,
it's a bed and it's free,
thanks to that deal
I cut with her.
What kind of deal?
Fucking the shit out of her
constantly.
Your cousin Sherilynn?
I don't think I'm the only dude
she's fuckin',
but then she's not the only dude
I'm fuckin'.
Eva? Hello?
Uh, hey.
Doug, um...
Eva, hello! It's me, Doug Glatt.
Uh, Doug, where are you?
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
I shouldn't have done that,
because we're a team.
I'm so in love with you.
We're gonna have a family,
and I swear...
Uh, Doug, my water broke.
It's OK. I can just buy you
another one at the gas station.
No, no! My water broke!
The baby, uh...
The baby's coming.
What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? Now?
Wait. What? What?
Mary's at the store... at the store,
so I'm all alone.
No, you're not. Like the baby,
I'm also coming now.
OK. OK.
Holy fucking cunt balls!
- It's happening!
- Keep your eyes on the road.
Oh, yeah. So sorry.
So sorry. So sorry.
But, Eva,
I just gotta tell you,
you, my dear,
are gonna look fucking radiant
during childbirth.
I am so sorry.
From now on, whatever we do,
we do as a team, OK?
You know,
there's just this natural beauty
that comes from
such a violent act -
the blood and the fucking pussy
ripping open.
Yeah, I'm gonna be
the best husband
and the best father I can be.
I'll just say it -
to me, no woman,
no fuckin' woman
is more beautiful
than when she's giving birth.
Could we, uh...
Guys, that's great.
Could we have no talking
for a bit?
Yeah. Of course.
Whatever you need.
Hey! Goddamn it!
What the fuck? What, is
everyone in this city Chinese?
<i>Oh, no!
Down goes Stevenson!</i>
Jesus Christ!
Come on! This is not how
we kill a fucking penalty!
Come on, Stevesy!
You're good, you're good.
LaFlamme, come on. Come on.
Good, get out.
- Watch the point!
- Sit down.
Rest that fuckin' ass.
Where the fuck is he?
Hortense keeps looking over
toward the dressing room.
Breathe, Eva, breathe.
- OK?
- OK.
Deep, slow breaths.
Breathe, Eva. Breathe.
<i>Lovell and Halifax,</i>
<i>now LaFlamme goes after
the puck in the corner.</i>
<i>He takes it in behind the...
Here it comes!</i>
<i>Oh! It's...
Oh! And down goes LaFlamme.</i>
<i>Now Owens is bumped by...
Ross Rhea?</i>
- Nice hit, eh?
- Better late than never.
Ross Rhea is back!
One last big push.
Can you do that for me, Eva?
<i>He's back as a Highlander!</i>
You know, son,
generally, it's polite to ask.
Go watch some curling and get
a fucking dye job, you old man.
Fuck you.
- Come on, Eva.
- That's it. OK, Eva.
Home stretch.
<i>Ross Rhea fires
that patented right...</i>
<i>- We thought he was done!</i>
- Old man, eh?
<i>And he's back in style.</i>
♪ I can't sleep tonight
I can't sleep tonight. ♪
Pat...
Hey, hey, hey!
Yeah!
Nice shot, man.
Let me know if
you're not gonna keep it, OK?
- Yeah, we're gonna keep it.
- Let me know.
Fuckin' weirdo.
Everyone OK in there?
Everybody's great.
Welcome to the Highlanders.
Looks like I'm not done
after all, eh?
Mazel tov, kiddo.
Hey!
A dick explodes, a baby is made
and a father is born.
I love you.
All these kisses.
- I will love your baby.
- Thank you so much.
That's so nice.
I'm a great babysitter, so I...
Not that you...
Oh, OK.
You have my back.
You have since we met,
and you need to know
I'll always have yours.
Something for the baby.
It's official. It's official.
- Go, Dougie.
- You go, Dougie.
I love you, buddy.
- Way to go, Dougie!
- Good boy!
Doug.
Thank you.
I don't know
who he is.
I love you, Eva.
Mm. I love you too, Doug.
Mm.
Damn!
I'm high as fuckin' balls.
Just big ol' balls.
PS, fuckin' pushing a baby
out your vagina blows hard.
I know.
But you were here.
I needed you and you were here.
It's the same shit, Doug.
It's the same shit
that brought you here
is the shit that needs you
to be out there.
They need you too.
Highlanders need you.
Doug, you need to be out there.
This is it.
The last game of the season.
The Highlanders
need one more win
after their gutsy
2-1 victory over Lovell.
And now, tonight,
their entire season
hangs on this one last game,
which should be a doozy
as it marks Cain's return
to the Halifax MetroCentre
in his first game back since
re-signing with the Wolfdogs.
Any message
for your former teammates?
Watch your back.
- Cain's gonna be out there.
- Fuck Cain.
The shape your shoulder's in,
you tweak it,
you throw one heavy punch
with that right,
that's your career fucked
for good.
I need to protect my team.
We're having
a very busy night here.
Xavier, you've been whatever
this team has needed you to be.
You've worked, you've bled.
I, uh...
I unstitched it
from Cain's jersey.
It's yours now.
You've earned it.
Flammer, Flammer,
come on.
I learned the difference
between a moment and a career
is evolution.
Evolution.
You will slow down.
You will get old.
Your body will fail you.
So you evolve.
You change your game.
You do what you need to do
with the time you got.
If not, you go extinct.
Evolve or go extinct.
- Are you ready to go extinct?
- No, I am not.
- No fuckin' way.
- Are you fucking extinct?
- No!
- No, absolutely not.
Well, I'm still here.
I'm not ready to go
fucking extinct.
- The Highlanders are still here!
- Yeah, we are.
The fucking Highlanders
are here!
Highlanders!
Highlanders!
Highlanders! Highlanders!
Highlanders! Highlanders!
Highlanders! Highlanders!
Highlanders!
Alright, boys?
Let's do this! Come on!
<i>This is it, folks.</i>
<i>It's do or die
for the Highlanders tonight.</i>
<i>Their entire season
comes down to this one game.</i>
<i>It's that simple.</i>
- Fuck 'em up!
- Come on!
Which one do you want?
I got the big one.
Ah, fuck it.
I want both of 'em.
It's open season on all your
fucking boys tonight, Doug.
- I don't have to fight you.
- Yeah, you do.
<i>So it's a must-win
for the Halifax Highlanders.</i>
<i>There's no tomorrow
if they don't.</i>
Guys, listen,
I got some changes here.
Flammer, Dougie, Rhea,
off the hop,
Legs and Geno on the back end.
OK, boys, let's go.
Game faces, focus.
They're gonna try and taunt us.
Don't look for shit.
<i>Now Doug Glatt comes out
to take the opening faceoff</i>
<i>alongside Ross Rhea,
former combatants.</i>
Hey, big fella.
You like Kim Mitchell?
That's what I thought.
Alright. We're fuckin' going.
- Alright, here we go.
- What the fuck did I just say?
Coach said don't look for shit.
That's shit.
I bet you don't like Rush either,
you fuckin' big Litvak.
He's looking for shit.
Goddamn it, laid 'em right out.
Jesus Christ,
what are they feeding ya?
A lot of fuckin' pierogis, eh?
Easy, big fella.
Alright. Here we go.
<i>Well, folks,
big girls may not cry...</i>
How about that, eh?
<i>but big men from Eastern Europe
apparently bleed a lot.</i>
Fuckin' right!
I can do this all night, boys.
You're gonna leave this building
in an ambulance.
Sorry, Point Break.
You say something?
- Rosser, Rosser, nah, nah.
- Come on, boy.
- You can come play.
- It's over. Go to the box.
No? Alright. You sure?
Oh! No.
He doesn't wanna fucking play.
Let's go.
<i>So at the faceoff,
the puck is dropped.</i>
<i>It goes back to Anders Cain.</i>
<i>The former captain
of the Halifax Highlanders</i>
<i>bounces off a check,
moves up the right wing</i>
<i>moves right in on goal,
trying to bang it by Belchior.</i>
<i>Runs into Ahmed.
They count the goal. Should it count?</i>
- Where's the fucking whistle?!
- Where the fuck's the whistle?
Cheap fucking goal.
<i>So, the Highlanders down 1-0
in the second period,</i>
<i>a game they have to win.</i>
<i>And here comes LaFlamme,
dancing up the centre ice.</i>
<i>LaFlamme makes a move,</i>
<i>dipsy-doodle, heads toward
the front of the net.</i>
<i>Flips it back.
Yakovlena. He scores!</i>
Yes!
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
<i>- Evgeni Yakovlena...</i>
<i>scored by number 6,
Evgeni Yakovlena.</i>
<i>So it's 1-1
in the second period.</i>
<i>Here once again is LaFlamme...</i>
<i>Oh! Was he hammered!</i>
- Horseshit!
- Fucking bullshit!
- Put me in right fucking now.
- You've done enough for tonight.
- Fucking asshole.
- We'll get him.
- That's fucking bullshit.
- He's a fucking lunatic!
<i>Now the puck finds its way
to Glatt.</i>
<i>- They're normally strangers.</i>
- Dougie!
<i>Holy cow!</i>
- Jesus.
- Thanks, X!
<i>- Did you see that?!</i>
- That's Captain A.
<i>It was LaFlamme who ran into
and decked Cain!</i>
Flammer's loaded for bear.
<i>Here comes LaFlamme,
makes a move around the defender,</i>
<i>moves right in on the goal.</i>
<i>Magic hands.
Great save by Nicholai.</i>
Watch Flammer's back. Do what
you gotta do, but keep it clean.
<i>Six minutes left
in the third period.</i>
<i>Halifax and Reading
still tied at a goal apiece.</i>
- Take ice away! Come on!
<i>- Here's Anders Cain.</i>
<i>- Cain gets it over to Totan.</i>
- Get on the puck!
<i>Totan looks back,
returns it to Cain.</i>
What is this you're doing?
Make shoot!
<i>Cain seems to be
in the midst of</i>
<i>some sort of psycho-athletic
fugue state.</i>
Fuckin' make shoot!
<i>Mother of God!</i>
- Holy snappin' arseholes.
- What the fuck's he doing?
- Right off his rocker.
- What's he fuckin' doing?
What the fuck?
<i>Cain seems to have actually
fired the puck</i>
<i>into his father's
loge accommodations.</i>
You gonna call that or what?
<i>Now Anders Cain
takes a shot at LaFlamme.</i>
- Come on!
<i>- LaFlamme punches back at Cain.</i>
<i>Ross Rhea steps in.
Cain gives a right.</i>
What the fuck was that?
I'm gonna teach you
some fuckin' manners, son.
<i>He has gone absolutely bonkers
in this game here tonight.</i>
<i>Now he goes to the penalty box.
So does Ross Rhea.</i>
Fuck you, Cain!
<i>Halifax number three, Ross Rhea,</i>
<i>Reading number 13, Anders Cain.</i>
- Getting tired?
- Dude, I'm always tired.
'Cause you're
an old piece of shit.
You got me there.
This old piece of shit's gonna
take your fuckin' head off.
Rhea! Get your ass
back to the bench!
We're gonna
kill this thing.
Good luck, kid.
<i>The two combatants
step back out on the ice...</i>
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
<i>and immediately
Rhea begins to chase Cain.</i>
Rhea!
<i>The puck is still in
Reading territory.</i>
<i>Now it's knocked back
to the blue line.</i>
<i>Here's a shot on goal.
A save is made.</i>
<i>Puck goes into the corner.
Rhea goes in after it.</i>
- Anders, no.
<i>- And going after Rhea is Cain.</i>
No!
I told you you'd end up in
a fucking ambulance.
- You fucking piece of shit!
- Get the fuck out of here, Cain.
<i>Rhea is down. He's bloodied.</i>
<i>He may well be unconscious.</i>
Motherfucker!
Let's get the board out.
Let's get him on the stretcher.
<i>They're bringing out
the stretcher.</i>
<i>Rhea is down, folks.
He's bleeding.</i>
<i>This doesn't look good.</i>
Hm.
- Doug.
- Shit.
OK, up, back down. OK.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Doug 'The Thug' Glatt
is entering the fray.</i>
<i>He's making a beeline
for Anders Cain.</i>
<i>This could only mean one thing.</i>
I thought you didn't need to
fight me, Doug.
Lay him the fuck out, kid.
Doug...
This is for someone else.
<i>Cain and Glatt going at each other
one after the other.</i>
<i>One, two, three.</i>
<i>Oh, he hammers Glatt.</i>
- Fuck.
<i>- Blood spews.</i>
Oh!
<i>And these guys are being
left to their own devices.</i>
- Yes!
<i>- These men are wild.</i>
<i>They're crazy.
There's blood everywhere.</i>
Attaboy, Dougie.
I'm glad you came back, Doug!
Come on!
<i>Oh, blood and gore
all over the floor!</i>
<i>The linesmen
are nowhere to be seen.</i>
<i>You can't blame them.</i>
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
Do it. Do it, Doug.
Take his fucking head off!
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
Do it.
No.
It's over.
It's never over.
We're gonna do this
night after night...
game after fucking game.
You hear me, Doug?
Game after fucking game!
Look up there, Doug.
Look at 'em! This is it!
This is what
they want us to do!
I do whatever my team
needs me to do.
We're just gonna keep
fucking bleeding out here...
Doug.
over and over again
until they cart
every fucking last one of us
off the fucking ice!
- Doug!
- Dougie!
Jesus, Dougie. Are you OK?
Not really,
but thanks for askin'.
Right there. Right there.
Anders, can you hear me?
Hey, hey.
It's OK.
I fucking...
hate this sport.
Oh, righto.
One, two, three.
- Don't hate me, here.
- I don't hate you, Parky.
I could never hate you.
Highlanders!
Highlanders! Highlanders!
<i>There's only seconds left
and nothing is settled.</i>
<i>As LaFlamme moves through
the neutral zone,</i>
<i>gets in across the line,</i>
<i>he's got Stevenson
on his flank.</i>
Highlanders! Highlanders!
Highlanders! Highlanders!
<i>LaFlamme's now
moving in toward Totan.</i>
<i>Five seconds left.</i>
<i>Stevenson is there...</i>
<i>LaFlamme moving in...</i>
Excalibur!
<i>Stevenson scores! They did it!
The Highlanders win!</i>
<i>The Highlanders win!</i>
<i>For just the second time
in 10 years,</i>
<i>the Halifax Highlanders
are going to the play-offs!</i>
