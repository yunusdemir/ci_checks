- Red Baron Control. Red Baron Five.
- Go ahead, Red Baron Five.
Roger. Orbiting southeast corner
of sector Alpha Charlie.
We've spotted what appears to be
a spacecraft just outside the surf line.
Alert rescue. Advise we can
remain on station for 45 minutes.
- Will squawk 7700 for a radar fix.
- Roger.
Rescue, I have Red Baron Five report
of possible spacecraft offshore,
southeast sector Alpha Charlie.
Launch chopper. Effect pickup
and recovery. Base radar will vector.
Everybody out! Let's move.
Come on, let's go.
Sergeant, get that half-track here
and get a cable to those frogmen.
Yes, sir!
The general, sir.
- Anybody in that thing?
- I don't know, sir. We just beached it.
- All right, open her up.
- Open it up!
Welcome, gentlemen, to the United St...
- Did you call the zoo?
- Yes, sir. We're in luck.
The sick bay's almost empty except for
a mauled fox cub and a depressed gorilla.
The apes'll be hidden from the public
and quarantined.
If they need medical attention,
it's available.
The experts can give them
the once-over tomorrow.
- General Brody's very pleased.
- Oh, me too.
We can't let a lot of monkeys
leave their messes on the floor.
Have they been fed? Raw steak?
The zoo tells me that chimpanzees,
like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
- They suggested oranges.
- Good God!
What's the matter, Corporal?
Oh, excuse me. I didn't mean
to disturb you while you're dressing.
- What the hell am I saying?
- They're pretending to dress, sir.
What do you mean? They are dressing!
- Where are the clothes from?
- They brought them.
- What?
- In that suitcase.
Greg, maybe you should
give "em their oranges.
Well, they're...
They're going to the zoo infirmary.
Arrange for a police escort at 1630 hours.
They'll have company there.
There's a gorilla in the next cage.
Why did it do that?
Here you are, little fella.
Boy, you really are sick.
Hello, missy. Have a banana.
Have it your own way, mate.
- Zira!
- I'm not his mate, I'm yours.
Control yourself.
I think they're trying to be kind.
This cage stinks of gorilla.
Cornelius, where are we?
What's happened?
I know where we are.
I know what has happened.
In some fashion,
and I lack the intellect
to know precisely how,
we have traveled from
Earth's future to Earth's past.
But we saw the Earth destroyed.
And Earth will be destroyed,
just as we saw it.
Only, since seeing it, we have passed
through a backward disturbance in time.
Did you notice the date meter clicking
down after the shock wave hit our ship?
Yes.
We returned to Earth nearly
2,000 years before its destruction.
That is another reason for us
to keep silent.
Our human captors
will not be edified to learn
that their world will crack like an egg
and burn to a cinder
because of an ape war of aggression.
Apes, at this instant in time,
cannot yet talk.
For the moment,
we should follow their example.
The driver gave me this report
from the air base.
Better read it before we start the test.
Yeah, it's the usual imitated behavior.
Mimicking salutes, handshaking,
eating off plates with knives.
What is it?
- There was a carpetbag in the ship.
- Full of food?
No, clothes. And it seems
they changed into them.
I don't believe it!
Hi, Dr Dixon. Dr Branton.
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning.
- The female's a bit uppity, sir.
- OK, I'll be careful.
I see you've prepared the Wisconsin
Multiphasic. We'll begin with that.
Go easy now, Stevie.
Oh, they look pretty docile to me.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
Unless the craft was remotely controlled,
they must have been conditioned to push
the right buttons. They can't be morons.
All right, we'll take the female first.
Arthur, would you set up a...
Well, she seems to be pretty smart.
All right, let's make it more difficult.
- They... haven't had their breakfast yet?
- Not a bite, just as you ordered.
Good. We'll go for the banana.
Well, why doesn't she take it?
Because I loathe bananas!
Zira!
- I don't believe it.
- Yes.
Arthur, I think Dr Branton needs some air.
- Zira, are you mad?
- Dr Milo, please do not call my wife mad!
I did not call her mad, I merely asked her
if she was. And I repeat: are you mad?
I hate deceit!
Well, there is a time for truth
and a time, not for lies, but for silence.
Until we know who our friends are...
How in the name of God are we
to know that unless we communicate?
- We can speak, so I spoke.
- And we can listen.
- To a lot of psychiatric small talk.
- And we can watch!
- A display of primitive apparatus.
- It couldn't test the intelligence of a newt!
- Calm yourself.
- I am calm!
- Zira!
- Stop arguing!
It's too late for that.
Use your heads and start thinking.
Now that they know we can speak,
how much will we tell them?
Milo!
We'll need a full autopsy.
With emphasis on the cranial
and oral areas.
Let us know when the report
comes in, will you, please?
I'd better do this alone.
We mean you no harm.
Do you understand? We will not hurt you.
Poor Doctor Milo.
- Doctor?
- Yes, "Doctor." And you killed him.
No, I didn't. He did.
- One of your own kind.
- He's a gorilla.
Well, look, there's nothing to be afraid of.
He's in chains. He's under sedation.
Do you understand that?
I should. I've been doing it
half my life to humans.
- Humans?
- I'm a psychiatrist.
Oh, I'm a psychiatrist, too.
Do you... have a name?
My name is Cornelius.
This is my wife, Zira.
And I'm Lewis. Lewis Dixon.
Nobody's gonna believe this.
- Believe what?
- That primitive apes can talk.
- Primitive?
- Well, I mean that in our...
primitive civilization, apes just don't talk.
I mean, I think it's important
that when our primitive
security precautions are lifted,
that the first time
you say anything in public,
you should talk to
what we primitively call the right people.
May I say something... personal?
Please.
I like you.
I have from the beginning.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Mr President.
I'm aware that what I have to say may
create a credibility gap
wider than the Grand Canyon.
Nonetheless, it is true.
Yesterday, a US spacecraft splashed
down off the southern California coast.
It was one of two that have been
missing in space for over two years.
To be exact, the one
commanded by Colonel Taylor.
- Have they identified the bodies?
- They have identified three bodies, yes.
All living...
- Taylor's alive?
...at the time of their rescue.
Through an unfortunate accident, one was
killed this morning in the Los Angeles Zoo.
Zoo?
What would astronauts
be doing in a zoo, Mr President?
They are not astronauts, General Faulkner.
They are apes.
Chimpanzees, to be more precise.
They're harmless, friendly,
and, by all reports,
extremely intelligent and sophisticated.
But, naturally, being animals,
they cannot tell us
where the ship came from
or how they came to be in it.
I have therefore decided to convene
a Presidential Commission of Inquiry
in Los Angeles tomorrow.
The two surviving apes will be presented
to the commission for their inspection.
The press will be invited
to attend, not to participate.
I don't believe that we can
withhold this extraordinary discovery
from the world any longer.
One of the two American spaceships
believed to have disintegrated in orbit
splashed down yesterday in the Pacific
Ocean, off the coast of southern California,
and is stated to have been manned,
if you can call it "manned," by monkeys.
I have nothing to say, gentlemen.
I haven't got time now. A little later.
Here comes the chairman.
As the president's science advisor,
what do you expect to experience
from this historic meeting?
Fear.
All right now. After I break the news,
I want you to start slowly with simple
answers to what will be simple questions.
And if the questions become less simple?
- Be yourself.
- Your better self, Zira. Please?
- They're ready, sir.
- All right, it's time.
What do they think we are? Gorillas?
I'm sorry.
That's it. Just be seated.
Mr Chairman,
members of the commission,
ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Lewis Dixon.
I am the animal psychiatrist
who has been in charge of these two apes
since they came to the Los Angeles Zoo.
My associate, Dr Stephanie Branton,
and I are ready to answer your questions.
What may astonish you is that
our chimpanzee friends are ready
to answer your questions, too.
Not by signs, not by looks or movements,
but by words.
Dr Dixon. As a zoologist,
I know and respect your work,
but if you want to turn
a Presidential Inquiry
into a ventriloquist's act,
I have to inform you...
And I have to inform you that
these apes have the power of speech.
Come, now. You know as well as I do
their brain system is not developed in
either the vocal or abstract-thinking area.
Yes, sir, but they do have
the power of speech,
and it is for you gentlemen to assess
how far that power
can be exercised intelligently.
May we be told which
is the female of the species?
Did she rise as a reflex to you
having indicated her,
or in answer to my question?
That's for you to decide.
- Have you a name?
- Zira.
Certainly she can articulate,
which in itself is extraordinary.
But, Dr Dixon,
are we to infer that Zira is her name,
or some phrase in her own language?
Infer what you will, Mr Chairman.
I suggest you rephrase the question.
What is your name?
- One might as well be talking to a parrot.
- A parrot?
Mechanical mimicry.
Unique in an ape vocally, without a doubt.
But... does the other one talk?
Only when she lets me.
- Dr Hasslein.
- No. Nothing.
- Mr Chairman.
- Yes.
What is the male's name, please?
- Cornelius.
- My lawfully wedded spouse.
- Wedded?
- We'll take that up later, Your Eminence.
Cornelius, do you and
your lawfully wedded spouse
speak any language other than English?
What is English?
I speak the language taught to me by my
parents, who were taught by their parents.
It has been the language
of our ancestors for nearly 2,000 years.
As to its origins, who can be sure?
The gorillas and orangutans
of our community
believe that God created the ape
in His own image, and that our language...
Nonsense!
Cornelius, as an intellectual, you know
the gorillas are militaristic nincompoops
and the orangutans, a bunch
of blinkered, pseudoscientific geese!
As to humans, I've dissect...
I've examined thousands of them,
and, until now, I've only
discovered two who could talk in my life.
God knows who taught them.
Where we come from, apes talk.
Humans are dumb.
- Where do you come from, Cornelius?
- I'm not sure.
Dr Milo was sure.
Dr Milo was a genius
well in advance of his time.
When the spacecraft first landed on our
seaboard, it was Dr Milo who salvaged it.
He studied it and half understood it.
Half? Was half enough?
It was enough for us to escape
when war became inevitable.
Enough for Dr Milo
to be murdered in your zoo.
Enough for my wife and I to be here now.
- From where, Cornelius?
- I told you. I'm not sure.
Maybe the female knows.
Of course "the female" knows.
We came from your future.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's the only thing that does.
- Mr Chairman.
- Yes.
Cornelius. You spoke of war.
- War between whom?
- The gorillas and whoever lives...
Lived. Will live.
- Who won the war?
- I don't know.
The chimpanzees are pacifists.
We stayed at home.
- But you left before the war had ended.
- In a spaceship.
- Which Dr Milo learned to navigate.
- Correct.
Cornelius, did you know a Colonel Taylor?
No. Is he a soldier?
We are peaceful creatures.
We are happy to be here.
May we be unchained?
- Gentlemen, do you have anything to say?
- No comment.
No comment.
- Mr Chairman, a word.
- Here's one: preposterous.
- Can you define that?
- No, just let me say this
as head of this commission. We will
examine the facts of this bizarre affair
and pass our conclusions on to
the president for implementation.
What a load of huggermugger.
No comment.
- How will you advise the president?
- No comment.
Could you tell us how you
personally would handle it?
No, gentlemen. No comment.
Yet.
- You were fabulous!
- Marvelous. All that applause, but...
But... there was a moment...
- There was. When he started to ask...
- Zira.
- Cornelius, I think we should tell them.
- No.
- But only to Lewis and Stevie.
- Oh, Zira.
I have to be honest with someone.
Cornelius, please.
You tell them.
Well, you see...
We did know Colonel Taylor.
We came to love him.
What harm could there be
in telling that to the commission?
Where we come from,
apes did not love humans.
They... hunted them for sport,
much as you would animals.
Yes, we used their bodies,
alive and dead, experimentally.
For anatomical dissection
and scientific research.
Well...
We do the same thing to animals.
I mean, as a scientist I sympathize, but
I agree that's a revelation
the masses would not take kindly to.
I think you did the right thing
in denying knowledge of Colonel Taylor.
There was another reason.
What?
They would have asked
if he was still alive.
- And is he?
- Oh, no. He can't be.
- How do you know?
- Cos...
From the windows of the spaceship...
We saw the Earth...
destroyed.
Stand by.
Good evening.
This is Bill Bonds in Los Angeles.
The biggest story since the moon landing
broke when two apes talked,
I repeat, talked to
the Presidential Commission of Inquiry.
With me this evening is Dr Otto Hasslein.
He is a senior scientific advisor
at the White House.
He'll give his views on the crucial
statement made at today's session.
Dr Hasslein, as I recall, when you
asked the male ape where he was from,
- the female replied "From your future."
- Yes.
Do you believe that?
Absolutely.
I think it is the only explanation.
Maybe the explanation
needs some explaining.
You've written several learned
dissertations on the nature of time.
Could you explain,
in terms we can understand,
how, for instance, a person, or persons,
could travel from time past to time future,
or, indeed, vice versa?
Mr Bonds, I think time
can only be fully understood
by an observer with a godlike
gift of infinite regression.
Could you explain
"infinite regression" for us?
- Roll the film.
- I came prepared to do just that.
Now, here's a painting of a landscape.
Now, the artist who painted that picture
says "Something is missing. What is it?"
"It is I myself who was
part of the landscape I painted."
So he mentally takes a step backward,
or regresses, and paints a picture of the
artist painting a picture of the landscape.
But still something is missing.
That is still his real self
painting the second picture.
So he regresses further, and paints a third.
A picture of the artist painting a picture
of the artist painting a picture
of the landscape.
And because something is still missing,
he paints a fourth and a fifth
until he paints a picture
of the artist painting a picture
of the artist painting a picture
of the artist painting a picture
of the artist painting a landscape.
So infinite regression, then, is...
The moment when our artist has
regressed to the point of infinity
and is part of the landscape he painted,
and is both the observer and the observed.
In that peculiar condition,
what would he be observing
if he were observing, let's say, time?
He would perceive
that time is like a freeway
with an infinite number of lanes,
all leading from the past into the future,
however, not into the same future.
A driver in lane A may crash,
while a driver in lane B survives.
It follows that a driver,
by changing lanes, can change his future.
It is not difficult to believe that in the dark
and turbulent corridors of outer space,
the impact of some distant planetary,
even galactic, disaster
jumped the apes
from their present into ours.
Indeed, the proof lies
in their arrival among us
and in their spoken testimony.
Thank you very much, Dr Hasslein.
It's the most incredible story
this reporter has ever covered.
By their intelligence and good humor,
the so-called "ape-onauts"
have already captured the hearts
of the American nation.
They will not be required to appear
before the commission tomorrow.
That hearing is going to be held in private.
They will, however, be taken
from the zoo infirmary to a hotel
and given an extended tour of the city.
This is Bill Bonds, reporting
for Eyewitness News. Good night.
Good night.
- Your luggage, ma'am?
- Of course it's mine!
Address, please?
The zoo.
40.
May I measure your inside leg, sir?
- No!
- Oh.
Dr Cornelius.
Tell me, how do you find our women?
Very human.
Very good!
Excuse me.
Madam Zira, I represent
Fur and Feather, a pet magazine...
Do you think I'm a pet?
Well, yes, I do rather.
Say, why don't you try some?
- What is it?
- It's sort of like grape juice plus.
Wait, just a sip.
Madam Zira, what is your favorite fruit?
Grape.
And that's the way it was tonight
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
Tomorrow, Zira is to speak
at the Bay Area Women's Club.
She'll then accompany Dr Hasslein
to the Museum of Natural History.
Meanwhile, Cornelius will attend
a prizefight - that's his first one.
Later, he'll visit Disneyland to dedicate
a new boat for the Jungle Cruise.
Now for a look at the weather. Sunny
California will not be that tomorrow.
Clouds will cover the coastal area
with light showers predicted.
- Tired?
- A little.
How is that?
Soothing.
But very wet.
A marriage bed is made for two,
but every damn morning,
it's the woman who has to make it.
We have heads as well as hands.
I call upon men to let us use them.
How do you like it, Cornelius?
Beastly.
We are now approaching Antrodemus
valens Leidy, a giant flesh-eating dinosaur.
Its scientific name is a compound
of the Greek antron, which means hollow,
and demus, which means body frame,
referring to the backbone or vertebra.
Now, this little fellow
is Camptosaurus Marsh,
a primitive duck-billed dinosaur.
Its scientific name is a compound of the
Greek campto,
which means flexible or bent,
and saurus, which means lizard.
Its generic name therefore
is "flexible lizard."
In 1879, OC Marsh of Yale University
described the first known species
from the Jurassic beds of Wyoming.
Other specimens
have been found throughout...
- It must have been the shock.
- Shock, my foot!
I'm pregnant.
I shan't leave you until Cornelius is back.
- No, no.
- No, I insist. Please sit down.
Now, is there anything I can get you, Zira?
Well... I have a strange craving...
That is only natural.
...for Grape Juice Plus.
- Grape Juice Plus.
- It's in the refrigerator.
All right.
Is this it?
Here we are.
Lewis said only a sip.
Zira, it is an excellent restorative,
I assure you,
especially in cases of pregnancy,
you know?
- How long have you known?
- Oh, since well before the war.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Oh, no. I shouldn't.
Not in view of your condition.
Who won your war?
It wasn't our war. It was the gorillas" war.
Chimpanzees are pashi...
Pacifists.
We stayed behind.
We never saw the enemy.
- But which side won?
- Neither.
But how do you know that
if you weren't there?
When we were in space,
we saw a bright, white, blinding light.
And then we saw
the rim of the Earth melt.
And then there was a tornado in the sky.
I feel magnificently sleepy.
The date meter on the spaceship.
What did it read after Earth's destruction?
Nineteen...
seventy... three.
And before?
Before the white light and the tornado?
Thirty-nine...
fifty... something.
- Before the white light and the tornado?
- Thirty-nine...
fifty... something.
- So?
- You have evidence, Mr President,
that one day talking apes
will dominate this Earth
and destroy it by 3950-something.
I doubt that we shall
still be in office by then.
And according to the NASA experts,
who are still subjecting
the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny,
the precise year of what
you merely infer to be Earth's destruction
is recorded on the flight synthesizer
as 3955.
AD, presumably.
Now, what do you expect me
and the United Nations,
though not necessarily
in that order, to do about it?
Alter what you believe to be the future
by slaughtering two innocents,
or rather three,
now that one of them is pregnant?
Herod tried that and Christ survived.
- Herod lacked our facilities.
- He also became very unpopular.
Historically unpopular.
And we don't want that to happen, do we?
- Are you saying...
- I am saying that our two visitors
seem to be very charming,
peaceful people,
or rather, creatures,
and the voters love them.
Do you want their progeny
to dominate the world?
Well, not at the next election, no.
But, one day, if the progeny turn out
as well as the parents, who knows?
They may do a better job of it
than we have.
- By destroying the world?
Are you quite sure that what
they saw destroyed was the world?
Well, aren't you?
I consider it dispassionately
as a possibility.
Not hysterically as a fact.
We have their own testimony
that they provoked the war.
And they seem to have
provoked you into the bargain.
I'm not saying that you're wrong, Hasslein,
but before I have them shot against a wall
I want convincing that the handwriting
on the wall is calculably true.
Now... convince me.
By their own testimony, we know
that apes will acquire
the power of intelligent speech.
By Zira's testimony,
we know that she's pregnant with child.
By my testimony, we know it
is genetically possible for this child,
provided that we permit its birth,
to bear or beget
a talking ape by a dumb one
in a present-day jungle
or a present-day zoo.
But do you truly believe
that by deliberate present-day action
we can neutralize
that possibility and alter the future?
- Yes, Mr President, I do.
- Do you also believe that we should?
Given the power to alter the future,
have we the right to use it?
I don't know.
I've wrestled with this,
Mr President, and I don't know.
How many futures are there?
Which future has God, if there is a God,
chosen for man's destiny?
If I urge the destruction of these two apes,
am I defying God's will or obeying it?
- Am I His enemy or His instrument?
- An assassin would say the latter.
Do you approve of assassination?
We condoned the attempted assassination
of Hitler because he was evil.
Would we have approved killing him
in babyhood when he was innocent,
or killing his mother,
or slaughtering his remote ancestors?
We have no proof that these apes are evil.
- There are very strong indications.
- Such as?
The discrepancies in their answers
to the commission
- suggest that, if properly interrogated...
- Are you suggesting that they weren't?
- Unprofessionally.
- You want it professional?
- The full works.
- Tell that to the commission.
I'll abide by their findings.
Having convened in secret session
at the request of the president,
the commission makes
these interim recommendations.
One: the public should be
informed that the apes,
after their arduous space voyage and
the fatigue arising from its publicity,
are to be afforded rest in a location whose
identity will not be divulged to the public.
Two: since, however, there is
justifiable cause for suspecting
that they have withheld
vital information from us,
the ape-onauts will in fact
be escorted by Dr Lewis Dixon
to the installation known as Camp 11,
held there in his care
for interrogation by the CIA
under the guidance and supervision
of Dr Otto Hasslein.
When we were in space,
we saw a bright, white, blinding light...
Brighter than this?
Then we saw the rim of the Earth melt.
Then there was a tornado in the sky.
That's your voice, isn't it?
How can I tell? I don't even remember.
- Why don't you remember?
- Because Dr Hasslein made me drunk.
Why tell him something when drunk
that you never told the commission
when sober?
Because you were frightened for the safety
of yourselves and your unborn child?
- I withheld nothing. Nobody asked me.
- But if somebody had asked?
I should have said that chimpanzees
had no part in the destruction of Earth.
Only the gorillas and the orangutans.
What's the difference? You're all monkeys.
Please! Do not say "monkey."
It is offensive.
As an archaeologist, I saw history scrolls
which were kept secret from the masses,
and I suspect that the weapon which
destroyed Earth was man's own invention.
I do know this. One of the reasons
for man's original downfall
was your peculiar habit
of murdering one another.
Man destroys man.
Apes do not destroy apes.
Cornelius.
This is not an interracial hassle,
but a search for facts.
We do not deny the possibility
of man's decline and fall.
All we want to find out is how apes rose.
Well...
It began in our prehistory
- with the plague that fell upon dogs.
- And cats.
Hundreds and thousands of them died.
Hundreds and thousands
of them had to be destroyed
in order to prevent the spread of infection.
- There were dog bonfires.
- Yes.
And by the time the plague was contained,
man was without pets.
Of course, for man this was intolerable.
I mean, he might kill his brother,
but he could not kill his dog.
So humans took primitive apes as pets.
Primitive and dumb, but still 20 times
more intelligent than dogs or cats.
Correct.
They were quartered in cages, but they
lived and moved freely in human homes.
They became responsive
to human speech, and,
in the course of less than two centuries,
they progressed from
performing mere tricks
to performing services.
Nothing more or less
than a well-trained sheepdog could do.
Could a sheepdog cook?
Or clean the house?
Or do the marketing for the groceries with
a list from its mistress? Or wait on tables?
Or, after three more centuries,
turn the tables on their owners?
How?
They became alert
to the concept of slavery.
And, as their numbers grew, to slavery's
antidote which, of course, is unity.
At first, they began
assembling in small groups.
They learned the art of
corporate and militant action.
They learned to refuse.
At first, they just grunted their refusal.
But then, on an historic day,
which is commemorated by my species
and fully documented in the sacred scrolls,
there came Aldo.
He did not grunt. He articulated.
He spoke a word which had been spoken
to him time without number by humans.
He said...
"No."
So that's how it all started.
Clip one, please.
Where we come from, apes talk.
Humans are dumb.
You recognize your husband's
words to the commission?
Yes.
So humans were dumb. Were they happy?
Clip two.
As to humans, I've dissec...
I've examined thousands of them,
and, until now, I've only discovered
two who could talk in my life.
Why did you change words
in the middle of the sentence?
Repeat first three seconds of clip two.
As to humans, I've dissec...
I've examined...
- What was the word you didn't finish?
- I can't remember.
Play the loop.
- Complete the word, monkey!
- I told you...
Complete the word!
It sounds as if I had hiccups.
Call for Dr Dixon, please.
Dr Dixon! Dr Hasslein calling Dr Dixon.
Calling Dr Dixon!
Ah, Dr Dixon. Come in.
Be good enough to administer
this to the female.
- Why? What is it?
- Sodium Pentothal. One half gram I.V.
- Dr Hasslein, I'm an animal psychiatrist...
- And a qualified vet.
We have the commission's authority.
And that of the president. Please.
Zira, I've been asked
to give you an injection...
No, you can't use that!
We only use those things for killing.
- Killing?
- No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.
This is for relaxing. It won't harm her.
- Will it harm my baby?
- No. No, it won't.
So, Zira, if you would just
come with me, please.
- Lewis, you can't use that on Zira!
- I promise...
- Please take him to his quarters.
- Lewis, you...
No, you mustn't!
Please.
Just lie down on the couch.
And bare your arm, please.
You don't have to tell me.
This has the same effect
as Grape Juice Plus.
Now count backward from ten.
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six...
five...
four...
What comes after four?
Two.
- Thank you, Dr Dixon.
- It's customary to stay.
You worked in a room like this?
Bigger. Not so pretty.
And there you practiced...
Comparative.
Comparative what?
Anatomy?
Whose anatomies did you compare?
Apes and humans?
Zira, say "yes" if you mean yes.
Yes.
So you dissected other apes?
Yes. When they died a natural death.
- And humans too, of course.
- Yes.
As they were made available.
Available?
The gorillas hunted them for sport,
with nets and with guns.
The survivors were put in cages.
The army used some of them
for target practice.
We could take our scientific pick
of the rest.
And, in the interest of science,
you dissected,
removed and statistically compared...
Bones, muscles, tendons,
veins, arteries, kidneys, livers, hearts,
stomachs, reproductive organs,
nails, tongues,
eyes, noses, nervous systems,
the various reflexes...
Reflexes? Of the dead?
No, no. Of the living!
You can't make a dead man's knee jump
any more than you can test a corpse's
reaction to a prefrontal lobotomy!
You mean you were advanced enough
to perform experimental
brain surgery on living humans?
Oh, yes!
We even tried to stimulate
their atrophied speech centers.
Did you try to stimulate
Colonel Taylor's speech center?
Of course not! He could talk already.
When you left,
was Colonel Taylor still alive?
We loved Taylor.
We did all we could to help him,
Cornelius and I.
- Cornelius!
- She should have a nap now.
She'll get it.
- Orderly.
- Sir?
Please take the female ape to its quarters.
Yes, sir.
We have to get this
to the commission immediately.
Gentlemen.
I've received an official
notification from the president,
ratifying the recommendations
made by this commission
in light of the tape recordings
delivered to us by Dr Hasslein.
Now, if you'll just be seated,
we'll get right down to business.
Now, let me review our conclusions.
One: by a majority vote, the commission
finds no solid evidence for hostility
by either ape towards humans
as at present constituted
in this year of our Lord 1973.
Let me remind you
that this was by a majority vote.
The male's attitude is that
of a well-disposed academician
who studied the alleged
downfall of the human race
with the true objectivity
of a good historian.
The female's case is different in that she
committed actions against the human race
of a sort which, if committed today,
would be called atrocities.
But would they be so called
in 2,000 years" time
when it is alleged that humans
will have become dumb brutes
with the restricted intelligence of animals?
It has been pointed out
that what apes will do to humans
is no more than what humans
are now doing to beasts.
Nonetheless, the commission is
sympathetic to Dr Hasslein's conviction
that the progeny of these apes
could in centuries to come
prove an increasing threat
to the human race
and conceivably end by dominating it.
This is a risk we dare not ignore.
Therefore, the commission
unanimously recommends
that the birth of the female ape's
unborn child should be prevented
and, after its prenatal removal,
both the male and female
should humanely be rendered incapable
of bearing another.
I now declare this commission dissolved.
Savages! They are savages!
Jabbing needles into my pregnant wife!
I've done that too, dear. And worse.
Taylor thought we were savages at first.
Did they make you tell them
about Taylor, too?
They made me tell them
everything, Cornelius.
Brutes!
Shall I tell you something?
I'm glad I did. We can't live with lies.
After this, I doubt we shall
be allowed to live at all.
Do you mean that?
How long?
A week. Maybe sooner.
They treated you like dirt.
Ma'am. Sir. Chow time.
I'm not hungry.
Well, maybe somebody else is
who can't talk yet.
Come on, ma'am. It's pure vitamin C.
You better have your soup and oranges
for the sake of that little monkey.
- No, Cornelius!
- Nobody makes a fool out of my wife.
- But ought we to call for...
- We just ought to leave.
I'll be going back with Dr Hasslein soon.
I'm the one who has to tell them.
- Stevie, you gotta come help me.
- Of course. I'll come right away.
It just seems so cruel and horrible and...
I don't know. I'll see you.
- Cruel, Dr Dixon?
- Unbelievably. Zira wants her baby.
- So do I.
- But dead.
Yes.
You'd prefer the parents dead, too.
Shall we go?
Gate four.
Just a minute, sir. I'll take a look.
No, sir. The lieutenant hasn't checked in.
- Night, Charlie.
- Night, Ed.
Yes, sir, I'll tell him. "Contact the motor
pool." Yes, sir. Just as soon as I see him.
Gate four.
Oh, yes, Captain.
No, sir. The supply truck
isn't due until 0600 hours.
- Well, I'm sorry, sir.
- Good night, Charlie.
I said good night.
We haven't any way
to contact him until then.
The depot's closed, sir.
OK, sir. I'll be off duty,
but the relief comes on at 0430 hours
and I'll get him to pass the message.
Yes, sir.
Zira, what's the matter?
I think my pains have begun.
Oh, my dear.
Administration, Doctor. It's urgent.
- What happened?
- The apes killed their orderly.
- Where are they?
- On the run.
Now they've killed,
and for that they must be killed.
It has to be done before
we start a stone rolling
that'll gather enough
poison moss to kill us all!
Look. I'm going back to the camp.
I'm going to find Lewis and get help.
- No!
- Zira!
I just lost my temper with the boy.
Now, they may...
- It's better now. I can walk.
- Listen to me!
They may punish us for what we did,
but at least the baby will be born.
- Were they armed?
- No, I don't believe so.
Then there will be
no need for a shooting match.
- Not strictly speaking, no.
- I am speaking strictly, Hasslein.
Science regards these apes as unique.
The people regard them
as practically human.
Then they must be told that today's killers
could be tomorrow's mass murderers.
Of course they must. I can think of no one
better equipped emotionally than yourself
to persuade them of that possibility.
But, in a democracy, we do not
shoot unarmed suspects on sight
for a murder in which their
participation is still unproven.
I want them taken, yes. But taken alive!
- Is that clear?
- Quite clear, Mr President.
You lost, miss?
Oh, it's you, Dr Branton.
You better be careful.
There's been a murder.
- Murder?
- Yes, ma'am.
The monkeys have killed
their orderly and escaped.
What? I don't believe it.
How did it happen?
I don't know. All I know is
they've killed their orderly
and I have orders to find them.
Drive carefully, Dr Branton. There'll
be a lot of vehicles in the area tonight.
- Cornelius, what have you done?
- I didn't mean to kill him.
He was teasing Zira, and I thought I'd just
hit him with a tray. Please believe me.
I do, Cornelius, I do. But they won't.
- Where's Zira?
- She's back there, hiding in the bushes.
Stevie, she's in labor.
Oh, God. Get in.
Stevie... you won't take us
back to the camp?
Get down. I have a better idea.
Now wait a second. Just a moment.
Let me get this straight.
You are asking me to risk imprisonment
for the sake of two fugitive apes?
The answer is a thousand times
yes. Oh, yes.
I do it for you. And for Stevie.
- And for your two distinguished friends.
- Notorious now.
To hell with notoriety!
What is a husband expected to do?
Stand by and see his wife insulted?
Good God! Aren't we rude enough
to each other
without having to be rude to animals?
And, anyway, he didn't mean
to kill the boy. It was an accident.
I appreciate what you're doing, Armando.
Well, you helped deliver our last baby
and now you will deliver our next.
Lewis! What took you so long?
I had to work out some excuse.
They think I'm searching.
- Armando's been a saint.
- Oh, a minor one.
- Saint Francis would have fixed it better.
- Never!
Say hello to Heloise.
- And your goddaughter, Salome.
- Hello, Salome.
- The first chimp ever born in a circus.
- No, Los Angeles has had four.
- Los Angeles is not a circus. It's a zoo.
- So New Yorkers say.
Lewis is here.
Lewis. I was not responsible
for the death...
I know. But you will be
responsible for a birth.
- How is she?
- The pains are every five minutes now.
Every four.
Look. Look at Heloise.
She's showing an expectant mother
what to expect.
Mama.
Say it.
Don't waste your breath and strength.
You know that the child of two primitive
apes will never learn how to speak.
I'm getting into practice.
There, that's good.
Come on.
What are we gonna call...
Him.
Milo?
Congratulations.
No?
But, sir...
Captain, I'm fully aware that you've
canvassed the areas we first established.
Evidently we were wrong
because you haven't found them yet!
Thank you.
Now, Dr Dixon, can you pinpoint the date
of the baby's birth
with any degree of accuracy?
Well, I never examined her.
But, from appearances,
I'd say a week to ten days.
If it's that close, she can't
have gone far. Where do apes go?
To other apes.
Of course.
Captain, start an immediate
and systematic search
of every menagerie, every zoo,
every circus in the city.
I'll augment your force
with the city police.
And keep me informed about results,
- whether positive or negative.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, Lewis will think of something.
- I am so sorry. I had planned it all so well.
In just one month, we move on
to our winter quarters in Florida.
I could have released you in
the Everglades and, my dear friends,
you might have lived happily ever after.
But now... what can I do?
You have done enough
to make us grateful to you for ever.
I did it because I like
chimpanzees best of all apes.
And you, the best of all chimpanzees.
I did it because I hate those
who try to alter destiny,
which is the unalterable will of God.
And if it is man's destiny
one day to be dominated,
then, oh, please, God, let him
be dominated by such as you.
All I can now do to help you
is give you this... for the baby.
- It's a medal of Saint Francis ofAssisi.
- Who is he?
He was a holy man who loved
and cared for all animals.
Oh, thank you.
We'll hang it around
the baby's neck. For protection, huh?
- Thank you.
- Yes.
And now, my dear, dear friends,
before the police come
and the audience gathers,
you and your pretty baby must go.
Lewis is on his way.
- Armando.
- Yes?
I should like to say goodbye
to Heloise first.
If only she could speak,
she would say how sorry she is.
I know. But we understand each other.
All right.
This is as far as we dare to take you.
The police have road blocks
on every main exit from town.
- Here are your supplies.
- Thank you.
- Can you read a map?
- I'm an archaeologist.
I can even draw one.
All right. We're at the city limits,
at the southern edge of this oil field here.
Once you're over this hill there are
more oil wells, an abandoned refinery
and a harbor down to the southeast.
It's a kind of graveyard for old ships
that have become unseaworthy.
I used to play there as a kid. Anyway,
there's a derelict tanker at one end.
- You could hide there for a week.
- A week?
Until the commotion dies down a bit and
we can smuggle you back to the circus.
Then, as Armando says,
you can travel with them to Florida,
found your own colony in the Everglades
and live happily ever after.
It's time that you were moving on.
- Lewis.
- Yes?
If they find us... we shall be killed?
Ultimately.
Then...
give us the opportunity to kill ourselves
if that moment should come.
Please?
I shouldn't do this,
but I guessed you might ask.
You're the second human I've kissed.
And you are the first.
Come along, Zira! Now, don't dawdle.
- The ape with the kid?
- Heloise?
Oh, she's been with the circus
seven years now.
And the baby's birth
was registered 16 days ago.
Look how he's growing. The first
chimpanzee ever to be born in a circus!
Do you realize
what a distinction that is, huh?
It's like being the first fish
to be born on dry land.
Nothing.
Or the first bird to be born without an egg.
It is like being the first baby
to be born on the moon.
It's like being the...
- Negative!
- We'll catch "em sooner or later.
That's what I'm worried about - later.
Later we'll do something about pollution.
Later we'll tackle
the population explosion.
Later we'll do something
about the nuclear war.
We think we got all the time in the world.
How much time has the world got?
Somebody has to begin to care.
Oh! Like stars in space. Isn't it beautiful?
Yes, it is. From here.
We must move on.
Who found it?
The field superintendent
on a service check.
It was hidden here in the workings.
I guess she didn't need this any more.
So why don't we get moving?
It's a big area.
We've called for helicopters.
- How long will they be?
- 20 minutes.
- Why so long?
- They're running down a fire report.
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter?
- They found Zira's suitcase.
- Did Lewis really play here?
- Oh, it was probably cleaner then.
It stinks of man.
Oh, no, no. That's oil. And dead fish.
Is that what man wanted oil for?
To kill fish?
You don't like them very much, do you?
- Who?
- Humans.
We've met hundreds
since we've been here,
and I trust... three.
- He wants feeding.
- Yes, well...
Well, there must be someplace
cleaner than this.
I'll look around.
Cornelius?
I see you've had your baby, Zira.
The Presidential Commission has
empowered me to take it in my care.
Give it to me.
Cornelius!
Stevie.
Zira.
I want that baby.
If you won't give it to me, I'll shoot.
My God, stop him!
No!
Keep your men here! Come on!
What's she doing?
Oh, my God.
All hands on the guy lines.
Drop the bail ring!
All right, all extra hands in the back yards
to the quarter poles! On the double.
As soon as you get that canvas packed,
I want every hand in the menagerie tent.
Intelligent creature.
