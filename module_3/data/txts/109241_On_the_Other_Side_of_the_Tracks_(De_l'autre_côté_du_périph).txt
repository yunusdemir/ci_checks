Bobigny, suburb of Paris
Good evening. Welcome, Mr. Barberis.
Barberis. Got you, asshole.
Damn, what are they doing?
Good evening. Switch off the engine.
What are you doing? Get out!!
Shit!!! Asshole!
Shit!
Police officer in trouble!
Vehicle fleeing! CitroÅE ZX, red!
Pull over!
- We're colleagues.
We're colleagues, asshole!
Your hands! Easy!
- No moving, Easy!
I wanna see your hands!
Barberis, 2 years ago.
Barberis in front of a seedy gambling den
with us in Bobigny last night.
Everyone thinks he is in Chile,
but he's here.
This is the evidence.
- Sorry, Ousmane.
Doesn't matter.
So...
Where was I?
Barberis...
- yes.
Look, Barberis is there. With us.
Chief, that is Barberis.
I found him.
At Van Goghs gambling den
last night with us in Bobigny.
Enough. We have nothing.
Barberis has been running for 6 months.
And you see him everywhere.
You see him, yet he goes into hiding.
He mocks us, he has support...
from bigwigs. We know that.
Yes, but this involves commercial crime.
And I want arrests.
The Bank of Elysee should not collapse,
and don't break anything.
l don't care, I'm carrying on.
There were chicks staring at us
when we left.
Did you get her number?
What's your excuse this time?
You were sleeping, period. I saw it.
You should talk to her.
As I did with that chick.
The dwarf?
Come on, that's not fair.
hey, you're pissing on Mrs..
Shit!
Madam!
- What have you done?
Let's go find a cop.
I've pissed in my hand....
Samir!
Go away.
You're gonna expose me, everyone can see you're a cop.
It went wrong last night.
Give me the next place to meet.
Have you seen the way you look?
It screams cop from 100 meters.
Chill. Here you risk nothing.
No worries. I'm on my turf.
I blend in.
Straight, first left.
and then you're in the Daboukir street.
Cheers, friend.
Thank you, sir.
- Excuse me, officer.
Mr. cop,
we want to show you something.
What did you say?
- You're a cop aren't you?
You're wrong.
- You'll see.
I'm not a cop.
I'm just walking.
I'm in my neighborhood. I was born here.
You can see that you are a cop.
No, no, I'm not a cop.
No, not at all.
There is no shame.
Come, keep walking. There's no cop here.
'keep walking'...
- What?
That's typical for a cop.
I don't say that to a friend.
Sometimes I say 'keep walking' to a friend.
- No!
There's a dead body.
I pissed all over her. Come.
A dead body? What?
I was talking
to my friend and...
Did I mention that I am having lunch today
with the Captain?
If they look at my CV,
it's alright.
I dn't even have to take exams.
I've worked brilliantly for 10 years.
Captain Morland sees me performing.
I worked 7 years as commissioner,
then Superintendent.
And then department head.
I've sewn them all up.
Hello, Chief?
<i>- Monge?</i>
I was just thinking about you.
<i>That is very...</i>
- Shut up!
Sorry. Not you. I'm listening...
<i>- There was a body found in Bobigny.</i>
<i>The Office wishes Serious Crimes</i>
<i>there to investigate.</i>
<i>Lunch with the Captain is off.</i>
<i>He is in Dijon.</i>
In Dijon?
<i>- Yes. Are you okay?</i>
I will not hide my dissappointment... Hallo?
Laurence, I'm sorry.
Honey, I'm Really ....
Come on. I can be fast if I want to.
- You're a dick.
Quickly, I have to go to a body to Bobigny.
- Bobigny? Does it excite you?
Why?
- Are you sick?
I've always felt at ease
in the field.
That depends on the field.
Isn't that the usual story.
You sell yourself short.
Shit!
Take this, inspector.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Unbelieveable.
Monge and his new wagon on the way.
FranÁois Monge in the open air.
Lost a bet?
Very funny. Really.
Monge in Bobigny. That we must
immortalize. A photo, Please.
You have time for jokes.
Update me.
We have a victim.
Not from here.
- apparently.
She is wet. They wanted to burn her?
May I?
- Go ahead. I'm finished.
That's not gasoline.
What is it? I know the smell.
Kader pissed on her.
He found her this morning.
I said all civilians off site!
Luitenant Ousmane DiakhitÅE
Detective. I'm the cop who reported the murder.
Inspecteur FranÁois Monge,
Serious Crimes.
The prosecutor has transferred the case.
We're letting you go. Thanks.
We found this on the victim.
Eponine Chaligny? It can't be true!
Do you know her?
The wife of Jean-Eric Chaligny.
The Big Boss in the Employers' Union.
The boss of bosses. Do you do not watch TV?
He is everywhere with the strikes.
She's a customer in a gambling den where I did
2 months of investigations.
That's nice.
Really. Other bigwigs are customers.
- Yes...
Naturally.
- Apparently.
Nice theory. I admit it.
Thanks for the help.
Look.
Inspector FranÁois Monge,
Serious Crimes.
Can I speak to Mr. Chaligny?
- Chief...
Look. We have something.
For us, it's over.
They'll take over.
We're going back to the office.
No, I'm staying because ...
Monge inspector wants me to work
together with him.
Serious Crimes wants to work with you?
- Indeed.
Look, he thinks the two related cases
can be worked together.
And that we can work together.
I can help him.
Especially since he needs help
in the other case...
You just need to call the Attorney
General to confirm.
Monge!
- What?
Okay, I'll take care of it. But behave!
Police!
Is your scooter in order?
Follow that car!
Monge!
- Did you follow me? You're crazy.
You havn'tt seen my Photos.
- That does not interest me.
Wait, I need to show you something.
That guy, that's Van Gogh.
He organizes the illegal gambling.
- I really dn't care.
Every week he changes location.
And your girlfriend ...
Excuse me.
- She's here ... Wait.
Thank you, sir.
- Wait, wait.
Wait, look. Who is that?
Another thing ... Barberis also plays there.
Barberis, the fugitive?
- Yep.
What is he doing here?
Is he not in Chile?
What is it about Chile?
He is here, in Bobigny.
Chaligny, Barberis.
This could be interesting.
That's why we must work together.
- yes, no. Wait.
Listen carefully... Osama.
You must understand that I absolutely,
totally do not need you.
I do not interfere with your case
and you can not with mine.
You want to go solo? No problem.
Because I'm also sitting on a case
in which I must speak to Chaligny.
Shut up.
You're a good cop,
or you wouldn't have followed me.
You're the besy cop in the projects.
But this is Paris.
Worse, it's the 8th arrondissement.
The 'capital' of Paris.
So quiet, we're walking on eggshells.
And it looks like you do not know
where you put your feet.
I'm not retarded.
- I doubt it.
I'm a cop like you, man.
- I think not. And I'm not your man.
Where are you going?
Gentlemen, good day.
A Lackey. A Lackey!
Inspector FranÁois Monge,
I would like to speak to Mr. Chaligny.
He is have breakfast at salon Richelieu.
- Richelieu?
Damn, what class.
We always hang out in the Georges Moustaki.
I'll pass.
- Thank you.
What's this? Unbelievable parquet.
We're not in the circus, kid.
What do you care?
We are not partners. Or are we?
We play good cop, bad cop.
- No. I talk, you remain silent.
It's a pleasure, Daniel Cardinet.
- Hello.
Mr. Chaligny will see you.
You may also come.
Inspector Monge, Serious Crimes.
- Hello, Mr. Chaligny.
Lieutenant ...
- Ousmane DiakhitÅE
Good day, gentlemen.
Lovely place. Nicely decorated,
with taste and so...
Congratulate the Ambassador
for it is very successful.
Another wonderful reception.
Mr. Khadi... KhaditÅEis from Bobigny.
DiakhitÅE
- Can we talk to you separately?
You can speak freely. Daniel Cardinet
is our Secretary-General.
Sit down.
You can join us.
I bring you bad news.
I regret to inform you
that your wife is deceased...
Sorry. Will you wait a moment?
Hold on ...
Yes, Samir?
<i>There will be another game.</i>
- When?
<i>No idea. But there will be another.</i>
- I want the exact place.
<i>Don't know in advance.</i>
- Call me back with proper info.
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>
- Otherwise ...
Did you have to tell him?
What did he say?
Was he surprised?
- Yes.
Do you know that your wife did in Bobigny?
I do not know what she did there.
- I do, Mr. Chaligny.
Your wife was a loyal customer
of Van Gogh.
Van Gogh organises illegal gambling.
Your wife was a regular.
Is this a joke?
- What my colleague...
wants to say in a funny manner...
is that we may not exclude all possibilities.
In that environment, you'll be against
all sorts of people
You will find bigwigs, VIPs.
Important people, heavy ...
- Enough!
Do you know how she went there?
Eponine usually used
my driver, Giovanni.
Can we talk to him?
- He's sick. He did not come to work.
Would you be kind enough to
give me his address?
Of course, immediately.
Well done.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Condolences.
- Fine. Your hand was sure.
What were you doing?
Great.
We did it as we were supposed to
I was brutal, and you calmed him.
- I refuse to work with you.
You broke the agreement:
five interruptions.
You're hurting our investigation
and you make fun of me.
Yes.
<i>- Monge, its Morland.</i>
Hello, Captain.
<i>- You must work together on the Bobigny muder.</i>
Work together?
<i>- Yes, you are to share your information with...</i>
<i>Lieutenant Diak, Dia ... and something else.</i>
<i>It was such a good idea to work together.</i>
<i>Very good for your career.</i>
Yes, I'd love to work with him
I'm always in favor of such a synergy.
<i>Well done.</i>
- Have a nice day. Good Day..
You're a suck up!.
And now, partner?
57, avenue Mozart, in the 16th.
Do you knoiw where it is?
I have to share information,
not the car. Take boulevard Ousmane.
Like found.
I'll call the police ...
- I am the police!
Sir, don't you want to go away?
- Excuse me, ma'am. police.
We want to speak to Giovanni di Pietro.
Is he the police?
- It has been said.
Michel Sardou. For real?
- Apparently.
Hello, children.
- Hi, Mrs. Martin.
Even rich kids!
- clown!...
This is the underground of the 16th.
He's not there. We'll be back.
Thank you, ma'am.
- Do you have the keys?
That is illegal.
- Indeed.
Soon it will be the end of the year.
"Envelopes", gratuities...
That is illegal!
I think there is money
in being a caretaker.
Wait.
- It's nothing. Good Day, Mrs..
No, not necessarily. We are not allowed in.
If you find something,
it's inadmissible.
Do not be stupid.
What are you doing? Come here.
Come here. You know it is forbidden.
There should be at least 2 witnesses.
That is basic knowledge.
I wouldn't do anything.
I'm almost Captain.
Here are your two witnesses. Behind you.
Thick chests.
Look.
Evidence.
- Wait.
That's Nabil. What's he doing here?
Who is that?
That's him, Giovanni.
Giovanni is Nabil!
What, Giovanni is Nabil?
That is moronic.
Crazy!
He thought that Giovanni
is more impressive than Nabil.
And you know him well?
No, not really.
In the neighborhood where I grew up
I saw him occasionally.
I know where he is.
With his mother in Bobigny.
You know what that means?
Your glitzy comments and
sweet talk won't work here.
Here you have to earn respect,
but gently.
Here you are my trainee.
I have a thorough knowledge
of the suburb, man.
I studied in L'Isle-Adam.
What do you know
except what they say in books?
Burning cars, drugs, dealers?
That's not the real suburb.
What the real suburb has,
you will not find in the 8th:
Camaraderie, solidarity, warmth.
Yes, sir, I'm sure.
Do not move, bitch!
Give me your money. Move!
Get out of here, he's got a gun!
Camaraderie and ...
What was it? Warmth?
I did not hear the last word.
They are not from here.
What is it? Afraid that
a pigeon poops on your nice suit?
I saw a documentary ...
I read in a report...
that they sometimes throw down
washing machines.
There was a washing machine?
A certain brand?
You are here in my neighbourhood.
If you do what I say,
everything will be fine.
You shut up and I speak.
All Ok, men?
Gentlement.
The rent was paid by my son.
We are not bailiffs.
We have a few questions for you.
I don't know where Nabil is.
Mrs Beyoud,
it's Ousmane DiakhitÅE
The small Ousmane from building 7?
That's me.
- I can't believe it.
May we come in?
- Naturally.
Come on. No ...
the rules have remained the same.
Shoes off.
Damn.
You have to sit on it.
- Thank you.
Tea?
No, thank you.
- You're young, you have to eat.
You have to take it.
That's hospitality. The warmth.
Thank you, ma'am.
- So you're in the police.
You're no longer crying. You're a man now.
Did he cry a lot?
- All the time.
As a child, Nabil often teased him.
Ousmane cried.
- Oh really.
You exaggerate. I did not cry, we played.
No, he cried.
We heard him all the time.
Remember when Nabil pulled
off your pants ...
and you ran through the whole district in tears?
No!
- Yes!
The shame.
- No shame.
In underpants?
- Yes.
He crapped himself rotten in those underpants!
Do not confuse me with Samba?
He is in denial.
Yes, why do you deny it?
- We were talking about Nabil.
Do you know where we can find him?
- No idea.
Where can I wash my hands,
please?
That at the end of the corridor. There.
Take it easy.
You've grown up.
You're with the police. Well done.
We're so proud.
What are you doing?
Out of the way, Ms. Beyoud.
That's not good.
You arrest my son. Is that good?
- Stupid bitch!
I am friendly, I give you cookies.
- I'm a cop.
Get out of the way!
I got it!
I got it.
I got it...
Stop, Nabil. You'll only make it
worse.
he's mine...
he's mine...
- Monge.
What?
Help!
Help! Shut up, you!
Stop!
Damn Turkish delight!
She had it all, the witch!
It's over, Nabil.
Shut up.
- What are you doing here?
I know he was going to come this way.
As a child he did this also.
Why didn't you tell me?
- I did this...
-And what the hell does that mean?
-"Run" like that.
That is "building", that is "run".
No, that's "Get out of the way, out of the way".
- No, "Get out of the way" is this.
No, that's "go away"
and this is "run".
Whatever.
- You said "walk" damnit.
relax. It's a misunderstanding.
It's just that you looked so happy.
"He's mine! He's mine!"
I have left it for you.
I came to help you.
Why are you hiding?
Something on your slate?
- Fuck off.
I thought you guys were bailiffs.
I am called Giovanni.
your stuff.
Let him go immediately.
- Bitchers, let him go!
Pipe down. Serious Crimes, Paris.
Everything is under control.
Just walk by.
- Big mouth for a bitch with a badge.
Yes, a badge whore.
- Excuse me?
Serious Crimes.
You know what that means?
You come home earlier than expected.
- Whore!
Now you go too far, boy.
Papers...
Everyone remain chilled.
- I want his papers.
Leave him. It's over.
- Are you a bluebottle?
I'm like you, cousin. Come on.
- I'm not your cousin.
Bitch!
Looserman was his nickname
because he was always a loser.
He got his ass kicked by us.
Looserman, Looserman...
The stunner of the district?
The kaid of Bobigny?
It's Looserman. Who
am I here with? with Looserman.
Wait, do I have more chance
with or without you?
What do you think, with your Serious Crimes?
You sign autographs?
Because of you was it a fiasco.
- Because of me?
They insult us
and what is your solution?
"Shut up, lower your eyes ..."
I'm not a parking-meter cop.
Looserman... unbelieveable.
- Looserman.
Shut up, you.
- All good.
Shut up!
Answer the questions I do not
want to ask, then we win time.
You're the last person that saw
your boss alive.
Who are you playing with? Barberis?
first answer
the question that I don't ask.
Yes, the case with the gypsies, I was
that way he can not say anything.
Seriously, take some paper and go
do some origami.
No, the paperwork , that's
your speciality.
Murder? I did not kill anyone.
She asked me if I knew a place
to gamble.
And Van Gogh
wanted me to find customers.
So I did that.
- I've seen your file.
There are virgin criminal records,
but yours is quite raped.
Good one, hey.
What he means by his shit joke,
is that you're in shit. Talk.
I did not kill anyone.
We are family.
I've beaten, but loving.
- &9a#jj.
Stop that family stuff.
I have no time to lose.
You're the only suspect, no alibi,
jail, period.
Let me explain. That's a minimum.
I don't care about your bullshit.
I have not eaten.
I'm locking you up. Strip search him.
Is that OK? You don't mind?
Well, wait, wait...
She had an appointment at the gambling den.
I waited, went to look for her
and found her between the dirt bags.
That of the gypsies.
- You could call police.
I do not have the identity of a witness.
It's a cow, but not a murderer.
A cow, yes, but not a killer.
I swear.
We now go to the gypsies.
- Beef yes, no killer.
everything okay?
I have information for you. look.
Look at it, we'll talk about it later.
- Thanks, Yasmine.
Yasmine... The charm of the East.
Can I go?
- Of course, you can go to your cell.
Guys, I'm claustrophobic.
Marrakech!
The Koutoubia, the Jemaa el-Fna Square...
I remember the children
playing with herbs...
in the gardens of La Mamounia...
What I like to do when I get there...
is a bowl of hot drink harira.
With my pashmina in
Snow of the Atlas.
You were right.
- I told you.
She was not the by accident,
she was not allowed in the casino.
We need to do raids by the Gypsies.
I want this finished today.
Not today.
I have spoken to my informant, Samir.
Van Gogh's throwing a party tomorrow.
I'll get the van ready.
Tomorrow we tackle Barberis.
- I won't be here any day longer.
I'm going to the gypsies.
- No, we've worked here for 6 months.
You're not going to ruin everything.
- All right, all right.
He's crazy ...
- Quiet. But he's right.
think.
Listen, soon you'll have
a murder solved...
a fugitive caught
and a network crushed.
Do you realize that? Your bosses
are going to fall off their chairs.
All thanks to you. FranÁois Monge.
You're a killer, man.
I'm not your man
- That means yes.
Welcome to the team.
Yves!
Yves!
At the table. We need to talk
about your principal. She calls me constantly.
I dream at night that
she's stalking me. She is crazy.
At the table, I said!
You do not close one in the
toilets of the school for two hours.
That you do not do.
I'm sure he's stolen the compass.
I took him into custody
until he could talk.
Stop it because you make
me nervous. enough.
I'm talking to you. stop it!
But they're cops.
- Well and?
Do you think we all
just shoot?
I have a headache.
I have hot dogs.
Men.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Congratulations Morland. Tomorrow
a raid at the gypsies. Case solved.
According to witnesses, I can find
Barberis...
Not bad for an office guy, huh?
Sorry, not just the head works...
That is if it is connected?
He uses it as a stepping stone.
Is not going to happen.
- Wait.
Sorry...
- No problem.
Such a pretty face
nothing should happen.
Strong. She is sure.
Same, please.
<i>The unions are calling</i>
<i>new action on Thursday.</i>
<i>Setback for Chaligny, the Chairman</i>
<i>of the Employers' Organization...</i>
<i>whose wife died yesterday</i>
<i>whose body was found in Bobigny.</i>
<i>She was killed</i>
<i>in tragic circumstances.</i>
<i>a new meeting</i>

<i>is proceeding tomorrow...</i>
Shit.
Did you get lots of sleep?
- It was a tough night.
I could not sleep.
I woke up after a nightmare.
Tell me your life as if we are friends.
What is it?
I'm afraid that someone throws
down a bust of Rodin.
Sometimes they throw pianos.
My God!
A very beautiful woman, hey?
A very beautiful woman...
- So...
a hit in the neck.
The killer used
a blunt object.
According to you?
Car Jack, crowbar?
A polostick or a  golfclub.
- Possible.
What are you doing?
Exactly what I thought.
They are fake!
That has nothing to do with the case.
That's what you think. In medicine
details are important.
What was eaten, you will not like ...
- No, show me.
That is called the bolus.
Is that caviar?
I'm hungry.
Thanks, kid!
Axel Foley in Beverly Hills
makes an impression.
Joss Beaumont...
that's not name for a cop!
That's a name for a minister
from the French Foreign Office.
Joss stands for Josselin.
- Josselin is even worse.
'The  Professional' is the standard
for all French cops.
Not for all. No, no.
Axel Foley, that's an example of someone
who asserts himslef with his smooth tongue.
Pure class!
- Joss Beaumont has two women.
So?
- And they know each other!
Is that "class"?
Do you respect that?
What?
- You are crazy.
He's useless, no ethics ...
- That's an era.
It's not polygamy or honorable.
Are you going to lecture me?
- Yes.
What do you mean?
It means you're full of shit.
Well I already have my vaccines.
This is Mr. de Hertog.
The future Supervisor Commissioner.
A Parisian...
If that means eating somewhere
without getting tetanus, yes.
It means that you think
that the suburbs are the Third World.
I come from Auteuil. That was a folk village
in the Middle Ages with farmers.
He gets the deluxe version.
- Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.
Do not apologize.
Go to school here?
the state spends more
on Parisian parks than Parisian parks.
Finished your sermon? Okay,
you live tiny, but modern.
Destroyed, but by whom?
My mother does not spray graffiti.
We may also complain.
Do you know how much rent I pay
80 m≤ in Paris?
A minimum wage?
How much is that?
- 1200 euro.
Escatly man. 1200 euro.
Disgusting!
- Indeed!
I was also in trouble
if I did not have my parents' apartment.
For you.
The Georges Moustaki youth.
Good for the conscience of the state.
So it was the same when I was a kid.
And it will be the same if you have kids.
So don't.
Yes.
Ok Ok.
Problems?
That was the neighbor.
Yves hangs around with the youth.
I knew it. I can handle him.
Who is Yves?
- My son.
You have a son who is called Yves?
So had my father.
Come ride.
- That's why I do not use a light.
Yes, I'm in a hurry.
Where is his mother?
She is gone.
Where?
She's gone!
Okay, she's gone.
You said 'she's gone'. That's not clear.
She left you.
Excuse me ... To wash hands ...
Where is the toilet?
<i>The return of Francis I, King of</i>
<i>surveillance. Give'm the bottle.</i>
Do not be ashamed of us,
We are used to it.
You go first, because I'll spill.
Yves, what was with that dealer?
I was undercover.
<i>There are dealers who distribute drugs</i>
<i>in the neighbourhood. I'm going to close the network.</i>
Give me their number,
I'll teach them morals.
Will it take long?
My battery is running low.
Still nice that your father
has work?
I liked it.
- Your father as a beggar on a bench?
Yves, another act please.
My father was the Prefect of NiËvre.
Be nice to your dad.
He had a tough childhood.
I hear everything!
Barberis is not coming.
He's fucking Chilean girls...
...dancing with Chilean girls.
Go inside and finsh.
We follow the plan.
You always sit in the office...
<i>So you know what surveillance is.</i>
- I was the best student!
You as a hobo won't
teach me.
Guys, there's a car.
Damn.
Ousmane, it does not look good.
Good evening, department of the homeless.
<i>Department of Homeless.</i>
We'll take you. There are still places.
I sleep here. Leave me alone.
<i>If you lived so long on the streets...</i>
Your response is normal.
- Yes, normal.
You bother me, sister.
I lie well here.
We're busted.
- I'm not going to sleep with them?
You go to bed with a full stomach.
Are you going to eat soup in Val Soleil.
Come on.
- All good!
<i>Bravo, good policework!</i>
And you think you're a cop?
<i>you're a civil servant!</i>
The 40 years has not been outside.
<i>A cunt licker, a pencil pusher,</i>
<i>a milksop...</i>
Rich boy!
- I'm fed up here.
Rich boy!
I am a police officer.
Let me go, okay?
Leave me.
- You still get cold.
We are here to help you.
- Shit!
Serious Crimes, Paris.
Where is your boss?
You look less stupid
than you look.
Though some have a lot of talent.
Congratulations, Mr.
You have a strange head.
You look like a snitch.
Attention, men.
Calm down. If you were a snitch,
I would know.
I will not betray you. Think.
Is it nice there?
I've seen we do not have the
same sense of humor.
Look.
Vincent Van Gogh.
At his best.
You want to hit me in my face.
Yep, you really want to hit me in the face.
You want to headbutt me?
What are you waiting for?
Jesus!
Police!
Shit, police!
Ousmane, we are here!
Bravo, you've ruined everything!
shut the fuck up!
Look what you've done!
down!
Are you crazy? What the fuck you doing?
Hold it, Van Gogh!
Cover me.
Serious Crimes! hands up!
Do not move!
Why am I going up?
No, but...
I'm going down. Shit!
Stop him.
He is front of me!
This can not be true!
Shit!
This is not true. Down, now!
Hold him tight!
Police! hands up!
Good! Now you are not so tough, huh?
Jesus.
There, I got them for you ...
They are yours.
Do not move.
We keep it simple.
Eponine Chaligny gambled here.
You finished her off.
You threw her body
in the dirt. I have proof.
You do not.
- Oh, no?
I have an eyewitness.
I have DNA,
I've got red hair, boy.
You bluff like an amatuer.
A beginner, me?
- Watch.
You're nervous.
You blink your eyes.
You and Giovanni had her
murdered. And I do not blink.
She always paid. That evening
she had to pay 100,000 euros.
You don't kill good customers.
You build a customer base.
- She came alone?
One evening she came with a man.
With suit and tie.
Like him?
- That's not him.
And him?
- Maybe...
They all look alike.
- He turns around.
Did he also gamble?
- No, he did not want to.
They quarreled.
- About?
He did not want to pick up
the children from the creche.
I blink!
And he talks about bluffing!
He keeps me fooled
and let's nothing go.
Bravo, you made me miss Barberis.
But we Cardinet.
That's a bigwig size XL.
Not all bigwigs do
shady business.
He said yes
on a picture of Chirac.
Not a good example.
- I'll set my pv tonight.
Tomorrow I arrest Chaligny
and Cardinet.
Who?
- Chaligny and Cardinet.
Arrest them, right.
Your son has been locked
in the van.
He patrols the Gypsies.
When do you report?
- Tonight.
I will make it for you?
Lethal Weapon 1, 2, 3, 4. OK.
Midnight Run.
48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop,
no classics...
Here.
Thank you.
Ok. Crazy!
Axel Foley wants to be Superintendent.
Very good, man.
Just like you ?
No, I'm stupid.
You'll do everything for an promotion, hey?
With my cat
and a father who is not a diplomat...
Do your exams like the rest.
Come, it is good ...
- What?
stay seated.
I can still watch.
No, it's my report. You can look later.
You are violentl. At school, you were so...
Take it off, and I accept it.
How do you keep your gun fixed?
What are you doing? Why?
This is how it is in movies.
You're a cop.
So, okay? At eye level.
Where are we?
- I have my men ready.
There and there.
- Why is your colleague alone?
Why is he alone?
You never leave a colleague uncovered! never!
Okay? You cover him...
and you iwe*&r  iwoeqj na%^$.
See how I kill him!
Motherfucker, look.
I fuck him!
Almost ready?
- To bed.
Never leave your colleague alone, okay?
- Okay.
Sleep well.
Sleep well, Commissioner.
Again.
- Sleep well, Commissioner.
Good. Ciao!
You're crazy to call.
Why are you so strict
when it comes to your son?
Do not play the unyielding father.
You look like mine did.
Allow me, please.
You do not know a child's hard upbringing here.
- Relocate.
You're lucky with such a child.
Do not be hard. Otherwise you grow apart
and then it's too late.
Okay, I have no child,
but a father.
You're crazy.
Do you have a file 'bigwigs'?
Where?
No. Where did you see that?
You hit it right off.
- Not at all.
Where?
How are things?
'Inspector Monge...' is what I am.
Completely beside himself...
and without procedural rules...
went inside without basic care,
"Motherfucker!
For example, it was still?
No, it was not like that.
Gerard and Yasmine will confirm it.
I have shown
initiative and courage...
to arrest a suspect.
I will change it.
- Please.
Wait...
'Inspector Monge...
With courage ... "That good?
- That's it.
"Did that way research
fail...
already six months was underway.'
That will look good in your file.
What do you want?
Nothing.
Something in?
- Exactly. That's it.
Something in.
Sir, what are you doing? It is forbidden.
I'm from the house.
- We all are.
Really.
- What is going on here?
You do not believe me?
- He says he 's from the house.
Hello, sir.
- Hi, Mrs..
May I see your card?
- No problem.
Unbelievable.
A large family, I thought.
Please.
- What is that?
Shows. "Bobigny Fried Chicken'.
Very funny. Get him out.
- Map of the library.
Get him out!
- With pictures. Of the library.
Quiet! No contact! wait!
What is that noise?
Wait! No!
- I don't know.
Do not touch.
- Quiet.
Why a headlock?
 I'm being molested.
Is this good?
Is this good?
- Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Okay, thank you.
Are you finished?
You must not mind him.
I thought we were a family.
My France hurts.
Where's the France
of Diderot, Voltaire?
France 1998. Lilian Thuram.
That you have forgotten.
Black, white, North African.
Zinedine Zidane.
Unbelievable.
- Shut up.
She looked at me as a courier.
And I have no helmet.
Is this Serious Crimes service ?
It's in a state of decomposition.
It's like us.
- But it's the 36th.
It's historic. Stupid, but true.
We have your viewed girlfriend's
accounts .
She had no right to an account.
Look.
One year without payment.
She gambled every day. There are witnesses.
100,000 cash.
Where did that come from?
We have to do a search
at Chaligny.
We enter quietly.
- You're the Attorney.
We are not cowboys.
Why not?
- You must be lieutenant DiakhatÅE
Diakhite.
Greetings, Captain Morland.
Strange to see you.
He often talks about you.
Is the case closed?
Do the Gypsies know?
Yes.
- No.
No.
No.
Unknown,
but we know that it's his.
We're going to determine that they 't be.
No, but he had the idea
to visit Mr. Chaligny.
To leak information on our investigation.
- No.
Really? That's nice. Good initiative.
But you better hurry up.
Above, they want to see results.
The spotlight is on you.
I told you, you're my star.
He's the best, he will solve it.
Isn't that right FranÁois?
Of course he is going to find it.
You're the best.
or not?
Let Mr. Chairman through
please.
I'm not the chairman.
No, not at all.
Not today. Hold on.
Hello, madam. FranÁois Monge,
Serious Crimes.
We would like to speak to Mr. Chaligny
and Cardinet.
Insofar as their schedule permits.
I'm sorry, they are
in a crisis meeting.
They've been stuck since this morning.
It could take a long time. It's hell...
Yes, it's probably not fun.
Thanks anyway.
Would you tell him that we were here?
Yes, of course.
- Thank you.
Good bye.
This is normal. They have
responsibilities. There is a crisis.
Cardinet! Chaligny!
Gentlemen, you can not. Please!
Gentlemen, come right back.
You can not go up.
What are you doing? Shit!
- Stop, please.
We would do so quietly.
- Mr. ??Chaligny is not available.
We rely on you...
Hello, are we disturbing you?
We have a few questions for you.
Inspector Monge, I'm sorry...
but can you come back later?
- Of course. Sorry
Did you hear that?
- You torture me.
Not at all.
- Liar.
I won't allow that.
- Again.
You torture me.
You said "you".
And it was not the first time.
What a spectacle.
- I did not remember.
Bigwigs coincide.
We are in the mothership
of the bigwigs.
Bosses over the world ...
puppet players.
Look, we have different
shades of gray.
From dark to bright.
Like a rainbow, but gray.
Dark, very bright,
dark, very bright...
Well done. You're an artist.
- I'll kill you.
Can I? a Mistake.
Sir, this is not your home.
You are the brightest.
Normally that is there.
You're the outsider of the gang.
the madness.
We expect comedians
the quai des OrfËvres?
I'm sorry, he's not
the Quai des OrfËvres.
Look, just black and white.
- You wanted to see me.
If your diary permits, that would...
Does France need a new comic duo
for a general strike?
But you have something important to ask me?
Well... sir...
DiakhatÅEand I heard a testimony
showing...
He's gross...
- You should take it with a grain of salt...
I will use the subjunctive...
Your wife, so Mrs....
Mrs. Chaligny obviously blessed it ...
because it involves her...
saw someone...
no psychiatrist.
She was with someone...
Mr. Cardinet, present here.
That question you wanted to ask me
in front of my employees?
I asked Mr. Cardinet to go with
my wife, to watch her.
I knew her addiction
brought her to the slums.
I could not go that night.
I had a union meeting
with Gilles Lagache.
If I had known...
I wouldn't have let her go alone
with ??Giovanni .
Was that your question?
- Yes, sir.
And what is the origin of the money
that your wife lost?
No idea. She had her own money.
- Mistake.
She had no right to a private account
and you knew that.
Whether you gave her money, or she stole it.
Unless they sold the lily-of-the-valley.
- Enough!
Fuck! You're beginning to annoy me.
I see that question angers you.
Sorry, Lieutenant DiakhatÅEis not
his usual self.
His wife is gone.
- Come on, get out!
I will not forget this.
This is not good for your rank.
Why should I? He ...
- Call the superintendent
Get out!
Why did you ... Why did you do that?
What have I done?
What?
- Why do you destroy my life?
He called the superintendent
- Chaligny freaked out because of the money.
Something's going on. That is evident. What do we do?
- No idea.
Think. I call the vice-superintendent.
I know him! We squash together.
Go ahead. I'm going to do my job
and continue our investigation.
To begin the study
to the agenda of Mr. Cardinet.
Did you see that meegepikt? You're crazy!
Want to help kill my career?
- Stand still, otherwise we fall.
Maybe they are watching
- No.
Give it back to the receptionist.
- Quiet.
Wait a minute ...
The night of the murder: Gilles Lagache.
Of course.
Tonight, 23 pm: La Aviary.
What is that?
Do you know that or not?
- Vague. We need reinforcements.
All the time they spend
in hamams...
Shaving is allowed, right?
Young African women...
If you look under such a burqa,
you would be amazed.
You're crazy!
Ever thought about therapy?
You should know,
I've known an Oriental Princess.
A cousin by marriage behind
King Hassan II.
a Devilish beauty, enchanting.
An angel face ... Cats Eyes ...
a Real slut...
a Real slut completely shaved!
Smooth, soft like a small apricot.
I wanted to be very small
to dive into it.
You're crazy! Really sick.
You've got a problem.
Your colleague Yasmine ...
how could she shave?
Why? They don't shave
- No?
Why should I go into that?
Just saying. We know nothing.
On the other hand I have nothing
against a full triangle.
My uniform is in order?
It's perfect.
- Are we going?
She's wearing a uniform.
What is this a place? a Sex Club?
Do not be vulgar.
It's a somewhat free club.
Free, forget it!
Hello FranÁois. Everything okay?
- Hi. How you doin '?
And how's work?
- Busy, busy, busy.
Yes?
- I don't sit still.
I'm married. To my Prince Charming.
He sits there with the red light ...
- I understand.
Bye.
Congratulations. My best wishes.
See you later. Ciao.
- Yes. Ciao.
I don't know who that is.
That's Cardinet.
Good evening, Marie-Jeanne.
Everything okay?
- All okay.
Hi, how you doin '?
It's okay, it's okay.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
Pleasant evening.
- Thank you.
Good night, all ok?
- Good evening.
We trekken ons uniform aan.
- Hoe bedoel je?
Do not go in like that.
Put on something loose.
What do you mean by "loose"?
- Like that man.
That is not loose, that is naked.
- Yeah, but he's relaxed.
We're not going there.
Yasmine, you're not.
We're watching someone, right?
Yes, and Cardinet doesn't know her.
Let her go alone.
Come on, relax.
What is it? Are you sick?
- No, I'm relaxed.
You wouldn't say so.
Hello boy.
- This isn't true.
How you doin '? Unbelievable.
It's been a long time.
This is Vivien, my tennis partner.
- Hello.
What is it? Do you have something against tennis?
- Not at all.
I'm gonna get you!
- Has your right arm improved?
My right, my backhand.
You'll see it. I'll get you. Watch out!
I'll get you whenever you want.
See you. Great guy..
Cardinet. He is by Lagache.
- Shit.
I thought that was outstanding. No bosses
it clearly depends on the context.
As agreed.
See you later.
- They're coming!.
Your hand!
Hello.
It's all right, damn it.
- That's enough.
Do not touch me. I felt your thing.
You were excited.
What? Me excited?
Are you crazy?
You stuck to me.
You breathed heavily.
Yes, I breathe.
- You're like children.
We must tackle the bag.
I'm going after Cardinet. You, Lagache.
- Forget it. Stay here.
It's not over. Get the bag.
You go get him.
- No, you're naked.
You're in the financial service.
I have principles. Don't you understand?
No. You play tennis naked,
but naked in the dark, does it work?
Who says I play naked tennis?
- I saw you with Vivien.
You saw me ... When?
All that bullshit before.
I heard everything. Disgusting.
You see filth everywhere.
- I see your ass anywhere.
Then don't look.
- I can't miss!
No, but ... You!
Your debauchery is contagious.
You're evil.
You're evil, this is your home.
Go away, I don't want to be infected.
Idiot!
- Who is that guy?
Evangelist! Black Mormon.
Still. I began to worry.
I do not know how you did it
but bravo.
Are we going?
- Wait ...
We're going to pick up the bag.
- There is no hurry.
We talk further. Okay?
Where is Ousmane?
- The bastard!
The asshole.
The motherfucker...
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?
- I followed Cardinet.
He brought a few things.
We have everything. Listen.
No. You're dragging me into your trap.
We're going.
I have a book with numbers and codes.
Financial transactions.
The Employers  are buying
social peace with money.
I don't care.
- There's a black book.
There's a black book.
That is the black book.
Give me that.
Hold on.
Bastard.
No problem. Police. A trade unionist
tried to penetrate.
No, not union.
No papers, no sleep.
No papers.
Handcuffs hurt, huh?
- Yes. That's not nice.
That hurts.
- Do not hit. That hurts.
Stop sir, that hurts.
Not sweet.
I have done nothing. Stop, man.
If you did nothing, I would not do anything.
- Are you crazy? Stop.
Pain. Not sweet.
- Ah, you speak French.
Damn it, man. Stop.
Congratulations.
The comedy duo
does it extremely well.
Now you're in trouble.
You're in trouble. We have everything!
You booklet, the bag you gave Lagache.
The black list. We know everything.
You will have to give an explanation.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I see two policemen
who commit theft by forcible entry.
All filmed by security cameras.
I fear you have
a thing to explain.
You will have a lot of free time.
Actually, sir, you were very
cute earlier.
When you caressed your boyfriend.
It Creates a bond
if you work in the city.
Max, join our friends.
Now cut me loose.
I don't think so.
You have committed a criminal offense.
Three days ago I was future
Commissioner, now Im' gonna write traffic fines.
We bring the truth to light.
Chaligny will hang, together with the bigwigs.
We've done nothing. Since I've known you,
I just do stupid things.
Your little book is not admissible.
Not with our burglary.
You're not a fucking cop
They will congratulate you.
Trust me again.
Don't you get it?
I don't want ever to see you again.
Before I met you, my life was
amazing.
No papers, no sleep.
- No paper.
What inspires you, Monge? The Superintendent
wants your immediate suspension.
I had to convince Chaligny
not to file a complaint.
I'm not worried,
but you have to help me.
What is it?
Do you not care about your career anymore?
yes.
I really like you, you know that.
Think about your future.
You did not want to go there, huh?
Bobigny Bobigny needs to keep her
men in a harness. That's it.
The 36th is not involved in
this case.
Boss.
- The minister called me.
Before ... personally.
It's my first minister in 20 years of service.
What have you done?
We have them. I have proof.
Okay, there's a small procedure mistake ...
But it was worth it. Everything is ready.
It's okay.
I couldn't do anything, Ousmane.
Some things are too big
for an ordinary cop.
Patrick, Lionel and I are going
for drinks. Are you coming?
No, thank you.
Damn. I'm going anyway.
<i> Yesterday there were real </ i>
<i> advances. </ i>
<i> Tangible, concrete advances ... </ i>
<i> But not enough ... </ i>
What? He was in it!
He called, and wondered
what was going on.
He has lost the plot.
- Completely.
<i> I told you I always </ i>
<i> would stand. behind you </ i>
Shouldn't you go to school?
- No, they're on strike.
And you?
-. I'm also on strike
What's that?
- Don't you know that?
A classic.
That is Belmondo, 'Le Professionnel'.
It's not Eddy Murphy,
but it's not bad.
I almost had them.
- What happened?
I knew too much. I was too dangerous
for the bigwigs.
I was let down.
- FranÁois?
In Paris they do not have the same culture.
He can not leave his colleague alone.
- FranÁois ...
was the first to let me down.
Tell me.
First, we found a dead woman
that smelled like urine ...
That was all for nothing. Case closed.
That's it? What a stupid ending.
- That's it.
You could damage him.
This can not be.
Mother Beyoud is all bling.
No! In front. What is that?
A driver with Edouard Leclerc.
That's the pinnacle.
Come.
What are you doing here?
- Papa goes back to the district. You coming?
What is all this?
Never leave your colleague alone.
Was that nonsense?
What are you doing here, Looserman?
Do you trust again?
- Where's your slutty friend?
He hides like a hooker.
You do not understand. I'm at home here.
I'm not a cop. I'm on vacation.
That is good news.
 We're free to lash.
Like a good hooker that you will remember
from your youth. Damn...
Whore.
- Looserman!
I'm tired of that stuff.
It's enough.
Serious crimes, Paris. I'm back
because I have not penetrated.
Turn around.
What are you doing here?
 - You OK?
Sending detectives to see
if I still have my service weapon?
Hold on, your son came along.
He told me about Giovanni.
He has a calling.
Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm Ok.
I have to go.
The Van Gogh family wants me dead.
Guys, do something.
Ousmane, Ousmane, FranÁois...
You think we're crazy.
- No.
Tell her to keep her mouth shut.
They'll take you!
- Are we friends or not?
There's something about Yasmine
that bothers me.
That one night ... well, we had
to follow someone ...
but some gestures or looks
don't fool.
You're the expert, so I was wondering
whether she is  a super cop or...
She is a super cop.
Honest, professional ...
- Very careful.
Move.
- It stinks of piss. I'm not getting out.
What's the plan?
- What time is it?
Quarter to. They're coming.
- I think.
On the whole, they are punctual ...
- Especially if they want their money back.
Who?
- The gypsies. They are very punctual.
Who? The gypsies?
No, not the gypsies.
You can not hide
behind mama.
What madness is this? I'm a
victim. I have not done anything.
Nothing taken? Just tell them
that you do not have the money.
Tell your mom shopping at Leclerc.
With a chauffeur.
We should leave the mothers out of this.
Are you cops or not?
I am not. I was thrown out.
- And my working hours are shortened.
Wait. I know that the money
came from the Employers union.
Chaligny's wife picked up the cash
to finance the gambling.
And because of Cardinet and Mrs.
Chaligny, I do not need to explain...
Where's the money?
You've kept it, for safety?
When I dropped her off that night,
I was left alone with the briefcase.
I could not leave it there.
The neighborhood has a bad name.
Indeed.
- I did not kill her, really.
You understand that I do not want to die.
Chaligny allowed his wife to be killed.
- It would appear so.
You're going to help us.
<i>If it fails, you say 'carpet'.</i>
<i>- 'Carpet'? Very funny.</i>
<i>That should be on the ground,</i>
<i>I'm getting my shoes dirty.</i>
<i>How do I put 'carpet' into a sentence</i>
- Figure it out! It will not change.
He goes to Mr. Chaligny's car.
Hello, Daniel.
Are these our new offices?
Yes, there's even a gym and a spa.
- A spa?
Where were you? On vacation?
What do you want from Mr. Chaligny?
The thing is, I know everything.
I know everything about everything. Where the money
came from, the slush fund...
My mother always used to say
I had to keep my mouth shut.
'It's true, I talk too much.
I tell people secrets.
Crazy, huh? Where is Mr. Chaligny?
He's waiting in the car.
Mr. Chaligny...
What's that?
So you know everything?
- Wait, I know nothing.
I know things, but
which are unimportant.
You steal our money and want more.
Are you going to threaten me?
Eponine wanted to tell everything to
Chaligny, the press and even the taxman.
Chaligny did not kill his wife.
- Are you laying carpet in your spa?
<i>Because of you, she asked me for more money.</i>
<i>It's because of you.</i>
It would not have happened
if you had not spoken with Van Gogh.
Tell me everything. I know nothing.
I want it to remain so. Carpet.
Do not listen to me.
I talk crap.
I did not know you were the culprit. Carpet!
- Yes, you do.
Get in.
I know what you're thinking,
but sometimes don't do anything.
Wait.
My mother said a lot of good...
Forward. He will shoot. Fast.
Daniel, please.
What's this? You work for them?
Crafty fox!
I needed them.
Guys, he had her killed.
Carpet.
Carpet.
Police!
Quiet. It'll be all right.
Death to the employers' organizations!
Are you OK?
- It'll be all right...
It'll be all right. It's not bad.
It'll be all right.
Are we in Paris or in the suburb?
Paris or the suburb?
We are in the suburb, man.
I can go peacefully.
Stop that nonsense.
Out of the way. Ousmane, got it?
Congratulations. Yesterday it all
suddenly changed.
The prosecutor is satisfied. He has
seen the investigating judge.
It was just a crime of passion.
Caused waves
in the highest circles.
The Superintendent has changed his agenda
to have dinner with you tonight.
I have been asked to take back
a document...
that you have of Mr. Cardinet,
which would be
a document ... a notebook?
With details of a slush fund which proves
that the employers' organization?
Which proved that it could bribe
or buy other unions like Mr. Lagache's.
We operate in a very
difficult social environment.
The strike is over. The French
can spare such a scandal. Where is it?
Given to the investigating judge only.
Should it not have been given?
Yes, if you don't want a career.
You know what to do.
It's not admissible evidence.
You have nothing.
It proves that DiakhatÅEwas right.
Many bigwigs are involved.
Madness, even if she died in Montaigne avenue,
we wouldn't have known.
Social peace has a price.
- That only bigwigs pay.
Can you ask the Superintendent to excuse me. I have to study.
And soon, because I hear that
the exams are getting more difficult.
See you soon.
Mr. Francois, your luxury roll.
Thank you, Rita.
- You're welcome.
It's greasy, but tasty.
Goodbye, Rita.
- Thank you.
A real patron, Giovanni.
The Georges Moustaki youth centre.
You see, bigwigs do
invest in the suburb.
I have something for you.
New information about Barberis.
- Come on!!
It was easy. You were right.
He's in France.
And he knows them all.
- who?
Bigwigs.
- unbelievable.
But one thing you don't know.
He is not in Bobigny, but in Chatou.
In Cuntville?
- Chatou! Idiot.
But I heard ...
- You're a pervert.
But I always think
that you are going to say something.
You only think
about sex, idiot.
And, where did they transfer you to?
- You'll never guess.
To Paris.
- The bastards!
