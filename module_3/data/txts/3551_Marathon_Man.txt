We haven't done anything

I'm far too sensitive
for this kind of work.
Something for your crash diet,
LeClerc. The least I could do.
<i>Merci</i>, Scylla.
My diet is going badly.
I'm beginning to think I lack willpower.
Why were you surprised to see me?
I wasn't.
You were when I came in.
Did you think I was dead?
(SCOFFS) That's ridiculous. I expected
you three days ago, that's all.
London got busy.
I'm over here to do a lot of things.
You're only one of them.
Mmm.
I haven't got anything for you here.
- Why not?
- Well...
I couldn't keep it in the shop.
Look. I'll have it for you tonight.
You'll have to come to the opera.
The opera!
It's worse than that.
It's a very long French opera.
You'll have it tonight, won't you?

Mike, who you have for

- Which room is Biesenthal's?
- 107.
You were picked for his seminar?
You weren't?
Ah, Levy. Good of you to come.
Won't you join us?
Tell us the subject of
your dissertation, please?
Tyranny, sir.
The use of tyranny in
American political life.
Such as?
Maybe...
Coolidge breaking up
the Boston police strike,
Roosevelt putting Japanese-Americans
into concentration camps...
You might consider the
McCarthy business?
- Sir?
- McCarthy.
Senator from Wisconsin? Ran a
series of purges in the '50s?
Yes, I'm aware of that, sir.
I was planning a chapter on him.
A chapter, I see. Yes, interesting.
Well, you four have
the dubious honour
of having been picked from over
200 applicants for this seminar.
There's a shortage of natural resources,
breathable air and adequate claret,
but there's no
shortage of historians.
We grind you out like link sausages.
It's called progress.
Manufactured doctorates
is called progress.
I say, "Let us hush this cry of progress
till 10,000 years have passed."
That's a quote. Who said that?
Come on. Who said that?
Well, somebody must know the answer!
Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson.
You can't compete on a doctoral level
and not know <i>Locksley Hall.</i>
I hope you all flunk! Dismissed.
- Levy?
- Yeah.
Come.
Oh. Sit.
I knew your father.
Rather well, in point of fact.
He was my mentor.
I know.
- There was another of you.
- I have an older brother.
A rich, successful businessman.
My father would have disowned him.
Why are you at Columbia
for your doctorate?
It's not just the way things worked out.
Your father got his at Columbia.
You can't fill his footsteps,
I'm sorry to say.
You might end up leaving
larger tracks than that,
but they'll be your tracks,
they won't be his.
Why didn't you answer
that Tennyson question?
It was obvious you knew.
I don't know.
How am I to fathom your mind if
you continue to hide it from me?
If you persist,
I'll conclude you're a drone.
The McCarthy section is central
to your dissertation, yes?
The McCarthy section is
central to your dissertation, yes?
Yes.
Very worrisome.
You wish to write about a period in
our history that destroyed your father.
But we're talking about an
objective doctoral thesis.
It mustn't become a hysterical crusade.
That's not the way to clear him.
<i>All right, you may go.</i>
I don't have to worry about clearing
him, because he was innocent.
(GUN FIRES)
Don't you think he was innocent, sir?
No, I think he was guilty.
<i>He was guilty of being arrogant
and brilliant and of being naive.</i>
<i>Of not being able to cope with the
humiliation of being dismissed.</i>
But of the charges,
I know he was innocent.
And if it matters, Levy,
I wept the day he died.
It was a bad day for all of us, sir.
Under no circumstances do anything,
but call as soon as you...
Yes, I have the number.
Bye.

- NICOLE: You go to the opera? Bye.
- DOC: Goodbye.
There's something going on
here that we don't know about.
- Can't you be more specific?
- Yes.
I almost got my ass blown
off at the flea market.
I'd like to find out by whom and why.
Also, LeClerc was not expecting me.
You sure you're not overusing
your limited imagination?
The bomb was not imaginary.
Three bombs a day have gone
off since the strikes began.
- I know that.
- Everyone with a grievance is busy.
- Am I crazy?
- Yeah, you're crazy.
- But you'll check it out?
- Of course.
Why do you need to be reassured?
We use you because you're the best.

Boss Tweed, around 1875...
Boss, is that his name? Boss?
No, that's his nickname.
William Marcy Tweed.
- Marthy...
- I'll write it down for you.
They called him Boss,
because he was a corrupt politician.
He had a bunch of political
hacks called "the Tweed ring".

I took your book. I didn't

I was embarrassed,

Why do you pursue people

I don't. It's just

I can't talk about how smart you are.
I don't know you. I'm done lying.

Some interviews about Dad. Read them.
Not interested.
I just want you to read it.
Face it. The old man is dead.
He was a drunk. He killed himself.
He didn't start to drink

I got it from his friends.

- You're throwing your life away.

Nothing you write will change that!
- Give me the courtesy to read it!
- It's over! Forget it!
Maybe for you.
Do you want me to become
a corporate hustler like you?
- My life's thrown away, anyway.

I'm supposed to be the

I'm the best because
people think I am the best.
I'm past it. I know it. Soon it'll

Boy, something has gotten you.

I'm glad you came down.

- About 1962.
Excuse me, sir. Would you

Why?
It's a rule of the house.
You have to wear a tie here.

ELSA: I suppose all.
DOC: I'm not that familiar
with Switzerland.
What part are you from?
A tiny place. Verbier.
Verbier?
- I don't believe it!
- What?
A guy in my office, a ski bum,
a pain in the ass about skiing.
Excuse me.
He's always going on about Verbier.
Right at the foot of Mount Rosa?
- It's the best skiing in the world. True?
- Of course.
- DOC: Was he 100% right?
- ELSA: Sure.
You must know Claude LeSeur.
- Have you skied with him?
- Yeah!
Where is it?
- Verbier.
- Verbier.
I've made all this up.
There's no Mount Rosa in
Verbier or Claude LeSeur.
You're not Swiss. What are you?
What are you?
- Can't you guess?
- Sure. German.
- ELSA: Anything else?
- How long are your papers good for?
Wait. If this is a joke,
it's not funny.
I don't need work papers.
I'm a student here.
Many foreigners marry Americans
to make things legal.
- Then the marriages don't work out.

Why don't you ask me if I
love him? Why don't you...

Why? To upset me?

Not after what you've been pulling.
- I've done nothing.
- So Chen acted on his own?
I don't mind you hiring him,
but getting my brother involved?
- It was nothing.
- It was a violation.
We do not involve family, ever.
Think of it as a warning.
Nothing more.

You'd like to fight, wouldn't you?
It will not happen.
I'm much too old and
far too smart for that.
But we must talk. Truthfully.
- Are you to be trusted?
- No.
Is that the truth, or are you
trying again to upset me?
- You'll go to the bank sooner or later.
- Perhaps I've already been.
If so, you wouldn't be here with me.
- What else do you know?
- I know you're panicking.
- You think you'll get robbed.
- Who would do that?
- Obviously, you think I would.
- Well?

We're talking of my safety.

Please put the papers down.

Take it easy. What's in the papers?
It's a paper I'm writing.

It has nothing to do with it.

you can understand that, right?
Good evening, sir.

I'm sorry to intrude. I was

My name is Peter Janeway.
Call me Janey. All my friends do.
I'm not your friend.
Listen.
- I'm anxious as you to find who did this.
- I'm a little more anxious.
- I think it may have been political.
- Political? Why?
Considering what your brother did.
And your father, of course.
- What about my father?
- He was H.V. Levy, for Christ sakes.
He's been dead for 20 years,
and he was innocent.
What are you saying?
Get off my back! They've been
after me for two hours!
I didn't mean to imply...
They told me they were done!
What are you saying?
I'm sorry.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Come in.
Listen...
Why don't we begin with
what happened tonight, hmm?
Perhaps you could give
me some of the details.
I was here. Doc died. You came.
That's it?
I'm a demon for details.
- You want me to explain, then?
- That's right.
- Where did your brother live?
- In Washington.
- What did he do?
- Oil business.
Wrong.
I know exactly how
Doc made his living.
The closest he got to the oil business
was when he filled up with gas.
- Tell me what you're talking about.
- All right. Follow me.
Doc lived in Washington,
which is the centre of...
- Government.
- Correct.
All the branches are competitive.
Truth is they're all
paranoid schmucks.
When the gap gets too large between
what the FBI can handle effectively
and what the CIA doesn't
wanna deal with, we step in.
- Who's we?
- The Division.
- And my brother worked with you?
- Yes.
You're full of shit.
- What do you do exactly?
- We provide.
- Provide what?
- Anything.
And you two work together?
Why didn't Doc tell me?
Why did he lie to me?
He was afraid you'd be
disappointed in him, I expect.
We were very close for
many years. Believe me.
I know whereof I speak.
Doc was desperate to get here.
Remember anything he said?
He said my name a couple of times.
Okay, I'm just guessing now,
but whoever killed him will
probably want to speak to you.
- I don't know anything.
- They won't know till they talk with you.
I'm staying across the park,
at The Carlyle,
and if you don't mind,
I'd like to use you as bait.
- Bait.
- Yes.
- Will they come tonight?
- No.
I know it's risky, and I don't wanna
force you to do it. It's up to you.

MAN 1: Tub.
MAN 2: All right.
(CREAKING)
MAN: (WHISPERING)
All right, I got it. Here it is.
Turn it off. All right.
Shit. Jesus!
Shit.

BABE: Help!
Help! Help! Please!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Help!

(GASPING)
Is it safe?
Is it safe?
Are you talking to me?
- Is it safe?
- Is what safe?
- Is it safe?
- I don't know what you mean.
I can't tell you if
something is safe or not
unless I know specifically
what you're talking about.
Is it safe?
Tell me what the "it" refers to.
Is it safe?
Yes, it's safe. It's very safe.
So safe you wouldn't believe it.
Is it safe?
No, it's not safe.
It's very dangerous. Be careful.
Relax, relax.
Come on. Open. Open. It's okay.
- That hurt? I should think it would.
- Uh-huh.
You should take better
care of your teeth.
You have quite a cavity here.
- Is it safe?
- I told you I can't tell you... (SCREAMS)
- Think he knows?
- Of course. He's being very stubborn.
No, please. Please don't. No.
SZELL: It's okay.
Is it not remarkable?
Simple oil of cloves and
how amazing the results.
Life can be that simple.
Relief, discomfort.
Now, which of these I next apply,
that decision is in your hands,
so take your time and tell me.
- Is it safe?
- Please...
Please stop.
- MAN 1: Take him.
- MAN 2: I got him.
More.
Thank you.
More.
(GROANS)
(YELLING)
Thank you. Thank you.
Things are coming together.
Down, or your head gets blown off.
Those two guys I wasted
work for Christian Szell.
- Know that name?
- No.
He did experiments at Auschwitz.
He was called The White Angel,
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i>, due to his white hair.
The wealthiest and most
wanted Nazi left alive.
He's hiding out in Uruguay.
In '45, Szell told Jews in Auschwitz
he'd help them escape for a price.
He started out with gold, naturally,
but went on to diamonds.
Heard this?
Szell saw the end early.
His brother took the
diamonds to America
to a safe deposit box in New York.
Szell's brother had the key.
The only other key
Szell kept in Uruguay.
If he comes out to use it,
he'll expose himself to great risk.
Everything went fine till his
brother got killed by an oil truck.
Why was it natural
to start with gold?
He took it from the Jews'
teeth before he burned them.
Szell was a dentist.
He's not coming to America,
Mr Janeway. He's here.
No. We'd have known it.
The dentist almost killed me.
He kept saying, "Is it safe?"
White hair? Keep your head down!
Did he have white hair?
He was bald.
He's shaved his head!
He's here, and he's panicked.
- Why is he after me?
- Your brother was a diamond courier.
Szell thinks Doc said something
to you before he died.
- Did he?
- You say my brother worked for Szell?
No! He worked for us.
Everything we do cuts both ways.
Szell ratted on all his buddies.
He kept track on all the Nazis.
When we wanted to bring
one in, we went to Szell.
Babe, you gotta do one
thing for me, just one thing.
- Quit protecting Doc!
- I'm not.
- He kept alive to say something.
- He didn't.
- He must have. Tell me!
- Nothing!
Shit!
I thought you killed them.
You killed them!
You killed them!
You killed them!
You fucking killed them!
You killed my brother!
I don't think he knows anything.
I think he knows too much.
You can afford to think
what you wish. I can't.
The gun had blanks,
the knife a retractable blade.
Hardly original, but effective enough.
I think you'll agree.
(WATER RUNNING)
I'm told you are a graduate student.
Brilliant, yeah?
You're an historian,
and I am part of history.
I should have thought you
would have found me interesting.
Frankly, I am disappointed
in your silence.
Why do you have so little accent?
I had alexia as a child.
Alexia is a disease...
I know, it's where you can't
understand written speech.
Highest marks.
At any event, my writing is childish still,
but I'm a fanatic about spoken language.
I envy you your school days.
Enjoy them.
It's the last time in your life
no one expects anything of you.
I know I behaved terribly,
but I had to be sure what you knew.
You see...
I'm positive your
brother meant to rob me
when I left the bank
with my diamonds.
I don't know anything.
- Did Scylla plan the robbery alone?
- Robbery?
- You know the value of diamonds?
- No, I don't.
Neither do I. Not in today's market.
Tomorrow, I must go and find
out before I go to the bank.
You see...
Your brother was incredibly strong.
Strength is often inherited.
He died in your arms.
He travelled far and in
great pain to do that.
(WHIRRING)
There has to be a reason.
I don't know anything.
Karl!
(YELLS)
Please don't worry.
I'm not going into that cavity.
That nerve's already dying.
A live, freshly-cut nerve
is infinitely more sensitive,
(WHIRRING)
so I'll just drill into a healthy
tooth until I reach the pulp.
Unless, of course,
you can tell me that it's safe.
(WHIRRING LOUDLY)
(SCREAMING)
SZELL: Erhard!
He knew nothing. If he'd known,
he would have told.
Get rid of him.
JANEWAY:
I don't think you've heard the news.
- What is that?
- Your flight is at 1:00 tomorrow.
- You are a very confident young man.
- It's all a front.
Just think of me as any
young executive on the come.
You're uncontrollable.
What you offer us is valuable, but it's
not worth the chaos you're causing.
And if I'm unable to conclude
my business by 1:00?
You'll just have to
manage that, won't you?
As far as we're concerned,
Mr Szell, you're a relic.
And you're on your way.
I find you rather detestable.
May I say that without
hurting your feelings?
Praise from Caesar.
I'm just doing my job.
I believe in my country.
So did we all.
Jesus!
Come on, unlock it.
(GRUNTS)
JANEWAY: Get up.
Get him!
(SIREN WAILING)
Hey!
Stop!
(GUN FIRING)
- He went around the corner.
- Get the fucking car!
(PANTING)
(FIRING)
He's on the north ramp.
Come on, for Christ sakes!
(HONKING)
JANEWAY:
Run him down! Run him down!
What the fuck...
(HORN BLARING)
Why are you walking away?
You guys are crazy!
BABE:
No, don't slow down. Keep going.
You can drop me at the corner.
- Do you have a dime for the phone?
- DRIVER: What, a dime?
Here. Take this and
just give me a dime.
Wait. Let me see what you got.
It's a Rolex. My brother's watch.
Hey, come on.
Please.
Here is a dime, man.
Here's some more change.
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Elsa.
<i>Babe? What's the time?</i>
I don't know. About 5:00.
I want you to do something
for me, to meet me.
<i>- Where?</i>
- 51st and Broadway.
<i>- I can't.</i>
- There's an all-night drugstore.
<i>Why? Tell me what...</i>
Just get hold of a car.
Please. In an hour.
<i>- But why?</i>
- I'll tell you later.
- 51st and Broadway.
<i>- 51st and Broadway.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>
(BUZZING)
(WOMAN PROTESTING)
Mrs Melendez, I have to
see your son, it's important.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(BUZZING)
<i>MAN: I'll cut your finger off if
you don't let go of that buzzer!</i>
Melendez, it's me. I want
you to do a job for me.
<i>One more time and I'm coming
down with the butcher knife!</i>
Please. I'm from across the street.
I want you to do something for me.
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- It's Tom Levy from across the street.
<i>- Who the fuck is this?</i>
- Tom... Creepy. It's the Creep.
<i>- Creepy?</i>
- Open up.
(DOOR BUZZES)
What happened to you?
Come here. Listen, man,
it's past my bedtime.
I want you to rob my apartment.
Why?
Some guys are after me.
I got a gun in my desk.
And get me some clothes.
What's in it for me?
I got a TV set. I got a hi-fi.
You can take it all. Do it.
What's the catch?
The catch is it's dangerous.
Please do it.
That ain't the catch, it's the fun.
Come on.
(DOG BARKING)
(RATTLING)
All right, guys. Let's go,
move out of there.
Blow it out your ass, motherfucker.
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
(DOOR SLAMS)
- Hi.
- Hi, Elsa.
- How... Babe, what's happened?
- God, I'm glad you're here.
- What's happened to you?
- I'll tell you later. Let's go.
(WINDCHIME TINKLING)
You like it?
I must get the key.
- How did you find this place?
- I hope the key is here.
How did you find it?
A girlfriend in my building.
It belongs to her family. Ah.
Is it Szell's?
Szell's?
Is it Szell's?
You're very tired.
Where is Janeway?
Huh?
- What do you do for Szell?
- Babe...
- What?
- I'm sorry...
Tell me when they're coming.
What did you do for him?
- Let me explain.
- Explain it.
- Explain my brother! Say it!
- Please. Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
Tell me when they're coming.
I don't know, Babe. I...
Soon.
Good.
Thanks.
- When did you know?
- I didn't.
Till now.
Whose house is this?
ELSA: Szell's brother's.
(BANGING)
No, Babe. There's
nobody here. Let's go.
(SHUSHES)
Please, Babe. Let's go.
We still have time.
I can get you out of here.
BABE: So that was Szell.
- What's keeping them?
- ELSA: I don't know.
What were you?
Were you Szell's mistress?
- Tell me.
- No. I was a courier. Nothing more.
I took money from Paris
into Uruguay, that's all.
I never even met him.
God, you are pretty.
BABE: Where is he?
Where is Szell?
- Where is Szell?
- It's a lovely morning.
BABE: Hold it!
We're awaiting further instructions.
Do we take three giant steps or what?
Cops will be here soon.
I don't think the police are coming.
Neither do I, but I could be wrong.
We can work out what you wanna
work out, but shouldn't we do it inside?
Okay. One at a time.
No! Over here. Over here.
Sit. Sit!
You should realise we're only
authorised to go to certain limits.
Cut the bullshit.
Tell me where Szell is.
Why did you let us get so close?
You're all in my killing range now.
Taken target practice, have you?
A wizard at hitting paper?
It's not the same with flesh.
Smashing bone is different...
I wanna know where...
Hey.
...Szell is.
If the police were coming,
you wouldn't be so panicky.
- BABE: They're coming.
- Somehow I don't believe that.
Turn it on.
Easy. Easy.
We're all gonna take it easy.
Isn't that right, Erhard?
We're all just gonna sit here and
wait for the police, right, Karl?
Where is he?
Elsa, why don't you move away,
give the boy some room to breathe?
No!
- Drop it! Get it down!
- All right, it's down!
I didn't want this to happen,
but I couldn't trust them.
I'll give you Szell for your brother.
He's at a bank at 58th and Madison.
Go.
Go!
Babe! (GRUNTS)
(YELLS)
- What are you looking for, sir?
- Anything we can show you today?
Morning, sir. Anything I
could interest you in today?
We heard that you were not there,
but I wouldn't say it was relevant.
I can't give you that much.
That much I don't make.
DEALER:
Okay. Maybe we can make a trade.
No trade, I want cash for the ring.
If you want cash, I'll give you cash.
Let me take a look at it.
I'd like to see a
three-carat diamond.
Why? If you just wanna see,
go window-shop.
- I was interested in...
- First there's gotta be trust.
So I'll get this three-carat stone.
We'll take it to this
independent appraiser I know.
If he doesn't swear I'm practically
giving this stone away,
I just have to get myself
a new brother-in-law.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna do you a big favour.
- Can't you just tell me what it's worth?
- I'm no high-pressure artist. I sell value.
You never answer me!
SZELL:
I'm only interested in gem quality.
Around the size of
my little fingernail.
DEALER: You're talking
six carat, sir. More probably.
- Would that be prohibitive?
- Fifteen thousand.
Fifteen...
Per carat, naturally.
Naturally.
MAN: I know you.
Perhaps you do. I'm pretty
good at faces myself.
- I know this man.
- Christopher Hesse. How do you do?
Christopher Hesse. How do you do?
Wait, let me think.
I think...
Surely, you came to our
antique shop in London?
No, that wasn't it.
- No? But you've been to London?
- But I don't think...
Hesse of Golders Green, since '33,
when we got out of Germany.
Our shop is quite fashionable now.
I always wanted to visit London.
I suggest you hurry
while it's still there.
I thank you for your time. I'm sorry,
90,000 is far too high for me.
Our little shop isn't that
fashionable. Thank you.
I know that man.
It can't be... Szell?
Szell.
Szell!
Szell! Szell!
My God! Stop him!
Szell! Stop Szell!
It's Szell. <i>Der Weiße Engel!</i>
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i> is here.
Oh, my God. Stop him.
Stop him! <i>Der Weiße Engel!</i>
<i>Der Weiße Engel.
He has to be stopped.</i>
My God! He gets away.
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i> is here!
Szell. Stop him! Oh, please help me.
He's a beast. He's a murderer.
You must stop him.
Oh, my God, there he goes!
He's getting away!
MAN: She's crazy.
<i>Der Weiße Engel</i> is here!
Stop him! Stop him!
I will stop him! I will stop him!
- The beast! The beast!
- (TYRES SREECHING)
(HONKING)
(PEOPLE CLAMOURING)
Szell!
I know who you are, you murderer.
I know who you are!
Help! Help!
The man needs help here!
Help! Quick! A doctor! Quick!
58th Street and Madison.
(DOOR BUZZING)
- Morning, sir. Thank you.
- Thank you.
GUARD: Two-five-nine-six-six.
All finished, Henry. Thank you.
- Everything all right, Mrs Rosenheim?
- Yes. See you next week.
There you are, sir.
Close the door for the light, sir.
No one can enter.
Ha!
Everything all right, sir?
Yeah!
Yes!
BABE: It isn't safe.
Move.
They're all dead. Move.
SZELL: You'd be foolish
to do anything hasty.
BABE: Move.
SZELL:
I have things in my possession...
BABE: Just keep moving.
<i>DISPATCHER: Name is Arnie, walks
with a limp, green jacket, brown pants.</i>
<i>Ten-four.</i>
- What are you guys doing in here?
- BABE: We'll just be a little while.
- There's nobody allowed in here.
- Well, get out!
Get out!
Hurry up!
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
Okay, let's see what you got.
If you will just give me a
chance to get this open.
That's okay. Take your time.
All this happened because you were
afraid you were gonna be robbed?
Yes.
But you weren't sure.
No.
Jesus Christ.
I was in a state
of hysteria, you know.
Don't you want to take
a closer look than that?
- No.
- You see...
In a sense, one becomes
more emotional with age.
First after a lifetime of being
taken by friends and enemies alike,
and then, just when you think
you have your possession sure,
your health begins to go.
- That is, of course, the ultimate theft.
- That's close enough.
- In the circumstances, one's paranoia...
- Close enough!
- ...gets out of hand.
- Stop!
Well?
What are you going
to do now, shoot me?
No, I don't think so.
Then you'll take these from me.
If I could say a word about that?
No, you can keep them.
You can keep as many
as you can swallow.
Pardon me, I'm not quite
sure what you said.
Swallow?
Yeah, swallow.
Eat.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
- You're joking.
- No, I don't think so.
I'm not joking.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
(YELLS)
No, wait!
That man who was here
has seen your gun!
He'll bring others!
Swallow!
This is madness!
Swallow.
Again.
No.
I won't.
You'll have to shoot me.
Come on.
Shoot.
You won't.
You can't.
You're too weak.
Your father was weak in his way,
your brother in his, now you in yours.
You are all so predictable.
(YELLING)
Go get them!
