Try to imagine:
 Colonel Gray's secretary.
Unbelievable. A real Hoover.
She's wanted my ass for months.
Jody called in sick.
- You're on desk duty.
 - My ass.
Stay on the radio.
 The fog's a bitch tonight.
I saw some activity at Fort Point.
Patti Jean, give me a call
 if you get cold.
I got a jacket.
- It's not the same as a man.
 - Neither are you.
Unit One Foxtrot is 10-8.
Unit One Foxtrot to Dispatch 297.
Scared away a couple of lovebirds.
Judging by the car,
 they could afford a motel room.
- 10-4. Stay on the handset.
 - Yes, Daddy.
One Foxtrot to Dispatch 297.
Checking an open door
 at Officers' Club.
Wait for Unit Two Bravo
 to back you up.
Stay where you are, Patti Jean.
 Bud's leaving right now.
Freeze!
Presidio, this is Unit One Bravo.
 I've had an accident.
Suspect vehicle,
 light-coloured Lincoln
heading southbound
 on Bernard from Presidio.
He ran me off the road!
 Sonofabitch!
Shit! Hang on.
We've got him! He's heading
 for the Arguello Gate.
Stay on the base, Zeke.
 Don't pursue off base.
SFPD will be notified.
 They will respond.
Do you read me?
Zeke, answer me, damn it!
We'll cut him off!
- You all right?
 - Yeah.
Hey, scuzzball.
What's this, plant food?
Come on, Ace. That's not my stuff.
- No?
 - No.
I borrowed this vest from a friend,
 and it belongs to him.
That's what it is.
Is that right?
All units. Possible 459.
Lincoln eastbound on Lombard.
Come on, Schmitty. Let's move.
Hang in there, Leroy.
Save this for me till we get back.
- Gentlemen, this isn't legal.
 - So sue us!
We are in pursuit southbound
 on Arguello from California,
at speeds of over 70mph.
Roger, Edward Five. All units
 in the area, please respond.
Edward Five, eastbound California.
Roger, Edward Five.
Austin.
Yeah. Be right there.
Howard, I'll give you
 one more chance.
- Who were you with?
 - I don't know shit.
You're too dumb
 to have done this by yourself.
Come in. When you were in the army,
weren't you stationed
 at the Presidio?
Why?
You're going to handle a shooting.
Colonel Caldwell's in charge.
Yeah. I know him. I don't like him.
So? Don't take any shit.
This doesn't look good for you.
This'll be your third time down.
Third time. Ooh. That's the big one.
- Eat shit!
 - You're wrong.
I'm gonna be eating in restaurants.
You'll be in the slam forever.
Shit is what you'll be eating.
 It's their best entr√©e!
Howard is beginning to see the light.
- You'll be OK. I'll get help.
 - My heart!
- Priest.
 - What?
Right there!
You move, and I'll kill the cop!
Take your gun out.
 Drop it and kick it to me.
Do it,
 or I'll fucking blow him away!
- Don't give him your gun.
 - You want to die, cop?
Nope. Do you?
- Put the gun away.
 - Give me the gun!
Think about it, pal.
You shoot me,
 he's going to shoot you.
No. Keep your eyes on me,
 or I'll kill you.
I'll do it!
Either way, you're dead.
- I'll shoot!
 - You keep saying.
You're not gonna do it.
He's got his hand on his gun.
It's not quite
 working out right, huh?
Live or die. Your choice.
I need some help in here now!
OK, everybody. Let's go.
 Move back. Let's go.
It doesn't concern you. Let's go.
The show's over. Come on. Back.
Zeke, how's it hanging?
Austin. What in the hell
 are you doing here?
- No shit?
 - No shit.
You didn't steal that?
What happened, some officer
 shoot himself in the foot?
It's Patti Jean.
 She never had a chance.
- I'm sorry, Jay.
 - Is the old man inside?
If there's anything I can do...?
It's a kentia palm, sir.
I don't care what it's called.
 When did you last water it?
Excuse me, Colonel,
 should I type up my report?
Who are you?
John Mueller.
 I manage the Officers' Club.
You checked the inventory?
Yes, but there's nothing
 to steal, just supplies.
No? Somebody wanted something
 because they killed that girl.
- Yes, sir.
 - Don't call me sir.
Anything missing?
No, sir... I mean, no. Nothing.
- The rear door's been jimmied.
 - Yeah, I noticed that.
My people will handle this now.
- Don't you guys touch anything.
 - Oh, really?
Listen to me.
We've got a multi-jurisdictional
 investigation involving the army
and the San Francisco Police
 Department. That's me.
CID still handles felonies,
 don't they?
So, unless I miss my guess,
you're still the provost marshal.
Sir.
- Are you done?
 - Maybe.
Listen, boy.
I was prepared to cut you some
 slack because of Patti Jean.
Well, your time's up,
 so listen real good.
This is my command here.
You watch your mouth
 when you're here.
Or I might cut off your balls
 and serve them for breakfast.
- Do you understand me?
 - Oh, yes, sir.
Good.
Mueller, did you water this plant?
Say something.
- What?
 - That's a start.
I'm Inspector Jay Austin,
 San Francisco Police Department.
- Who are you?
 - You didn't do that right.
You're supposed to show me your ID.
Close the door.
- What?
 - Close the door.
Hello. Inspector Austin,
 San Francisco Police Department.
I'm looking for Colonel Caldwell.
He lives here.
 He works somewhere else.
I figured that.
You wanna wait
 on the porch, Inspector?
No, I wanna come in.
Donna Caldwell,
 the colonel's daughter.
You here about the MP
 killed last night?
The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
Such a small post. No excitement.
I know. I was an MP
 under your father's command.
- I never knew he had a daughter.
 - Why did you leave the army?
- I had my reasons.
 - Was my father one of them?
- Yeah.
 - You're very pretty.
- Is it hard?
 - Is what hard?
- Being a policeman.
 - Oh, yeah.
Inspector Austin,
 are you flirting with me?
I thought
 it was the other way around.
Your father will
 tell you things about me.
- What things?
 - Nothing good.
Are they true?
Find out for yourself.
 Want to have dinner tonight?
- You don't waste time.
 - How do I get hold of you?
I should have made decaf.
He'll be here any minute.
 He's an intelligent guy.
He'll see us talking
 and figure out what's going on.
- What?
 - You're attracted to me.
He'll be climbing the walls.
 Later, when you're alone,
he'll order you
 to stay away from me.
He won't. We have an agreement.
- He'll break it.
 - No. We made it when I was seven.
- You were never seven. Free tonight?
 - I'm a free woman.
My card. My home address is on it.
 Here's my phone number.
Call me.
You remember Jay Austin?
Yeah. I remember.
He remembers you.
What are you doing in my house?
Ballistics matched the weapon
 used to kill the patrolman -
the slugs match
 the ones in Patti Jean.
- So?
 - They're from a Tokarev 33.
So it's Russian.
It's still a long way
 to come for coffee.
- What do you want?
 - I thought you could help.
My instincts tell me
 it belongs to someone on the base.
Your instincts suck.
It could belong to a Russian.
 They have a consulate, remember?
Or it could be
 a Vietnam veteran's war trophy.
I'll ask you once more.
 What do you want?
I asked Sergeant Garfield
 at the pistol range
if anyone owned
 a Tokarev on the base.
He said there might be.
When I asked for more information,
he suddenly got amnesia
 and threw red tape in my face.
And you want me to talk to Garfield.
You said you only
 wanted to go through CID,
and I was just a provost marshal.
Tell you what. Forget it.
Wait!
Let's go.
- Afternoon, sir.
 - At ease, Sergeant.
This is Inspector Austin,
 San Francisco police.
- I phoned about a Tokarev 33.
 - Yeah.
- You got one stored here?
 - Nope.
When we spoke, you mentioned
 you might have some information.
That's right, but you didn't ask
 about information.
You asked if the weapon
 was stored here.
This is fun.
Yeah, I'm having fun.
 Are you having fun?
All right, what information
 do you have about a Tokarev 33?
I worked on one
 for an officer, as a favour.
It had a busted firing pin.
I made him a new one
 from tooled steel...
His name?
Godammit, forget him.
 Face me. The name.
- Colonel Lawrence.
 - Paul Lawrence?
You knew.
You goddamn knew.
That's all, Sergeant.
Did I say something I shouldn't?
- Let's talk to him.
 - No way.
I'll get a warrant.
Just try to serve it
 on a federal reservation.
Since you got back here,
 you've pissed on me like I'm a tree.
You thought you didn't need me.
So, suddenly it's different... No.
If you want to talk to Colonel
 Lawrence, you do it my way. OK?
What happened between you two
 was long ago.
You were wrong then,
 and you're wrong now.
And if you want
 to do anything with my help,
you're going to do it the proper way.
- You coming?
 - I'll walk.
.. Air Force academy as a freshman
and decided to become a civilian.
The bears on the one. Gilbert.
There's MacDougal, going in motion.
There's a hand-off,
 a dive, and he doesn't get in.
Who's winning?
The bad guys, probably.
 You're going out dressed like that?
- Like what?
 - You can see through that dress.
- Why bother wearing one?
 - There's a thought.
Good night.
You're going to see Austin,
 aren't you?
That's not a good idea.
- He said you'd say that.
 - Did he say why?
- That's between you two.
 - Don't get in the middle.
- I don't tell you who to see.
 - Of course you don't!
I don't think I'd choose Myra,
the redhead who makes you
 breakfast on Thursday mornings.
That's different.
There are things you don't know.
- He was an MP, I was his CO.
 - He said.
- He said a lot.
 - Some.
Don't be fooled.
 He doesn't respect women.
And you respect Myra enormously.
 I certainly do!
He'll use you to get at me.
Gonna fight again?
Look. I care what happens to you.
I know that.
 What is with you two anyway, huh?
It happened two years ago.
 You were away at school.
- He and Patti were patrolling.
 - The girl who was shot?
They pulled over Paul Lawrence,
 who was drunk, words were exchanged,
- and Austin blew up.
 - Blew up?
He said Lawrence insulted the girl,
so he beat him and put him in jail.
And you went down
 and took Lawrence home.
Even if Lawrence had
 insulted the girl,
he can't justify beating him up.
- Depends on the insult.
 - He was out of line for an MP.
You're defending someone
 you don't know!
- I'll find out about him.
 - I don't want you seeing him.
- Is that an order?
 - Yes, it is.
And what about our agreement?
Yeah. He told me
 you'd break that, too.
Don't wait up for me. I'll be late.
Shit on a stick.
- Hi.
 - Hi.
- Am I late?
 - 10 minutes.
10 minutes isn't late.
In my house,
 they'd call out a search party.
You look great.
- People say I look like my father.
 - Christ, what a thought!
- He knows where you are?
 - Yeah.
I got a question,
 I need a straight answer.
- It's all I got.
 - Why'd you ask me to dinner?
Why do you think?
My father thinks you're using me.
- And you?
 - I'm not sure.
Your father and I don't like
 each other. That's no secret.
There was an incident
 at the Presidio.
I busted a Colonel Lawrence, who
 was drunk. I threw him in the tank.
Did you beat him up first?
Yeah, I told you your father
 would tell you a lot of garbage.
You also told me
 to find out for myself.
He resisted arrest,
 then started on my partner, a woman.
Oh. Were you involved
 with your partner?
She was my partner.
 Lawrence took a swing at me, missed.
I hit him - once.
- Were you out of line?
 - No way. He deserved it.
And the son of a bitch demanded
 they court martial me.
So in walked your father.
What a sight - not a wrinkle on him.
He didn't want to know why.
 He didn't care.
"Why?" isn't in his book,
 just "how much? When? What?"
There was an officer involved.
That's all that mattered,
 not my word.
I was just one of his men.
You want to know
 what the colonel did?
Backed Lawrence.
He walked. I lost a stripe.
That's it. So I got out.
I'm interested in you,
 not your father.
- Prove it.
 - What?
The way I see it,
 we can do this two ways -
we sit here and wonder
 about being alone together...
or just cut to the chase.
- Pull across the street. Follow me.
 - No. You follow me.
You don't know where you're going.
What are you doing?
Gave me your address, remember?
Oh, God.
Come on.
Where you going?
I've gotta get back.
- I want to see you again.
 - I'll call you.
You take it easy.
 I'll do the talking, OK?
Good morning, sir.
 Colonel Lawrence is expecting you.
Thank you.
- Good to see you, Alan.
 - Paul.
What's he doing here?
- What is this?
 - It's official.
- Where's the gun, asshole?
 - You really are smooth.
- Where's the Tokarev?
 - Up yours!
The gun is part
 of a homicide investigation.
I don't have to answer
 his dipshit questions.
Listen to me, Paul.
 He can get a federal judge.
- Let him.
 - I don't want that.
I'll check the gun
 against those slugs.
When they don't match I'll return it,
 and this guy's gone forever.
- I don't have it.
 - Where is it?
I lost it at poker two weeks ago.
- To who?
 - None of your business.
- I'm making it my business.
 - Get out of my office!
Come on. I said come on.
When you leave the Presidio
 you'll be on my turf,
and I'll haul your ass.
I won't let you protect him again.
 You understand what I'm saying?
I'm impressed. You handled that
 really professionally!
You keep covering for him,
 we'll have serious problems.
Even with a head as empty as yours,
an occasional thought
 must creep in sometimes.
Like maybe we don't need the gun.
Maybe we already have a bullet.
Careful, don't try too much.
 You might pull something.
- Afternoon, sir.
 - At ease, Sergeant.
When you repaired Colonel Lawrence's
 Tokarev, did you test it?
Yes, sir. I capped it
 several times, Colonel.
Any chance you'd have the slugs?
They should be in the bottom
 of that barrel.
It should be easy to spot.
A Tokarev's only a 7.62 millimetre.
Should stick out like a sore thumb
against all these.45s
 and 9 millimetres.
Here's one here.
This came from
 Colonel Lawrence's Tokarev.
Thank you, Sergeant.
If this matches the slug
 taken from my MP and your cop,
I want your word
 that you'll go through me.
- Sure.
 - There's more.
If it doesn't match, get off
 Lawrence's back and stay off it.
Take it or leave it.
Deal.
Guy named Peale called yesterday,
 reported his Lincoln stolen.
Tough guy to see. Heavy money.
- So?
 - I won't ask you to come.
Probably wouldn't like it if you did.
 But if you want to, it's OK.
You're all charm and grace, boy.
Pick me up at the museum.
More American soldiers died
 in the civil war than any other.
- How come?
 - Both sides were American.
That's kind of lame.
This flag was at Fort Sumter
 when the war started.
- What's this?
 - Never mind. Come back over here.
Get him to tell you what it is.
Don't listen.
 He's mentally incompetent.
That's the medal of honour,
 our highest award.
Did you let that man in?
Look closely at that photograph.
That man is Lyndon Johnson.
 He was President.
That soldier won that medal.
Doesn't this place have security?
- Just anyone can walk in here?
 - Doesn't that soldier look familiar?
He wasn't nearly as ugly then.
Holy shit!
That relic there
 is Sergeant Major Maclure.
- Ask how he won the medal.
 - How old are you?
- Eight.
 - Wanna be nine?
It wasn't for charm.
 He won it in Vietnam. In the jungle.
When he was separated from his unit,
he found this wounded officer
 who was close to dying,
so he picked him up.
As he carried him towards
 the American lines,
he met an enemy group.
They were set up to ambush
 an American patrol,
so he put down the officer,
and with one M-16 and a few hand
 grenades, he attacked them.
He was one man against 50.
- 50?
 - He wiped them out.
And despite being wounded,
he got the officer,
 and carried him to safety.
- What's that gun?
 - A.45
The officer gave him it
 for saving his life.
- What's Vietnam?
 - A place where we fought a war.
- I never heard of it.
 - Well, it happened.
Did we kick ass?
I want you all to thank the Sergeant
 Major for giving us this tour.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You guys come back anytime, huh?
Did we kick ass?
- Thanks a lot.
 - Don't mention it.
I should've left
 your Scotch ass there.
Scotch is a drink. A man born
 in Scotland is a Scotsman.
Next time you're dying
 in the boonies, call a cab.
Still worried about Donna?
We can't have a conversation
 without blowing our tops.
She's not a little girl any more.
 Maybe you don't want her to grow up.
She's seeing Jay Austin.
 Remember him?
The MP who threw Lawrence
 into the pokey?
I never did like Lawrence.
 He's a monkey dick.
You're a big help.
 Austin's a cop now.
That female MP that was killed?
She was with Austin
 when they busted Lawrence.
The thought of bringing down Lawrence
 is giving Austin a hard-on.
- Is Lawrence involved?
 - I don't know.
The weapon was a Tokarev.
 Lawrence says he lost his at poker.
Did he?
- Lawrence isn't talking.
 - So maybe Austin's right.
- I don't want her seeing him.
 - It ain't up to you.
She's only seeing him
 because I don't want her to.
- Say you like him. she might stop.
 - He's wrong for her.
Would you listen if someone
 told you not to see somebody?
That's different.
Sure. Maybe you see a little
 of yourself in him.
What do you mean?
I remember seeing this 90-day wonder
 with an order manual in his pocket.
I said to myself, "The Army's
 finally found a way to screw me."
But you didn't turn out so bad.
 It took a little time.
Maybe Austin needs a little time.
- Anybody home?
 - Yeah. Over here.
- Hey, top. How you doing?
 - Oh, still kicking.
- Still got a big mouth?
 - I guess so.
Figures.
Just a little time.
Mr Peale will see you.
- This is Inspector Austin, Mr Peale.
 - Jay Austin.
Colonel Caldwell,
 Presidio Provost Marshal.
I'm Arthur Peale.
Can I get you guys something?
 Beer, coffee?
- No, thanks.
 - This is my assistant Mark Wallach.
- Pleasure.
 - Coffee for me, Mark.
How can I help you?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I assume it's about my car.
 Have you located it?
Your Lincoln was involved
 in a homicide Tuesday morning.
The one
 on the Chronicle's front page?
- Afraid so.
 - Mark, did you hear that?
The Lincoln was involved
 in a shooting.
- You're kidding.
 - When did you last use the car?
It's my wife's.
 We went out to dinner.
I left it here and drove home.
 Next morning, it was gone.
- What is Transcorp?
 - We're a holding company.
Fairly diversified at the moment.
Jewellery stores,
 shopping centres, that sort of thing.
Which restaurant did you visit?
Jake's. Seafood place on Broadway.
- How far away?
 - Thanks, Mr Peale.
Your car's being printed
 and processed.
You'll probably get it back
 inside 90 days.
Forget it, I just hope you find
 whoever shot those people.
Thank you.
Why were you in such a hurry?
 Late for a hairdressing appointment?
You're the one who's real big
 on jurisdictions.
This is my jurisdiction.
 I was conducting an investigation.
That was an investigation?!
 "Sorry to trouble you,
"but your car was used in a homicide.
 We're really sorry."
This may be hard
 for you to understand.
You're not in command.
You were in such a rush
 you didn't see what was on the table.
I put Peale through R&I,
 checked him up, down, sideways...
I don't like him, but he's clean.
OK. Where's the report
 on the Tokarev slug?
- Couple of hours.
 - Good.
Come on. I'll buy you some coffee.
Are you kidding?
No. No, I'm not kidding.
I want to talk to you about Donna.
Are you going to ask me
 my intentions?
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- You really are a piece of work.
 - What's so funny?
How's it hanging, Major?
- Wanna leave?
 - No. After my coffee.
- So...
 - Come on, Major.
I'm talking to you.
- Let it alone, boy.
 - Excuse me, Major?
- I said let it alone.
 - Did I hear the Major right?
Did he give ME an order?
You stink, Major.
What is that smell anyway, mothballs?
What are you going to do now, Major?
Are you sure you want a fight?
 I'll only use my thumb.
- Thumb?
 - My right thumb.
Left one's too powerful for you.
Come on!
Guys...
Keep it fair.
- Get up, man!
 - Come on!
I'll get him!
You see these little oak leaves?
 They're silver.
That means I'm a lieutenant colonel.
If they were gold,
 I'd be a major, understand?
- Yes, sir.
 - That's good.
Next time you see an army officer,
 you'll recognise his rank,
and he won't accidentally hurt you.
- Understand?
 - Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
 - About your daughter, sir,
I want you to know my intentions
 are strictly honourable.
I love this place.
Soldiers from all wars
 trade lies with each other.
Soldiers should rest together.
 They earned their peace.
I got a spot picked out for myself.
They closed the cemetery in 1962,
 but I've got special permission.
I'm next to a corporal
 from the Spanish-American war.
Boy, are we gonna trade stories.
I'm going to say, "Listen, Corporal,
 "stop telling me about those cannons.
"In 'Nam, we had Claymores, AK-47s.
"Now, they were real weapons."
- Dad told you to talk to me.
 - No. It was my idea.
You two been going
 15 rounds every day?
Yeah. It's like talking
 to a brick wall.
He can be a stubborn son of a bitch.
 You can't, right?!
- You like this kid Austin?
 - Yeah, I do.
We've been seeing each other a lot.
Not just to piss your old man off?
Maybe in the beginning.
 He wants me to marry Captain Gordon.
- That what you want?
 - No!
- Let HIM marry Captain Gordon.
 - That's what I told him.
This guy's different, though.
 He's just...scares me.
- Why?
 - I don't know.
He just...gets too close.
You're not afraid of HIM,
 you're afraid of YOU.
- I'm ugly, but I'm not stupid.
 - I think you're gorgeous.
Afternoon, Colonel.
- You have the storeroom key?
 - Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Is this about what I think,
 you sonofabitch?
That package you wanted located?
I found it. It's in Chinatown,
 1412 Washington.
- Hurry. It won't be there long.
 - Thanks.
- Surprise!
 - You can't arrest me.
Wrong. You're in the real world.
You're not a colonel,
 asshole, and I own you.
- You can't do it.
 - Guess what? I got a warrant.
I got a slug from your Tokarev,
 a ballistics match,
saying it's the one
 that killed Patti Jean.
You know what I'd like?
I'd like you to resist arrest...
 just a little.
God, I'd really like that.
You have the right
 to remain silent...
Get out of here!
Shit!
You were supposed to go through me.
 You gave me your word.
- He ran. I chased him.
 - You gave me your word.
I got a ballistics match
 and a clean bust. He did it.
- You realise what you've done?
 - Caught the killer.
Can you prove he pulled the trigger?
He proved it...by running.
Can you tell me why he broke
 into the Officers' Club?
Lawrence sure as shit can't!
You made a clean bust all right!
 You're a real prize.
You're wrong about Lawrence.
 He's part of all this.
I wasn't wrong about him.
 The truth is, I never liked him.
Then why didn't you back me?
You broke the law!
 You're the cop, he's the bad guy.
You still don't get it, do you?
Do you think Lawrence is the
 only one involved in all this?
I tried to tell you
 after we left Peale's office -
about the coasters on his table?
Coasters?
Yeah. From the Caravelle Bar
 in Saigon.
- You checked him.
 - He was clean.
If there's no conviction, he's clean!
 Did you check his service record?
- He never served.
 - He's got Vietnam souvenirs.
No, he collects coasters!
I ran a check myself
 through my people.
Peale was CIA. He was
 a province advisor in Long Binh
at the same time
 as Lawrence was there.
- They knew each other?
 - What do you think?
How would I know?
That's classified military shit!
 How could I find that out?
All I know is whoever broke into
 the storeroom wanted something bad.
Oh, Christ! The water.
One plant had water.
 The rest were dry.
There was an empty bottle
 that Mueller never opened.
- What about Mueller?
 - He's got an alibi.
Anyway, why break in? He's got a key.
I have the address
 of the water company.
- They open at 0900.
 - Pick you up at your quarters, 8:30.
Listen, I was...
- Follow my lead, OK?
 - No, it's not OK.
How are you handling it?
We don't want to tip anybody off.
Hey, I'm good at this.
- Hi.
 - All right!
I'm looking for the dispatcher.
You found her, man.
 Her name is Gloria.
Gloria.
- You follow the Dead?
 - Everywhere, man. You, too?
Yeah. First time I saw them
 was '73 at Winterland.
Flipped me right out.
 Been a fan ever since.
- Intense!
 - Did you do Oakland, New Year?
All six shows.
 I slept in the parking lot.
- It was mellow.
 - How many you seen?
Anaheim was 179.
My boyfriend hasn't missed one
 for four years.
I can't do that because of work.
His old man's got money.
 Work's such a drag, you know?
Who's General Washington?
- My father.
 - Bummer!
- Tell me!
 - He into elevator music?
What do you think?
Gloria, this is kind
 of embarrassing, you know,
but last week I borrowed
 my father's car.
Parked it outside the
 Officers' Club at the Presidio,
and someone banged into it.
I remembered seeing one of your
 delivery trucks making a delivery.
Maybe the driver saw something?
He doesn't believe me.
 He thinks I did it.
- He never believes you, right?
 - Yours any different?
You never heard it from me.
Officers' Club at the Presidio?
Deliveries are every Tuesday.
 Driver's name is Spota.
- He working today?
 - Day off. He's in tomorrow, 8:30.
- First name?
 - You?
- Jay.
 - First name George.
I like yours better.
Do you think you could give me
 his home address?
- No hassles.
 - I don't know, man.
Look at him. Does he look like
 he'd wait until tomorrow?
732 Vermont.
 You never heard it from me.
God, thanks.
- Can I send you something here?
 - Sure.
I've got a bootleg copy
 of the Dylan concert at Meadowlands.
I'll send you a copy.
- I don't know what to say, man.
 - Just say thanks.
Us Deadheads got to stick together.
Later.
- Hey, General.
 - Colonel!
You really ought to lighten up.
I'll try.
The guy who delivers water
 to the Officers' Club is named Spota.
- George Spota?
 - Yeah. How did you know that?
A Master Sergeant Spota
 served under Lawrence in Long Binh.
Maybe the same guy.
Anyway, he's off today,
 but he's back on tomorrow at 8:30.
Water was delivered to the Presidio
 the same day Patti Jean was killed.
- What in the hell's the Dead?
 - You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
- The Grateful Dead.
 - The Grateful Dead?
- Grateful Dead.
 - I don't understand.
That's a surprise.
There's something
 I want to check out.
- What?
 - I'll tell you tomorrow.
There's something
 I need to check, too.
Tomorrow.
I hated it, though.
Whenever I'd make a friend,
Dad would get orders
 to leave and I'd say goodbye.
I got to see a lot of great places.
Leavenworth, Kansas.
Always so special
 during the summer.
And who could forget
 Christmas at Fort Bragg?
What is going on in there?
 What are you thinking about?
Is what we've been doing
 enough for you, Donna?
What do you mean?
I don't know how to say this
 so I'll just say it.
What we've been doing
 has been...great.
It's been...games?
It's crazy 'cause
 this should be perfect for me.
What I'm trying to tell you is,
 I really care about you.
I'm just having trouble
 saying it, that's all.
Gareth Wooten, please.
Wooten. Alan Caldwell here.
Fine. How are things at Langley?
Careful, you'll get a sore ass
 sitting at a desk.
I need a favour.
There's a holding company
 out here called Transcorp.
T-R-A-N... I know you can spell!
Push one of your buttons and
 tell me what companies they own.
Thank you. I do appreciate it.
Oh, and give my love to Linda.
No. No, we're not even.
Just tell her she made a mistake.
I'm still much better-looking!
 Goodbye.
- Can we leave now?
 - I just ordered this drink.
- Please can we go?
 - May I have this dance?
Give it a rest.
Captain Gordon...
 Inspector Austin. He's a policeman.
- You're being very impolite, Jay.
 - You don't like it here?
- No, I don't, dickhead.
 - What did you say?
Why are you doing this?
- I won't do this.
 - I asked you a question!
Yeah, I heard you.
You push it, don't you?
 Right up to the edge.
Let's step outside.
You want me to fight this jerk
 for your hand?
You want to settle this
 like gentlemen?
- However you like.
 - Marquis of Queensberry rules.
There! That what you wanted to see?
Easy, Colonel. I'm done.
Whatever my intentions were,
 you can forget them.
She's dangerous.
You really are something.
Why did you bring him there
 in the first place?
Why not just throw in a hand grenade?
 It's quicker.
- Leave me alone.
 - Are you proud of yourself?
Ask yourself that question.
- What?
 - You set it up, not me.
What are you talking about?
Who I can or can't see.
You probably have
 it all written down.
You never ask me what I want.
 You always tell me.
I've news for you,
 I didn't enlist in your army.
- I decide what I do.
 - You're doing a wonderful job.
Without help from you, sir,
 just rules.
You decide what's fair or foul.
- This is ridiculous.
 - Don't turn your back.
- I won't stand your rubbish.
 - That's perfect.
You're done talking
 so there's nothing else to say.
- Right.
 - You coward.
- That's enough.
 - No, it's never enough.
What are you afraid of?
- You think I'm like her?
 - Stop.
You turned your back on her,
 didn't you?
- Stop!
 - Bastard, it was your fault!
Do it.
Colonel... Jesus!
 What the hell are you doing?
Getting drunk.
 What does it look like?
- Looks like you've done that.
 - I'm going to get drunker.
I'm going up on the roof.
- Why?
 - Your windowsill hurts.
- Why not come inside?
 - Because I'm outside.
- You know what time it is?
 - Who cares?
Well, I sure don't.
- Drink this all by yourself?
 - Yeah.
- You can keep that one.
 - Thanks.
- I've lost her.
 - Who?
Donna.
You didn't lose her.
 She's just grown up.
- You got to accept that.
 - Oh, yeah? She hates me.
No, she's trying
 to measure up to you.
Sometimes that ain't easy.
 You want perfection in people.
There's not a lot of perfect around.
- You know how much I love her?
 - Yeah, I know.
But it's important what SHE knows.
When was the last time you told her?
She knows.
I've known buildings
 easier to talk to than you.
Hey, was that my gun
 you pointed at me?
Yeah. I took it out of the museum.
- Why?
 - Just wanted to hold it for a while.
Well, what for?
I had my reasons.
 Give me some of that.
Sometimes I think it was easier
 winning that medal than wearing it.
Think anyone gives a shit about us?
We give a shit about them.
 That's what matters.
You know what I think?
I think America is like a big,
 fancy house...
and we're the Doberman pinschers.
- Doberman pinschers?
 - A guy hears a noise downstairs,
he's really happy
 to have his big, ugly dog, huh?
But...
the next day when his friends
 come around, he locks up the dog.
Why? 'Cause he's embarrassed.
But that night, he unlocks the dog
 to protect his fancy house.
If some guy comes
 and the dog doesn't bite his ass,
he's gonna smack him
 in the fucking mouth.
Yeah, it's like that.
I'll tell you something else -
and I remember this
 like it was yesterday -
when I was 10, my old man was laid
 off again, comes home and says,
"We're leaving Scotland.
 We're going to America,"
and gives me this book
 by Thomas Jefferson.
I read it all. Next thing,
 I'm on the deck of this ship.
My old man shouts,
 "Look, there she is."
I could just see over the guard rail.
 It's the Statue of Liberty.
And I look, and that green
 colour on her face.
You know,
 she really is that beautiful.
Anyway, that's how I see America.
Yeah. And that's why I'm a soldier.
We don't have to have thanks
 from anybody,
because it's... That's not important.
Or this.
Sergeant Major...
- I'm really drunk.
 - As a skunk!
The look on his face
 said he was scared.
I never saw that before.
My whole life, he's taught me
to never say too much.
Don't show too much.
 Never lose control.
That works,
because nobody can hurt you
 if you don't let anybody in.
I have to give him credit.
 He really taught me that well.
He even tries to keep me away,
 and that is what hurts.
And that's what
 I've been doing to you.
Go on.
So I've been trying
 not to lose control.
I could sleep with you,
 as long as it was on my terms.
I was doing OK that way,
 I really was.
Except the more time
 I spent with you...
the scarier it got.
That's why I behaved that way
 at the Officers' Club.
I couldn't run away
 from you any more.
I wanted you to run away from me.
I don't want to hurt you
 like that any more.
Because...
because I love you.
You're 10 minutes late.
Got some good news and some bad news.
- Oh. What's the good news?
 - Donna's with me.
That's good news?
- The bad news is, I love her.
 - So do I.
Shall we discuss
 my personal life all morning?
- Nope.
 - Good.
The car that killed Lawrence
 is registered to Spota.
Arthur Peale owns
 the Black Mountain Water Company.
He's in the second truck. Number 68.
- Recognise him?
 - Yeah. That's Sergeant Spota.
In front of everybody.
Always the most successful way.
 None of that covert shit.
Captain, where did you
 just come in from?
A contract flight from Clark, sir.
The Philippines?
Yeah. Clark Air Force base, Colonel.
- Come on. He's leaving.
 - Thank you.
- What's with the Philippines?
 - I don't know. Something.
Why water from the Philippines?
There's something in that bottle
 worth killing for.
Water from the Philippines
 is delivered to Spota.
Spota delivers it
 to the bottling company.
Except he makes a mistake.
He delivers the wrong bottle
 to the Officers' Club.
When he realises what he's done
 he comes back here.
Patti Jean surprises him,
 and he smokes her.
I wanna know what's in that bottle.
What's with you?
Nah, there's a piece missing.
Something about the Philippines.
 There's another hand in this.
There's a piece missing.
Peale, Lawrence, Spota...
 they knew each other in Vietnam.
They're all in it. What's missing?
Oh, shit!
He served with Lawrence in Vietnam.
They'd have to use him
 or somebody like him.
He knows every maintenance man
 in the Orient.
Everybody's gone. We're secure.
These are good quality.
 Our friend in Manila's done well.
Tell him he's stopping now.
- Why are you here?
 - You said no one would be hurt.
- No one was supposed to.
 - What about the girl?
- Lawrence has been dealt with.
 - That's not enough. It's over.
Too late for a conscience.
- It's over.
 - Who are you?
The infantry.
The war's long over, old man.
 Nobody cares.
Go back to your museum
 and play soldier.
You open your mouth again,
 I'll shove your head up your ass.
Where are you going?
Goddammit! Sonofabitch!
This is ridiculous.
I'm sure that we can reach
 some understanding.
Look, Sergeant, we're already
 sorry for what's happened,
but there's nothing
 we can do about it.
You don't seem to understand.
 It's over.
Just what will you accomplish?
I'm going to make it right.
You want to set off
 the goddamn alarm?
Here. You'll need this.
 We'll get our asses shot off!
- He wants more money.
 - I don't like you. Tell him.
Oh, come on. Open it.
I know you didn't want
 to be a part of this.
I know that you're a man of honour,
but Lawrence had something
 on you from Vietnam,
something about the black
 market, I don't know what.
You made a mistake a long time ago.
You didn't want your name ruined,
 so you looked away.
I can sympathise with that.
But there's no reason
 to ruin everything now -
your name along with it.
You'll only do yourself harm
 and everybody else.
I don't give a shit.
 I'm going to do what's right.
Somebody's inside.
 Let's get out of here.
Wrong!
We're back in the shit again,
 Colonel.
Maclure - Christ, why?
It doesn't matter.
They screwed up.
I'm going to make things right.
Don't.
Don't!
I want you to do something for me.
What?
Delay your report for 48 hours.
That'll give me time
 to bury him with his name.
He deserves that.
- Please?
 - OK.
Thanks.
None of us who knew
 Sergeant Major Ross Maclure
could ever accuse him
 of being perfect.
However, only God can judge him now,
 and I won't...
and I won't apologise for him.
He was my friend.
He was a soldier.
We used to joke
 that being in the army
is not a matter of life and death.
It's more important than that.
We first met in Vietnam.
He was my sergeant.
 I was his lieutenant.
To this day, I don't know
 who served under who.
And it was his luck to be a hero
 in a war nobody liked.
He said to me the other day
 that winning his medal
was a lot easier than wearing it.
This is the second time
I've lost someone
 who meant everything.
Whenever I've come
 to visit this place,
I only hear the silence,
 the sense of loss.
Maclure heard something else.
 For him, I hope it was right.
There were so many things
 that I wished...
I could have said to him...
and to others.
And now that he's gone,
 I realise that...
nothing should be left unsaid...
even between people
 who don't say things easily.
So, here we are...
in this place that he loved so much.
Here to say goodbye.
If I know Maclure...
he would be impatient
 to be on his way.
Ready...
Aim.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Take colours.
I'd like you to have this.
Do you want to go for a walk?
Yeah. I'd like that very much.
Come on.
