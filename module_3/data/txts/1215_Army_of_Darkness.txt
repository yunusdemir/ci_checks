My name is Ash. And I am a slave.
Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 AD...
...and I am being dragged to my death.
It wasn't always like this.
I had a real life once.
A job.
Hardware. Aisle 12.
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.
I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda.
Together we drove to a small cabin
in the mountains.
It seems an archeologist
had come to this remote place...
...to translate and study his latest find.
Necronomicon ex Mortis.
The Book of the Dead.
Bound in human flesh and inked in blood...
...this ancient Sumerian text contained
bizarre burial rites...
...funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.
It was never meant
for the world of the living.
The book awoke something
dark in the woods.
It took Linda.
And then it came for me.
It got into my hand and it went bad.
So I lopped it off at the wrist.
But that didn't stop it. It came back.
Big time.
For God's sake! How do you stop it?
Surround the stranger!
Where the hell...
Easy now, chief.
I don't know how I got here.
And I'm not looking for any trouble.
What a piece of armor this is!
Wiseman!
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.
He who is prophesied to fall
from the heavens...
...and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.
What? That buffoon?
Likely...
...he's one of Henry's men!
Kneel, rapscallion!
I say, to the pit with him!
- To the pit!
- You miserable bastard!
Get off of me!
Let me go!
To the castle!
Pick up your feet!
Stop dragging your feet! Come on!
Move along. Come on, now.
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this!
All right, you men!
You've got something to look forward to
when you get back to the castle!
Lord Arthur approaches!
Raise the portcullis!
Lord Arthur! Lord Arthur approaches!
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?
Aye, and fought valiantly.
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.
I'm sorry, Sheila.
- Come on.
- You cretin!
Stop it, you bastards!
Barbarians!
Stop it! Stop it, you little bastards!
Beat it!
Foul thing!
A pox on your throat!
Thou art a murderer!
A bloody murderer!
My brother's death shall be avenged!
Company, halt!
Get that yoke off him!
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.
Who are you?
Who wants to know?
I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.
Well, hello, Mister Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.
You ain't leading but two things right now,
jack and shit.
- And Jack left town.
- Shut your bleedin' hole!
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur!
There is an evil awakened in this land.
And while my people fight
for their very souls against it...
...you, Henry the Red, wage war on us.
Charlatan!
It was you who first turned
your swords on us.
And this evil has befouled
my people as well!
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...
...that lies in the bowels of that pit!
Right! You're no better!
May God have mercy upon your souls.
In God's name!
What hell-spawned thing lurks there?
Into the pit
with those bloodthirsty sons of whores.
Move!
No!
God! Heavenly God!
He's escaping!
Hold him!
They don't look so clever now, do they?
He's frightened!
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.
Hold it. Wait a minute!
You gotta understand, man.
I never even saw these assholes before!
He trembles!
What are you waiting for?
Henry, you gotta tell them
you don't know me.
We never met, tell them!
I do not think he'll listen, lad.
Look, I'm telling you.
You've got the wrong guy.
I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.
Why, you...
- Spikes.
- Hey, he said spikes! Give him spikes!
Make way! Strange one!
Strange one!
Damn you.
You know, your shoelace is untied.
All right.
Who wants some?
Who's next?
How about it?
Who wants some?
Who wants to have a little?
You.
You want some more?
You want a little?
Do you? You want some more?
Now, get on those horses
and get out of here.
Let them go!
Halt!
Thank you, generous hosts!
Sword boy!
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.
Sorcery!
Yeah.
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.
See this?
This is my boom stick!
It's a 12-gauge, double-barreled Remington.
S-Mart's top of the line.
You can find this
in the sporting goods department.
That's right, this sweet baby was made
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
It retails for about $109.95.
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt-blue steel, and a hair trigger.
That's right. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.
You got that?
Now, I swear...
...the next one of you primates...
...even touches me...
Now, let's talk about how I get back home.
I prithee to forgive me, my Lord.
I believed thee one of Henry's men.
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.
Blow.
So what's the deal?
Can you send me back or not?
Only the Necronomicon has the power,
an unholy book which we also require.
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.
Only you, the promised one,
can quest for it.
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit!
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto! Today! Chop...
You shall die!
You shall never take the Necronomicon.
We shall feast upon your souls!
It's a trick. Get an ax.
Guards! Kill her!
Capture the witch! Capture the witch!
My eyes! I'm blind! Oh, God, I'm blind!
No!
Yo, she-bitch!
Let's go.
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites...
...all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.
Now will thou quest for the book?
That one.
Groovy.
What's the matter, you raised in a barn?
Shut the door.
Probably was raised in a barn,
with all the other primitives.
The Wisemen say that thou art
the promised one.
'Tis said thou wilt journey for the book
to help us.
And that thou wilt lead our people
against the evil.
The only reason I'm going to get the book
is to get home.
I believe thou wilt be leaving
in the morning.
Don't touch that, please!
Your primitive intellect wouldn't
understand alloys and compositions...
...and things with molecular structures
and the...
What are you doing here, anyway?
I wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee...
...and I made this for thee.
Good. I could use a horse blanket.
Give me some sugar, baby.
Come on, boys!
Steady, now.
- What? What is it?
- This path will lead you to an unholy place.
A cemetery.
There the Necronomicon awaits.
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words:
"Klaatu, barada, nikto."
- Klaatu, barada, nikto. Okay.
- Well, repeat them.
- Klaatu, barada, nikto.
- Again!
I got it! I got it!
I know your damn words, all right?
Now, you get this straight,
the both of you!
If I get that book, you send me back.
After that, I'm history.
What is it, boy?
Come on!
Ramming speed!
Ready. Aim. Fire!
Shake a leg!
You lousy little...
Yeah! I'm gonna hunt down all you...
You little bastards! All right!
I'll crush each and every one of you.
I'll crush you to pieces, I'm telling you!
I'll squash you so hard,
you'll have to look up to see...
Hey, dumb ass!
Surf's up!
All together now!
Shit!
Quietly. Gently.
Easy, big fella. Easy.
"London Bridge is falling down
"Falling down, falling down"
"My fair lady"
Is he up? Is he?
What a horrible nightmare.
Wait a minute.
Oh, God!
I can't move!
Open wide!
Let's go!
Geronimo!
Let's go!
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate?
How'd you like the taste of that?
How'd you like the taste...
Dear God! It's growing bigger!
- Hey!
- Hey!
- What's the big idea...
- What's the big idea...
- Why, you...
- Why, you...
I'm blind. I'm blind.
Where are you taking me?
"Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me
"'Cause I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee"
What are you?
Are you me?
"What are you? Are you me?"
- You sound like a jerk!
- Why are you doing this?
You want to know?
Because the answer's easy.
I'm bad Ash. And you're good Ash.
You're goody little two-shoes.
You're goody little two-shoes.
I ain't that good.
Now you see what's what.
A man's body is his own personal property.
Don't let anybody try
and take that away from him.
That'll teach you. Yeah. That'll teach you.
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon.
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it.
Hey, what's that you got on your face?
- See how that works?
- I'll come back for you.
Come on, boy!
Come on!
Three books?
Wait a minute. Hold it.
Nobody said anything about three books.
That stinking Wiseman!
He was so busy filling me
with his secret words...
...and his phrases, and his bullshit,
that he never said anything about this.
Like what am I supposed to do?
Take one book, or all books, or what?
Wrong book.
Get outta here!
I'll get back to you.
Well...
...it seems fairly obvious.
Wait a minute. The words. Right.
Say the words.
Klaatu...
...barada...
Necktie.
Nectar.
Nickel.
Noodle. It's an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.
Definitely an "N" word!
Klaatu, barada...
Okay, then.
That's it.
Hey! Wait a minute.
Everything's cool. I said the word. I did!
No! Wait!
No!
You, people, seek cover! To the parapet!
Seek your children.
Steady the horses!
Something's wrong. Something's amiss.
Where'd you go?
I'll crush you!
I'll mash your faces, you bony creatures!
Keep your damn, filthy bones
out of my mouth.
Come on!
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part. Now I want back.
Like in the deal.
I...
...live...
...again!
There! The promised one!
The promised one's returned!
Raise the portcullis!
Truly, he is the promised one!
He's brought the Necronomicon.
- Hi.
- He's got the book!
Yeah, great.
Get the fuck out of my face.
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon?
- Yeah, it's just that...
- Just what?
Nothing. Here.
Now send me back. Like in the deal.
When you removed the Necronomicon
from the cradle, did you speak the words?
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words?
Look, maybe I didn't say every single,
little tiny syllable...
...but basically, I said 'em.
- Dung-eating fool!
Thou hast doomed us all.
When thou misspoke the words,
the army of the dead awoke.
Now, whoa, right there, spinach-chin.
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.
That there's a passage in there that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back.
But to us, it is useless! The evil has
a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon.
And it will come here to get it!
We had a deal.
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for you!
I did my part, now you send me back!
Very well.
As we are men of our word,
we shall honor our bargain.
The Wiseman shall return you
to your own time.
Yeah?
I thought he was the one.
Yeah, right, because that was the deal.
So when do you think we can start
with all the thing and the...
He's nothing but a traitor, he is!
When do you think we can start
with all the ceremony and the...
...you know, like, you know, because...
...sooner's always better than later, right?
- Wretched excuse for a man.
- The Wisemen were fools to trust in you.
- I knew he couldn't be trusted.
- I trusted him.
I still believe that thou wilt help us.
Sheila. Don't you get it? It's over.
I didn't have what it took.
So long.
You would leave me?
Cripes, I don't belong here.
I got a chance to go back, and I'm taking it.
But what of the things that we've shared?
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private?
Well, that's just what we call pillow talk,
baby. That's all.
It was more than that!
I still have faith in thee.
I still believe that thou wilt stay
and save us.
Coward.
- Help me!
- Sheila!
Hold your arms! You'll hit the girl.
My sword.
Damn you!
Dig, damn you!
Dig faster!
I shall command every worm-infested
son of a bitch that ever died in battle.
- Thank you, sir.
- You there!
Handsomely, now!
We shall storm their castle
and get my book.
Hoist, you damnable varlets!
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Now pick up a shovel and get digging!
Bring on the wench!
Get down there!
Give me some sugar, baby.
Now ain't you the sweet little thing?
Don't touch me, you foul thing!
Come on. That's it.
We got plans for you, girly-girl! Move!
Bust your bones, you dig up holes, dogs!
Get thee hence!
A scout approaches!
Get his horse!
Arise.
My Lord, an army of the dead gather
in the wilderness and approach the castle.
- How far from here?
- But two days ride.
- These winged ones are only the first.
- Perhaps we should leave soon.
- We'll be safe in the mountains.
- Yes. We must flee!
- It is written. It's been foretold.
- They'll take our souls.
- I'm afraid!
- Every one of our souls!
I don't want to die.
That's it! Go ahead and run!
Run home and cry to mama! Me?
I'm through running!
I say we stay here and fight it out.
Are all men from the future
loudmouth braggarts?
No. Just me, baby.
Just me.
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls?
How will you fight that? More words?
Most of our people have already fled.
We are but 60 men.
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.
Now! Who's with me?
I'll stand by you.
- You can count on my steel.
- I'll offer up my courage!
- Me sword's by your side!
- I'm with you!
I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
Hail! Hail! Hail!
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.
There's a sight for sore bones.
I may be bad, but I feel good.
- Who rules?
- It is you, my lord.
To the castle!
- But the men are afraid!
- It's too heavy! Now, that's enough.
Quit your bellyaching!
I know you're scared. We're all scared.
But that doesn't mean we're cowards.
We can take these Deadites,
we can take them!
With science.
Hurry up, now!
Come on, fellas! Push! Heave ho!
Tilt. Tilt.
Okay, in, in.
They're coming! The Deadites approach!
Quickly now, you worthless fools!
They'll be on us anon!
Come on, guys!
The moment of truth is almost here.
You men better not fail me now.
There's so damned many of them.
I need more men.
Battle stations! Get those rocks up!
On the double!
Ready the catapults!
By God, let's give them what for!
Halt!
- Looking glass!
- Aye, sire.
Once I possess the Necronomicon...
...I shall rule, and you shall be my queen.
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.
Fine. Where are they keeping my book?
There, my lord.
Beyond the drawbridge in the second wall.
That would be the safest place.
I will not allow anything to keep me
from possessing that Necronomicon.
Now, bring me forth into that castle.
- Forward!
- Forward!
Cry havoc, and let loose the dogs of war!
To the castle!
Excellent.
Death to the mortals!
Arrows!
Bows.
Load!
Draw!
Torch boy!
Steady.
Fire!
Advance, you demons! Advance!
Yeah, baby!
All right!
- Retreat!
- Let's get the hell out of here!
Damn him!
The sortie on the second flank will stand.
It must!
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.
Ram the gates!
Catapults!
Catapults! South!
- We'll crush them!
- We'll strike again!
Fire!
What the blazes?
- Watch out!
- Make way!
Seek cover!
You miserable bags of bones!
Pick yourselves up and sally for...
Sally for...
Sally forth.
Come on, you miserable wretches!
Forward!
Buttress that door! Now!
Rocks!
Damn you!
That's gotta hurt!
You cretins!
Arrows!
Fire!
We'll ram it down the bastard's throat!
Fire!
South flank, to the western wall! Now!
Where is Henry the Red?
I told you he would not come!
Keep your sardine can on, bucket-head!
I said he'll be here, he'll be here!
I think he will not. But know this.
No matter how this battle fares,
I was wrong to think you a coward.
We've broken through! The castle is ours!
Kill the mortals!
All right, men!
They've breached the first wall!
What next?
We are deserted!
Fall back! Man the parapet!
Protect the book!
God save us all.
Up the ladders, lads!
To the safety of the parapets!
Say hello to the 21st century.
Come on! I got plenty for everybody!
- How do you like this?
- Play dead!
It's the one in the cart we want. Get him!
Sayonara, sucker!
Why, you...
You can run, but you can't hide!
Sheila?
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.
- Excellent.
Now I will have that book.
Storm the walls!
Ladders!
Come on, you bony devils! Hurry up!
Or I'll send you to the glue factory!
Elmer!
To the walls!
I'll slice you to ribbons! No, no!
Wait! Look out!
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie!
- Get off of her!
Damn you!
Defend the Necronomicon, lads!
Or perish in the devil's fire!
- My lord.
- Stay with the book!
The book will be ours!
Hello!
The book is mine!
There you go!
I'll cut your gizzard out.
Where'd he go?
Come to Papa!
Get him!
Crazy bitch, get off me!
You're tearing my eyes out!
You witch!
Right.
You found me beautiful once.
Honey, you got real ugly.
There we are.
You wanna play rough?
All right!
You're going down!
- I'm going up!
- I'm coming for you!
Get him!
Excuse me!
Come on! All right!
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch!
No!
I'll spoil those good looks!
Backstabber!
Hold still!
Tallyho!
- We can't hold the battlements!
- We will hold! We must protect the book!
Where's Henry the Red? Why's he not...
We are deserted!
We're overwhelmed!
I got a bone to pick with you.
Come on!
I'll slice your gizzard open!
Now you're mine!
No!
Why, you...
Let go of the sword!
I'll cut your throat out if I get the chance.
I have the book!
I possess the Necronomicon!
I've crushed your pathetic army!
Now I'll have my vengeance!
The Red! The Red!
Duke Henry and his men have come!
For king and castle! Cry havoc!
Blows, blood, and death!
We are saved!
Onward, valiant cousins!
Their ranks are broke!
Bloody hell!
You've spoiled my plan for conquest!
And now you're going to die!
Buckle up, bonehead!
Because you're going for a ride!
Victory is ours!
- lf it's a fight you want...
- Well, start something!
- Stand ready, lads!
- We're ready for you!
Move yourself, lad.
- Your hand, man.
- Hey, Henry.
- The debt's paid.
- You had us going.
- Milady.
- Arthur.
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day!
We're brothers now!
A new kingdom shall be born!
The book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep for a century.
Swallow six drops,
thou shall awaken in thine own time.
God bless you, sire.
Six drops.
One, two, three, four...
...five.
Five.
Six.
I'm home.
Manufactured products!
God! No! No!
I slept too long!
