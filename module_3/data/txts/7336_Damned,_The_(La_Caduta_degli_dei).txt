<i>It all started with a secret.
We all have them.</i>
<i>Everyone's is different.</i>
<i>Most secrets don't carry much weight.</i>
<i>But some... some secrets can
destroy everything you love.</i>
Why?
Why, David?
Why?!
Are you watching the sunrise alone?
That's no fun.
No, I was just thinking.
- Are you getting cold feet?
- No.
No, I was just thinking how
lucky I am to have you.
Flattery will get you everywhere.
Do you want to go explore
the city while I find Jill?
No, I'd rather explore you.
We have a tradition, remember?
For every new stamp on the passport,
we need to leave our
mark on the country.
How many stamps do you have now?
Not nearly enough.
I am here today in the depressed area
of Ciudad Bolívar in Bogotá Colombia.
We Colombians are very aware of the difficult
situation these people face every day.
However today there is hope for
the future of Colombia. Our children.
Let's meet some of the people who
have volunteered for this project.
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
What is your name?
- Yeah, sure. Hi, my name is Jill.
- Are you from Medellín?
Actually I'm from the United States but I'm
spending my summer holidays in Medellín.
Tell me what brought you to
Medellín and then to Bogotá.
When I heard about this project
I wanted to help Bogotá,
which is the town
where my mom grew up.
Thank you so much on
behalf of all the Colombians.
- You're welcome.
- This is Gina Herrera...
reporting live from Ciudad Bolívar...
where we rely not only on
the effort of all Colombians,
but also on very important
international effort.
- That was so cheesy.
- What? What was cheesy?
- "International effort"?
- Well, what is it?
Why don't we interview the girls
who are actually from Medellín?
Why are we focusing
on this skinny "gringa"?
- Look, you can always be sexier. Always.
- Always with the "sexy".
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I love it.
- Do you want one?
- Yes, yes, yes.
Can I get two, please?
No, I'm not laughing at you. I swear.
I'll call you in ten minutes.
Dad!
How did you find me?
I pay your credit-card bills, remember?
I always know where you are.
David, what a surprise.
Gina, you didn't get any of my
voicemail messages, apparently.
Messages? No.
Lauren, this is Gina.
She was Marcela's sister.
- Well, I'm still her sister. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.
David's told me so much about Marcela.
It sounds like she was an amazing woman.
She was.
- You shouldn't have come, dad.
- You think we want to be here?
We have a wedding in eight days.
You're not missing that,
and you're definitely not gonna
miss your freshman year at...
Well, I'm not going home.
Jill, I'm not marrying
David without you there.
- Sure you're not.
- Jill.
- Okay, why don't we relax a little bit?
- Don't tell me to relax, Gina.
You're her aunt. You knew she was
supposed to be home a week ago.
- You could have put her on a plane.
- Okay, don't blame her.
Just grab your stuff.
We're flying out of Bogotá tonight.
No, we're not. My passport's
back at Gina's in Medellín.
- It's true.
- Of course it is.
How far is that?
Hey.
Like six-eight hours driving.
That doesn't sound very good.
Who is this?
Ramon. Raymond.
- My cameraman.
- And... my boyfriend.
That doesn't sound very good, either.
I understand you're angry, but whether
you like it or not, she's 18 now.
She's testing a little bit of independence.
Just give her some space. That's it.
I'll give her space after college.
She's such a great kid.
I just want to make sure I can keep
her close so I can keep an eye on her,
- make sure she's safe. That's all.
- Correct me if I'm wrong.
You went backpacking through Europe
when you were in college, right?
That's when you met Marcela?
Was that safe?
Why would she suddenly want to skip
the wedding? Has she said anything to you?
Yeah.
- And?
- And what?
- What did she say?
- Let's hear it.
Okay. You're on her Facebook as
"a gold-digging bitch marrying my dad."
Why the hell would she
say that? I mean...
No, no, no, no. I completely get it.
I'm not trying to replace Marcela,
and I never will.
Gina, make him stop.
- Why is he still with us?
- Relax a little bit, please. I told you.
He's my cameraman. He's a good guy.
He's just her summer boyfriend.
What's all the fuzz about? Of course,
that's what my sister said about you at first.
That's what I'm worried about. I don't
want her having babies at 18 like us.
Come on. She won't, believe me.
Okay, remember that trip to Vegas?
You and Marcela were taking shrooms.
You used to do that, right?
- No.
- Yeah, right.
- No, I wasn't.
- I bet you do.
And my sister went all crazy
about the park buses.
You know what? That's exactly what
Jill needs to keep her spirit alive.
She wants to talk about her.
She says you don't talk about
her anymore. It's important for her.
Gina, are you sure this road is safe?
Isn't Farc around here?
Farc? No, no. No,
we've gotten rid of most of them?
"Most"?
What the fuck happened?
- Sorry, sorry.
- Welcome to Colombia.
Gina, why don't you let... David drive
for a bit so you can have a rest?
- Do you want me to?
- I don't mind.
Okay.
Fancy wedding? Sounds like
business is going well. I'm glad.
Better to be the agency owner
than another photo journalist
slugging it through war zones.
- Have you seen his pictures?
- Yeah.
Your book was fantastic.
I mean, it's one of the best I've
ever seen in my life, I swear.
Your sister used to tell me I spent
too much time documenting
life and not enough time living it,
so I'm working on that.
- Good.
- I like your bracelet.
Really?
- Here. You can have it.
- Don't be silly.
It's a gift. At least you'll have
something to remember from my country.
Thank you.
There you go.
- Is it okay if I smoke?
- Give me one.
No, no, no, no.
No one's smoking, okay? Sorry.
And, Jill, please speak English so Lauren
and I can join in the conversation.
Oh, shit.
- Can you grab my passport out of my bag?
- Yeah.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- You can't drive through here.
Yes... Where is Connecticut?
- Medell... Medellín?
- What?
- Where are you going?
- Connecticut.
He asked where we're going,
not where we're from.
- We're going to Medellín, sir.
- This isn't the way to Medellín.
You'll only come across floods
and landslides on this road.
- What'd he say?
- Flash floods.
That's right. You need to get on the
main road, about 20 km kilometers back.
He wants us to turn around.
We're going to Medellín. We're running late.
Can't we just go straight?
- I'm not familiar with this road.
- That's not a good idea.
Okay. Okay. Okay, we'll turn around then.
Thank you very much.
- You'll be careful, right?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
You know what? He's wrong. He's wrong.
He's a local. I know this.
I know this road perfectly.
We should find the main road
like in about 10, 12 miles.
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. Let's go.
Why would you let Jill go
anywhere without her passport?
Now we might not make our flight.
- Where's the main road?
- It should be coming up.
You said that half an hour ago.
- Is there a map in the glove box?
- David! David, watch! D-David!
Jesus! It's okay. Everything's okay.
Shit. Come on.
- We're gonna have to get out and push.
- Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Lauren! You okay?
Jill!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You okay?
- Ramon?
- Come on.
We have to call an ambulance.
I'm okay.
I have no signal.
There's no signal here.
Here. Grab some warm
clothes and hold up, okay?
There's a path that leads
to a house. Come on!
Okay. Shit.
Okay, okay, everybody just stay calm,
all right? We're gonna get through this.
Shit.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Help.
- Hello?
- Help.
- We need help.
- Help!
- Help!
- Hello?
- Accident, please...
- The inn is closed.
No guests allowed. There's a
town nearby, you can walk there.
We can't walk.
It's okay. She... she won't
make it into town. She's hurt.
You have to let us in, please!
<i>Por favor!</i>
Help us.
Please, help us.
- Your daughter?
- Yes. <i>Sí mi hija</i>. This is my daughter.
This is my family. Please.
- Family?
- Yes. Please.
Please.
- Thank you.
<i>- Gracias</i>. Thank you. Come on.
Let's get you over to the couch.
Okay?
- Fuck.
- You okay?
Yeah.
Towels.
- Towels.
- Yes. Please.
I just have to take my jacket off.
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
Thank you, sir. Okay.
Thank you.
I'm David. This is my fiancé, Lauren.
Jill, Ramon, and Gina.
Felipe.
Ask him if he has a cellphone.
Do you have a phone or
a cellphone we can use?
There are no cellphones here.
No landline phones either.
How you holding up?
Oh, I'm great. It's been
a great holiday so far.
I know you're concerned, but I'm just gonna
do a self-exam and I'll let you know, okay?
You've got a cut on your eye.
I'll be okay. There goes
our wedding pictures, right?
Could I get a-a glass of water?
Could you bring us a
glass of water, please?
Thank you.
This doesn't protect you.
Guy's creepy. He just told me my
mom's rosary won't protect me.
- What do you mean?
- Thanks.
- Protect you from what?
- I don't know. That's what he told me.
Do you have any
wood for the fireplace?
- Wood, Felipe?
- Yes.
I can get it for you.
Don't leave. Everyone stay here.
He doesn't want us to go.
You go. I'll stay with Lauren.
Gallows Hill.
- Gallows Hill.
- What?
- This was a hotel.
- This was a hotel?
What's this?
The last guest registry is
from December 14th 1978.
Not a single guest in 30 years?
- Ramon.
- Look.
- This has been cut.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
That man didn't pay the phone bill,
so he just... cut it off.
It's probably just an old phone.
It's probably just an old phone.
You're right.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Wait. I really think we should
stick together. Don't leave.
- Lauren.
- Please.
I've been holding it since
the car, okay? I have to go.
- I'll stay with you, Lauren.
- Okay, hurry back, please.
I'll go with her.
- Would you mind if I have a look?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit. You should get
some x-rays right now.
They're only gonna tell me
that I've got two broken ribs.
- Are you sure? 'Cause it looks bad.
- I'm a nurse, Gina.
- I know what broken ribs feel like.
- Okay.
We should have listened
to the captain. This is...
So, you get a good look?
What?
Come on. I saw you
looking at my aunt's tits.
So now you want to speak English.
Okay.
Our car is wrecked.
Lauren is injured.
And we're trapped in a house...
with a psycho killer.
And you're worried that I
was admiring Gina's tits?
You love me.
Shut up, you moron.
Hey, I was thinking.
Maybe make sense for
you to go home now.
Be nice.
- Let him win this one.
- Be quiet.
Help me.
There's a little girl there. Come!
Listen.
We need to find her.
- Where are the others?
- They went to look for a bathroom.
I told you to stay here.
What is wrong with him?
- Where's Jill?
- She went looking for a bathroom.
Jill. I don't know about this.
Where are you?
Here. Here.
Mr. Felipe we don't
want to bother you...
we are actually very grateful
to you for letting us in.
I'm sure they'll be back soon.
We have to go down there.
Help me.
Ramon, come on.
What is this? A bathroom?
What the hell? Is he living here?
I don't like this, Jill.
Oh, my God.
Hello.
What is your name?
Ana Maria.
My name is Jill.
Who locked you in here Ana Maria?
Felipe?
Yes.
We are getting you out of here. Okay?
Stop right there!
- For God's sake. Stop.
- Calm down, calm down.
The Lord is with you.
If you touch her, you will die.
- We didn't see anything.
- What are you talk...
You've seen too much and
you know too much already.
You crazy fuck!
She's just a little girl!
What the hell you doing down here?
Why'd he have a gun on you?
Dad, he's got a little girl in there.
We have to get her out.
What?
Look.
- Point this at the lock.
- Okay.
Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
- Put her down.
- Who is she?
- Her name's Ana Maria.
- Felipe had her locked in the basement.
- What?
Oh, my God.
- What happened?
- He had a gun pointed at Jill.
- What? Are you okay?
- Yeah.
We should tie him up in the
other room. Give me a hand.
This is unbelievable.
I want to go to the basement.
Where's the camera, Ramon?
It's in the van.
- I need the camera anyway.
- Gina.
What? I'm gonna check the box, okay?
Gina, we don't know what else is
down there. We should stick together.
I'll be fine.
Check to see if he has a car.
- Automobile. You understand?
- Yeah, a car.
Jill, don't go far. I may need you.
I want to ask him some
questions when he wakes up.
I'm so sorry that this
has happened to you.
But we will take care of
you and get you help.
It's okay. It's okay.
Where is your mama?
Felipe.
Don't worry. I won't let him near you.
We can't leave yet,
but we'll find a way out of here.
You hungry? Okay. Gina! Jill?
Stay there.
Gina? Jill!
Mother of God... this is wrong.
This is where Ana Maria
was held captive.
It's a wooden box...
of about 9 feet wide and 5 feet high.
There's a very strong smell.
Here we have some inscriptions...
We don't know if Ana Maria
is the only one here.
We don't know if there's anybody else.
We don't know why.
What a hideous doll.
Fucking gross.
Ana Maria.
You fool! Idiot!
I told you I don't
speak Spanish. Jill!
- Now! When we still...
- I don't speak Spanish!
What'd you do to the little girl?
She becomes stronger every
time she's not in the box.
We still have a chance!
- You have no idea of who she is.
- Jill!
She's evil.
You have to help me take
her back to the box.
- Idiot.
- Jill, I need you now!
She's killed her family.
We're all going to die.
- What's he saying?
- He said we're all gonna die.
You're going to regret this, I swear.
If you don't untie me...
Ana Maria?
Ana Maria?
Ana Maria!
Open the door.
Ana Maria, I need you
to open the door.
Ana Maria!
Open your eyes, Dad.
Or I'll cut off your eyelids.
Leave those people alone.
But they're here to
protect me from you.
- Isn't that sweet.
- Take me instead.
Which one is stronger?
David or Ramón?
Shut up! Always praying.
Just like Inés.
She spent all day praying too
and that didn't help her.
I'm free again. Goodbye, Dad.
"Lead us not into temptation,
deliver us from evil".
Come on, come on!
Shit!
Ana Maria!
What are you doing there, sweetie?
Come with me.
- Has anyone seen Ana Maria?
- I thought she was with you. You okay?
Ramon is getting Felipe's car.
We're getting the hell out of here.
Why'd you take her outside?
She was there alone. I don't know why.
That's your doll, right?
Can you tell me her name? Do you want
me to ask her what happened down there?
Gina, what are you doing?
Trying to find out what the
hell happened down there.
What matters is that we get Lauren and Ana
Maria to the doctor, okay? Put that away.
Nobody's going anywhere.
- The old man's car is destroyed.
- Can it be fixed?
Felipe has to have some
kind of transportation.
I mean, he can't survive in the
middle of nowhere without one.
I'll get him talking.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
What was that?
God, forgive me.
- I-I-I...
- It's okay. It's okay.
David, look at his wrist.
He slashed his wrist
before he attacked us.
Dad? Dad, what's going on?
Why would he kill himself if he
was going to kill us, anyway?
And why would he kill himself
before attacking us? Why not after?
Besides he was coming right to us,
not you. You understand?
Leave me alone. Please,
stop talking about this. Stop!
Everything's gonna be okay.
Look, we need to get
Ana Maria to a doctor.
I have no idea how bad those
injuries might be, and...
So when... when the storm lets up,
leave us here and you and
Ramon need to hike into town.
What about you?
I'll be fine.
Look, if my dad has to push me
in a wheelchair down the aisle,
we are still getting married.
What's your doll's name?
Don't do that.
You have a strong body.
You've got to stop.
Okay. All right.
- Dad.
- Yeah?
I need you.
Dad, there's something
wrong with this place.
Why are all the phone lines cut?
What was he trying to hide?
What's he trying to hide?
That he's a pedophile, Jill.
I don't think that's it.
Look, that box looked like it hadn't
been opened in a long, long time.
How'd she stay alive in there?
Well, I guess he shoved food under it.
Where? It was sealed shut.
Okay. Let's take another
look at that box.
I find myself with the victim.
Ana Maria, tell us how long Felipe had
you locked in that box in the basement.
Gina. What are you doing?
I need her side of the story.
Okay, this is amazing, Lauren.
This is crazy. This might be
also healing for her, you know?
Ana, tell us how long
were you locked in.
She doesn't want to talk,
so stop filming her.
And don't bullshit me that
this might be therapeutic.
I'm gonna bring you
some more ice, okay?
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Anita. You almost gave me heart attack.
What are you doing here?
Honey, that cellphone is very expensive.
Don't play with it. Can I have it back?
Can I ask you a question?
Now you're going to ask me.
Are you going to interview me?
Okay, go ahead.
Who is Trevor?
He's my boss.
Did Ramon tell you about him?
Your boss is very handsome, right?
That's what they say. Yes.
Does he know that you killed his baby?
What did you say?
Just because it could
interfere with your success.
Trevor will be furious when
he knows what you did.
He won't agree with your decision.
- He'll call you a monster.
- Stop it!
Are you proud of yourself?
Your baby wants to know.
Answer, you selfish whore.
I've seen this symbol.
It's in Felipe's journal.
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.
It looks like some kind of language.
Ana Maria couldn't have
written that. It's too high.
That poor girl.
Let's get out of here.
Who is that?
Whoever it is,
they've been dead for a long time.
Some writing on it.
- It's in Spanish.
- Here.
"For my beautiful wife, Inés,
the love of my life. Felipe".
That was his wife. It says
she was the love of his life.
Then why did he kill her?
We think he's living down here.
Look at this.
- Is that Ana Maria?
- Looks like her.
1978?
- Dad, that's not possible.
- She'd be almost 40 years old now.
We need to talk to Ana Maria.
- David!
- Jesus.
- What the hell happened?
- Gina.
Is she okay?!
I just found them like this. Gina was
on the floor, and Ana Maria was dead.
- Ana Maria, listen to me. Ana Maria.
- Somebody slashed her throat.
- What... what happened?
- Gina.
Come on. Wake up.
What happened?! Who did this?!
- Someone's here in the house.
- You saw someone?
No, but I felt, like, an electric shock,
like a taser, and...
and I can't remember anything else.
Then you guys found me. That's all.
All right. From now on,
we stay together.
Storm will let up in the morning.
We'll leave then.
- No. We need to get out of here right now.
- We stay here, and we stay together.
I need to get out of here right now.
For all we know, Felipe could be
hiding an accomplice somewhere.
Gina's right, David. Look,
if there's someone else here...
No, it's better to stay in the house than
wander around in the storm outside.
- It's gonna get dark soon.
- Guys, I don't know.
All I know is that little girl scared the
shit out of me, okay? I'm glad she's dead.
How can you say that?
She was just an abused little girl.
You think so? Felipe didn't seem angry
when we let her out of the box.
He seemed terrified. And then he told
me that my rosary wouldn't protect me?
Protect me from what? And what about
those ancient markings inside the box?
- What did they mean?
- This is ridiculous.
Dad. Dad, come on. You saw that photo.
Doesn't take a box like that to
lock up an ordinary little girl.
- Isn't that right?
- What photo?
- What is this?
- Look at the date.
- That can't be her.
- Looks just like her.
This is impossible.
You've all lost your minds.
I don't know what's going on here,
but all this shit started happening
when we let Ana Maria out of the box.
All I care about now is getting
the five of us out of here safely,
so we leave in the morning. Here.
Keep an eye on them.
Make sure nothing else happens.
I'm gonna go take care
of Ana Maria's body.
Who did this to you?
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Okay, no, you know what? I won't stay
here doing nothing. Give me your cellphone.
- There's no signal.
- I'll find it.
- Hey. Where you going?
- I'm getting us out of here.
No, wait. Gina. Gina! You go with her.
Hey. You stay with me in case
there's someone in the house, okay?
- What? What's wrong?
- Dad. Dad, I saw someone outside.
Stay here.
- Stop! Stop right there.
- Jesus!
- Thank God it's you.
- Let go of the knife.
- You pulled us over on the road, remember?
- Let go of the knife!
- What?
- Let go of the knife!
- Listen, we got into an accident in our car.
- Where is Felipe?
- Our car. We had to walk here. What?
- Shut up! Where is Felipe?
- Felipe is...
- Inside. Let's go!
- My daughter! She speaks Spanish!
- Let's go!
- She can explain, okay? Okay, wait, wait.
- Go!
Felipe! Felipe, it's me,
Captain Morales.
Jill!
- Oh, my God.
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Let's go with him.
- Come on, come on.
Just explain to him
what happened, okay?
- Where is Felipe?
- Felipe is gone, Captain.
- What do you mean? Where did he go?
- He wants to know where Felipe is.
- Where is he?
- Okay! Wait!
- I'll show you.
- Let's go! Let's go. Go!
Move.
Quickly.
He had a little girl in a box.
He tried to attack us.
- Just tell him what happened!
- We can explain it.
He had her locked in the basement and
he attacked us when we let her out.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- Captain, he attacked us.
- You let her out?!
- That wasn't us!
To the basement right now!
Right now! Go or I shoot! Go!
Let's go! Quickly!
Open the door! Open the door!
Okay, get in. Get in. Get in, I say!
- Don't touch her!
- Stop right there.
Don't move. Everybody,
come on! Let's go.
- Do what he says.
- Let's go.
- Jesus.
- Quickly.
Go!
- Anything?
- Nothing.
- Where is the other woman?
- Gina? She left after the accident.
She looked for help!
- Go in. Go in.
- No.
Don't go anywhere. Listen to me.
You have to listen to us.
Why are you so scared? It's just us.
- Go. Go in! Go in! Go in!
- David!
Fuck! Fuck!
It's okay, let's go inside.
Let him go.
I am very cold.
Why don't you warm me up?
- Let's go downstairs.
- But why? Don't you feel like it?
Is there anyone else with you?
Why did you panic when
you saw Ana Maria's body?
- Answer her.
- After you go in the box,
- I will answer any questions you have.
- Like hell we're going in there.
Jill, take Lauren upstairs.
Find Gina and Ramon.
We're taking his truck and
getting out of here. Come on.
Let's go. Get in the box.
Come on. Now. In the box.
I know you're sad
about Felipe, I know...
but he's not the first
person you've killed.
You seduce them...
You make them fall in
love with you, right?
And when they're very much in love...
you fill their stomachs with drugs.
Get in.
Listen, you went in the box.
I trust you. Your family is in danger.
- Why?
- She's out.
Who? Felipe's daughter?
- She's dead.
- She is not dead.
- She's not even a little girl.
- What are you talking about?
Who was with Ana Maria when she died?
- Gina and Lauren.
- Where are they now?
What does that matter?
Because one of them is
not your family anymore.
How do you know that, Gina?
Because I know a lot of things.
I know you promise that
you won't hurt them...
but you will.
What is that symbol?
We don't have much time.
Please. Let me show you.
Do you remember Carla?
The one with pierced nipples.
When that capsule exploded
in her stomach...
the last thing she did before dying...
was cry your name.
Now you're shy.
Show me how you do it.
What do you want to put inside Jill?
Dad, I can't find them anywhere.
What is he doing here?
- The hand.
- It's okay.
It's the other woman.
You know you want to.
Make it stop. Please make it stop.
That's what Carla used to say.
Your pain is just starting.
David, you have to trust me if
you want your family to survive.
Gina.
Gina.
Stay away from me, Gina! Stay away!
Gina isn't here anymore.
Her name was Elena.
She was a <i>bruja</i>.
- A what?
- A witch.
The Spanish priests, they hung her
here in Gallows Hill in the 17th century.
30 years ago, Felipe found an old man
sealed away with those ancient symbols.
- He let him out.
- You said Elena was the witch.
She cannot be killed. If you kill her,
she will go inside of you.
When she went into his daughter,
Felipe built that box to hold her.
Felipe wrote down everything
he found out in that diary.
Whatever you do, do not listen to her.
She knows all your secrets.
She will use them against you.
We are too late.
The boy must have shot her.
- She's inside him now.
- You saying Ramon killed Gina?
Keep him away from your family.
She'll do anything to leave.
Oh, my God.
These all happened right before
the inn closed down in '78.
What does... what does this mean?
Auto-da-fé. It says here it's
the burning of the heretic.
The Spanish inquisition killed
thousands of innocents that way.
Apparently this one
wasn't so innocent.
Morales?
I'll never die, Morales.
Not even your children
we'll be safe from me.
A witch? Really, David?
- Look at all this research Felipe has done.
- What are all those names?
These are the same names that
are on the newspapers. Look.
Hernandez, Perez...
- Morales.
- Morales?
Like Captain Morales.
These are the descendants of those who
were responsible for the hanging of Elena.
The witch.
Open the door! Ramon is coming!
He's wounded!
Who are you? Why is your
name in Felipe's journal?!
My ancestor! He was priest
in the hanging of the <i>bruja</i>!
Please open the door!
She killed my father, David!
Come on! Please!
Jill, go to the kitchen and
get me some wet rags.
Yeah.
- Where's Ramon?
- I shot him in the leg to slow him down.
How do we make this stop?
She will not stop until
she kills every descendant.
She does not care about you.
You're just in the way.
You still have my car keys?
You take your family away from here.
She does not want you.
Only me. I am sorry.
This is all my fault.
I let her out of the box.
No, no. I am responsible for the witch.
You save your family.
Jill!
- Jill, it's me! Open up!
- Gina?
Oh, my God. Gina, you're alive?
Where have you been? What happened?
Open the door. I was hiding.
Ramon tried to kill me!
Open up!
Gina?
Open the fucking door, Jill!
Open the door, you little bitch.
Give me Morales.
Or I'll rip your fucking head off!
No!
- What are you doing? I had him.
- Saving your life.
You can't kill him. Come on!
Remember, you see Ramon,
it's not Ramon. It's the <i>bruja</i>.
You do not kill her. You wound her.
You slow her down.
You mustn't kill her, for your sake.
If you kill him, you die.
Come on.
Gina's dead.
Fuck!
- Bitch!
- Fuck you!
Jill, come on.
David, no! David!
It's me, Ramon! David, it's me!
You go get Morales.
I'll keep Ramon here.
He's not going anywhere.
I just handcuffed him to the truck.
You got him. Oh, my...
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- No!
- What are you doing?
Come on, David!
Come on!
David, see you soon.
We'll talk about what
you did to Marcela.
- Give me the keys.
- What are you doing?
Give me the handcuff keys.
Give me the keys! Please!
- David!
- Wait.
David, what are you doing?
He'll try to kill us again.
- Come on. Come on. Breathe!
- Why are you trying to save him?
The witch! If we kill her,
she somehow takes over your body!
What?
- Dad!
- Lauren!
Stay with me, baby! Stay with me!
Look! You have to fight it! Come on!
You're still in there. You can fight it.
Stay with me. Look at me! Lauren!
Come on! Don't leave me!
The rope! His rope!
Go get some rope! Quick!
Hurry!
Please. Please.
- Here.
- Get her feet.
It's all your fault, David. God is punishing
you and your family for what you did.
- Oh, my God.
- You killed her, David.
- Dad.
- Shut up!
Oh, he turned off mommy's machine
because she wouldn't die fast enough.
- Dad, what is she talking about?
- Shut up!
- Dad, did you do that?
- Help me, Jill. Please.
Is that true? I hate you!
- Jill!
- What?!
We need to get her back to the house.
It might be the only way to save her.
Please. Please.
Jill!
I need your help.
El Capitán. Did you miss me?
Elena is inside of her now.
We must take her back down to the box.
- For how long?
- Forever.
- No. No, there has to be another way.
- David, she's no longer Lauren anymore.
- You can't save her.
- He's lying. I can get her back.
You give me another body,
and I'll give you Lauren.
Felipe would have sacrificed
himself for Ana Maria.
Once the witch has your body,
you are dead. Think of your daughter.
Please, David. We must stop her now.
Come on.
Poor Lauren. Ugly and abused,
locked away.
You gonna give up on her
just like you did Marcela?
D-d-don't shoot!
- I should have shot her.
- No. You can't kill her.
You don't understand.
I shoot her, I die, she take my body.
- With no body...
- Without... without a host, she'll die?
Go. Bring her out. I kill her.
You... you and your daughter,
you... you'll be safe.
Go quick.
Okay. Hold. Come on.
You want me?! I'm right here!
Give yourself to me
and I'll let Jill live.
If I kill you, I give you my body,
you promise to let Jill live?
Yes.
I know all your secrets, David.
I'm not gonna kill you.
We'll see about that.
Jill, run!
Come on. Come on.
- David!
- To the basement. Let's go!
Come on.
She'll come down here. She has to.
Lauren's body is too weak.
She'll need one of us.
- It's not gonna be you.
- If we both grab her,
- then we can put her back.
- No, it's too dangerous.
You stay away from her.
I'll get her back in the box.
It's the only way to
destroy her. It'll be okay.
Jill, it's just a game, honey.
I'm not dead. Come upstairs.
My little puss-puss.
<i>Gatita.</i>
What?
Your mother used to call you
that when you were little.
You never told me that.
One day, you stood up on
this chair and you said...
"I am not a little kitty,
and my name is Jill."
- Really?
- Yeah.
David.
You can't hide from me.
She was... so...
passionate.
So strong. Remember?
I realized too late that's
why I fell in love with her.
She wasn't gonna get any better.
She knew it, too.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
You're a lot like her, you know?
Yeah?
David!
Listen, you have to hide, okay?
Promise me you won't come out
until after she's gone, okay?
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, <i>gatita</i>.
From the moment you were born.
Okay.
David.
I'm finished with this body, David.
And now I want yours.
Marcela?
No. No.
Shall I continue?
Don't. It's not you.
- More?
- It's not you. No.
It's not you!
Give yourself to me!
You are too weak to
put me back in the box!
I can't.
It's Marcela, baby.
Marcela.
Marcela. Marcela.
- Please.
- Marcela.
- Let me go.
- Marcela.
- Kill me again.
- I can't. I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
You are useless to me.
You have no idea what I'm
gonna do with your body.
You don't know all my secrets.
No!
No!
Dad, Dad, shut the door.
- Shut the door.
- What did you do?
Come on. Please. Please!
Just do it!
I love you, Daddy.
No, wait! What are you doing?!
- No, no! Dad!
- Listen to me.
- I won't leave you.
- You have to go!
No, you have to go! You have to go!
- I love you. I love you.
- I'm so scared, Dad.
No, dear God. Take me.
No, no. Jill. Jill. Jill.
No!
Take me.
Take me.
It was supposed to be me!
Don't leave me here to die. Like mom.
<i>It all started with a secret.</i>
<i>We all have them.</i>
<i>Everyone's is different.</i>
<i>Most secrets don't carry much weight.</i>
<i>But some...</i>
<i>some secrets can destroy
everything you love.</i>
<i>I'll bring Jill home.</i>
<i>I will not quit.</i>
<i>I will find a way.</i>
<i>I will get my daughter back.</i>
Daddy.
