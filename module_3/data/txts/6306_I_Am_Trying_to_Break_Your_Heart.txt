In some ways, they've made
their most ambitious record yet.
And ambition is not synonymous
with record sales.
You know?
I mean, this is not...
This is a masterful, dense,
artistic statement.
It could bomb.
I need more piano.
Less noise?
Less noise.
Yeah.
I could take less noise.
One, two, three.
# It's my father's voice
dreaming #
# Of sailors sailing off
in the morning #
# For the air-conditioned rooms
at the top of the stairs #
# His jaw's been broken #
# And his bandage is wrapped
too tight #
# His fangs have been pulled #
# And I really want to see you
tonight #
No. I'm sorry.
# I am an American
aquarium drinker #
# I assassin down the avenue #
# I'm hiding out
in the big city blinking #
# What was I thinking
when I let go of you? #
# Let's forget about
the tongue-tied lightning #
# Let's undress just like
cross-eyed strangers #
# This is not a joke,
so please stop smiling #
# What was I thinking
when I said it didn't hurt? #
# I want to crawl through
those brown eyes dreaming #
# Take you from the inside #
# Baby, hold on tight #
# Well, you were so right when
you said I've been drinking #
# What was I thinking
when we said good night? #
# I am trying
to break your heart #
# I am trying
to break your heart #
# But still I would be lying
if I said it wasn't easy #
# I am trying
to break your heart #
What are you doing?
"Hello!"
"Hello. "
"Welcome to our movie.
We are going to be seeing lots
of film about Wilco today. "
I've got to say
we're pretty lucky.
I think Wilco is in a position
where they can make the record
they want to make.
I mean, there is definitely...
I don't know
if I'd call it pressure,
but there's definitely
a feeling
that this is
sort of the moment.
"They are very funny guys. "
Give him a cigarette.
Oh, yeah. I got one.
I need a piece of gum.
I think...
and, of course, hope...
that this record is gonna be
a pretty big priority for Warner
when it comes out.
And... you don't get that
every time you put a record out.
"So, anyway, I was touring...
I was touring on the road
with Wilco. "
Oh, here's your gum back.
One, two...
# The cash machine #
# Is blue and green #
# For a hundred in twenties #
# And a small service fee #
# I can spend three dollars #
# And sixty-three cents #
# On Diet Coca-Cola #
# And unlit cigarettes #
# I wonder why we listen
to poets #
# When nobody gives a fuck #
# How hot and sorrowful #
# This machine begs for luck #
# All my lies
are always wishes #
# I know I would die
if I could come back new #
You know, there are two kinds
of potential.
There's artistic potential,
which I think for them
is unlimited,
and there is
commercial potential,
which is really
quite mysterious to us
because there are
so many factors
that are out of your control,
and we try not to think
about it too much and just...
try to make
a great record,
and hope and push the label
to make the right decisions
and do the right things
promotion-wise and so on.
This is an interactive band.
These are four or five people,
you know,
who make music together,
and the music wouldn't sound
the way it does
unless these five people are
together in the room
at the same time,
making the music.
It's a constant process.
I mean, we make records,
and they're, um...
Like, that ends up being
a thing that you're making,
and you have a million options
as to what that thing can be
and what shape it can be.
We generally go for a pretty
straight, definitive version
of what the song sounds like
it should be
and then deconstruct it
a little bit
and see if there's some more
exciting way to approach it.
# Echoes in my heart #
# And gravel in my palm #
There's no reason at all
not to destroy it.
You know?
We made it,
so it's ours to destroy,
and that's liberating
and exciting
in a really creative way.
# I need a camera #
# To my eye #
# To my eye #
# Reminding which lies
that I've been hiding #
# Which echoes belong #
# I'm counting on #
# Two days in Central Park #
# With gravel in my heart #
# And echoes in my palm #
# Phone my family #
# Tell 'em I'm lost
on the sidewalk #
# And no, it's not okay #
# I smashed a camera #
# I want to know why #
# To my eye #
# Reminding which lies
that I've been hiding #
# Which echoes belong #
# I'm counting on #
# Two days in Central Park #
# With echoes in my heart #
# And gravel in my palm #
I think this record's
more of a leap for the band.
This is probably the closest
to pure collaboration
Wilco has ever got.
Personally, I'm really happy
'cause Jeff and I have done
a lot of this stuff together.
This is the first time
that Jeff and I have made
a conscious effort
to get together at the loft
and write songs.
Not that things don't happen
spontaneously, um,
with the Wilco recordings,
but there is a lot
of conferring with each other,
a lot of deliberation,
a lot of, like Jeff was talking,
destroying what we've done,
trying it from the back door,
turning it upside down.
# I'm counting out #
# The days to see how far #
# I've driven in the dark #
# Echoes in my heart #
# Phone my family #
# Tell 'em I'm lost
on the sidewalk #
# No, it's not okay #
# No, it's not okay #
# No, it's not okay #
Uh, okay.
It's the first record
where we've really done
everything ourselves.
We're engineering it ourselves,
and we're doing it in our space.
We're doing two seemingly
contradictory things...
we're making a record
in a very relaxed environment
with no outside input,
but at the same time,
we're accepting
a certain kind of pressure
that we're putting
on ourselves.
It's nice not to have
a producer for Wilco
because we're all, any one
of us, perfectly capable of...
directing or shaping
a musical moment.
Everything is
just kind of set up
to just keep making records.
I know it's cool to bitch about
your record label, you know?
But, I mean, they're letting us
make a record in our loft,
and they haven't heard
a word of it.
They're giving us $85, 000,
and they haven't heard
a word of it.
You know, that's trust, right?
They trust us.
You're always playing the...
You're pretty much doing
1, 5, 6, 4 on all the...
A lot of times,
when you're playing,
if you don't have any, like,
sonic landscape behind you,
everything turns into
a folk song.
That's pretty much
what you do, right?
Yeah.
We just wanted it
to not sound like
a little folk ditty, you know?
So we wanted to have
just, like,
some kind of sonic weight
under all of that
and, uh, just something
kind of weird and fucked up.
# It's my father's voice
dreaming #
# Of sailors sailing off
in the morning #
# To fight the war #
That picks it up some.
# For the air-conditioned rooms
at the top of the stairs #
# They head to the table #
Tune the "A" string
to a "B" flat and it...
# And it makes
no difference to me #
And then you put them together
and you'll get
some really magical moments.
# They cried
all over overseas #
# And it's hot
in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
And we thought that might be
rhythmic enough to play to.
# There's bourbon on the breath
of the singer you love #
It's kind of along with
some of the more noise tracks,
but it's rhythmic,
so it's something
that they can play along to.
# He takes all his words #
# From the books
that you don't read anyway #
It was about 3:00
in the morning.
We were either gonna get
something great
or lose our fucking minds.
All these things are
just blaring in here, you know?
That's when it all
kind of exploded.
# They cried all over
overseas #
# And it makes no difference
to me #
# When it's hot
in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
# And it takes all the breath
out of me #
# When they cry all over
overseas #
# When it's hot
in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
# It's hot in the poor places
tonight #

Hey.
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.
Now, the Latin voice.
We're going to do something
with Jeff Tweedy,
who plays rock 'n' roll.
# One, two, three,
one, two, three #
# Gonna rock and... #
So, with the community
that you are doing now,
did you play music, uh...
porque...
Do you think
that your music, uh,
reaches out to children who
don't have a fighting chance?
Um...
# The rolling perfume
in the night #
# It's not even half as nice
as you #
# Set my sights
on one whispery kiss #
I'll sign that.
If you know how to spell
"Simón"... go for it.
S- I-M-O-N-E?
That sounds like right, yeah.
"Real pal"...
Do your record... My...
I have an idea.
Does it come out on...
compact disc?
M m-hmm.
# I dreamed about killing you
again last night #
# And it felt all right
to me #
# Dying on the banks
of Embarcadero skies #
# Sat and watched you bleed #
Let's just do a lot
of good crowd control tonight
and, you know, bring up
the whole political thing,
just fuckin'...
The whole thing
about women's rights,
lesbians' rights,
and stuff like that.
I'm gonna play to it.
I'm gonna play to the crowd.
Cool.
'Cause, you know, the Dow
is down about 30%, you know.
And as soon as I looked
at that,
I just knew what kind
of position you're in and stuff.
I've got to kiss some major ass
to, you know,
to get it...
my portfolio back together.
Totally. I know. I know.
I have...
I hear you, man. Totally.
I totally... I canned
my stockbroker two weeks ago.
How's the place
out in the Hamptons? Good?
M m, it's a fixer-upper.
I mean, the pool is shit.
Yeah.
Spielberg told me... He's like,
"I went over to Jeff's... "
'Cause he knows your fuckin'
music is a big bullshit thing...
and he was just like,
"I saw his fucking pool,"
you know, and he was just,
uh... he's funny.
You know, he reminds me
a lot of you.
You are stupid.
# Springtime comes #

That's, uh...
...one of the new songs...
...from our upcoming
Wilco record.
They sound nothing like that
on the record.
Poetry?
Are you saying
that my lyrics are poetry?
I like you.
Here's some more... poetry
for you.
I wanted to go out and
play some shows acoustically.
It seemed like the good time
to do it.
We haven't really toured
for a while.
The record's still being made.
And take a little break
from the record,
go play some music,
and see how things go.
# There are rows and rows

# With the light from the TV #

Jeff, do you remember Scott
from Reprise?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Hey, great job, man.
Well, thanks. Thanks.
You know my friend Sarah?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, excellent.
# In a sea #
# Black with ink #
Nice to meet you.
I work at WEA.
Jim.
That was great.
This is the whole
WEA contingent... M itch.
M itch? All right.
All WEA folks?
Not all of them.
Hoyt... Last Record Store,
Santa Rosa, California.
- Pushing Wilco all the way.
- All right.
# Try to fold it over #
# If I had a boat #
# I'd probably... #
# Roll over #
Hey, is the new record
more like...
Is it gonna be
more like "A. M.,"
or is it gonna be more like...
"Summer Teeth"?
Uh, it's really not
that much like
either one of those records,
I don't think, so...
Ooh. Really?
# Surely there is somebody #
# Who needs #
It sounded like it was
a trip-hop album or something.
There were tape loops
and samples and...
There are those things, but it's
not like a trip-hop record.
Tricky.
# I am so #
# I am so #
# Out of tune #
# I am so #
# Out of tune #
# With you #
I'm happy with it,
and we're almost done with it,
so, uh, you just have to wait
another month or so.
A month or two months.
And you guys are gonna tour
on that straightaway, then?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Well, hopefully it'll come out
in July.
It's, um...
it's got a lot of the drums
and holes...
and holes in the songs in it.
That's...
So you're like...
Is Courtney Love in there?
No.
Sorry.
A lot of big, open spaces
between what's supposed to be,
like... the music part.
I don't know. I'm gone.
# We all return #
# Music is my savior #
# I was maimed
by rock 'n ' roll #
# I got my name #
# From rock 'n ' roll #
Uh, it's Jeff.
Cool?
- Yeah, it seems fine.
- Great.
That's exactly the mix
you'll have out there.
# How can I convince you
it's me I don't like #
# And not be so indifferent
to the look in your eyes #
# When I've always been
distant #
# And I've always told lies
for love? #
# I know this isn't what
you were wanting me to say #
# How can I be closer
and get further away #
# From the truth that proves
it's beautiful to lie? #
# I've got reservations #
# About so many things #
# But not about you #
And then maybe...
Something... I don't know.
You know, it's...
Sure.
Yeah.
It's only a single.
It's the first time,
where he goes,
# I got a reservation... #
Yeah. Yeah, the first one is
the double one.
Okay.
I think
he's gonna stay away from...
What's that?
Uh, I guess the next...
four or five days.
Yeah. We're mixing.
I'm not at the loft.
I'm at the studio.
Tony's here.
# I... #
All right.
#... got a reservation #
All right.
Well, I'll call you later.
Pajama day?
This is, like,
this is the record
that needs to take the band
to another level.
If that didn't happen,
it would be a tragic sort
of missed opportunity
and that it would damage
the band.
I think every record I've
ever made, somebody has said,
"This is the big one. "
"You guys are gonna be huge. "
And when I saw the reality
of the situation,
I felt a little dumb
for believing it.
# Make no difference
ever known #
# Make no difference
ever known to me #
We do have a new A&R guy, M io,
who's really, like, younger
and cooler than our last guy.
So who knows?
Maybe he'll come in
and say something really cool.
Maybe he'll be great.
# I'm the man who loves you #
# I'm the man who loves you #
I think this sounds great.
Yeah. It's a song.
Do you want to hear
the new one again?
Can you guys tell me
what it is
about the drum sounds on this
that's not happening?
You said you can't get
a good snare sound?
You can't brighten them up.
I think that's
what's kind of cool about it.
They're murky-sounding,
you know?
- This is all you can get out of them.
- I think it's great.
If the overall song
feels good to you,
you're gonna fall in love
with the little parts of it
that are fucked up.
To sum up what I'm thinking...
- You can't change one piece of the puzzle.
- Right.
I don't think well-defined,
bright drums
with presence and definition
would serve the feel
of that song.
You know,
it's a $ 150-an-hour argument,
but that's okay.
Whatever they lack
I say are actually a virtue
in this cut.
If we go with this new one,
there is more redoing than...
Jeff thought before he left,
for instance.
What is coming up right now
is exactly what came up
when I first started talking
to Jeff about it,
which was, "I think this
does create a domino effect. "
Did anyone have any problem
with this song
- until last night when you tried to E. Q. The snare?
- Yes. Absolutely. Always.
Always since day one.
Maybe we should mix stuff
that we know is done.
There is no fucking pressure,
man.
This is day two in the studio
for this record.
- Three.
- Three. Okay.
There's still no pressure.
I just know if we mix
both of these,
we're gonna go,
"Neither one's it. "
I just know it.
I think it'd be great
if we just mixed
and leave all tracking
for the loft.
Honestly.
Jeff's on his way down.
Oh, his... Alert the media.
Has he...
Has he been... Was he alerted
to the situation?
No. He just called
for a status report.
Oh, and you said,
"Status not good. "
We had a little bit
of a work stoppage...
a grinding... grinding to
a halt, like, "Well, hold on.
What exactly... How are we
supposed to do this?"
It was like really readjusting
to how things are gonna work
when we're in
a different environment
from our luxurious...
little dreamworld.
We're spending $ 1, 000 a day
to be here.
Anytime we get stumped
from here on out,
we should just... move on.
That's what we're deciding.
I think we've all
kind of decided that.
Like, I don't want to
mix them both.
At the same time, I don't want
to get too hung up on this.
It's an important decision.
Oops. We happened to make it
the day we were here.
Or not make it.
You know, whatever.
Let's move on.
You know, we've spent $ 1, 000
in stupider ways in this band.
Like all that blow
in Amsterdam. That was...
Well, I must have missed out
on that.
There's more pressure on Jeff,
you know, externally
and self-imposed, I think.
He is aware that the success
or failure...
artistically, primarily,
of the record
reflects mostly on him.
Cut to the real mix
to "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
Why couldn't we do that
when we're mixing
"Heavy Metal Drummer"?
Well, why not do it now?
Because we got to go off-line,
unmute everything to find out
what track that thing's on.
Can't you just look and see
what track it comes up on?
Yeah.
But I don't know
if it's just one track or two
or what part
of the kit it is.
Okay, how would we do it...
How would we overlap it
mixing it separately?
We'd just say the orchestra
at the top of
"Heavy Metal Drummer" is there.
It wouldn't have to be a,
like, mastering thing?
Well, no, 'cause the orchestra
is in "Heavy Metal Drummer"...
in the top
of "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
But it seems...
That seems backwards to me.
Why not mix it
up to the cut point
instead of trying to mix
the other one
from a new starting point?
Why not mix it...
mix it to the edit?
Do you know what I mean?
Instead of, like,
making a new edit for the...
when we mix
"Heavy Metal Drummer. "
All right. I guess...
I- I... to me,
it's the exact...
There's...
It's the exact same thing.
You mix one up to here, or you
start the other mix here.
M ix, start.
Right there.
All right.
I didn't know
that you wanted it to sound
exactly like it does here.
I thought you wanted it to be
the noise going over
whatever was really on
"Heavy Metal Drummer" there.
I don't want the orchestra to go
into "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
It cuts right there.
Right. And I...
Okay, okay.
Let me try to explain myself.
Um... what I...
I didn't know that...
This is taking a lot longer
than doing one mute.
I know, but can I explain
myself, please?
I didn't know until now
that you wanted it to start
with a little kit...
Big kit.
Well, we can do it both ways.
No, I don't...
I don't give a shit.
You just... I just...
You misunderstood
what I was saying.
I- I assumed, apparently wrong,
that it was noise
until "Heavy Metal Drummer"
started.
But now I understand
that it's orchestra
until a subset of
"Heavy Metal Drummer" starts,
then, two measures later,
"Heavy Metal Drummer"
really starts, right?
- Sure.
- Okay. I didn't know that.
I thought we were just saying,
"Hey, that would be cool
if the noise went right up to
'Heavy Metal Drummer. "'
Does that make sense?
Well, whatever.
I don't know.
I don't know
what the problem is.
I don't.
I just want you to understand
me, like understand...
Why is that so important?
I don't have to understand you
all the time.
It's okay.
Like, we found it, and...
and we can do it.
Okay.
It... It seems to me
like you're making a-a big deal
out of not wanting...
Not wanting to... Okay.
I've just been sitting here
trying...
I've been listening to you
explain yourself.
And do you understand it?
Sure. I understand it.
Why couldn't you just say,
"I understand
what you're saying"?
I did.
Two seconds ago, you said,
"Why is it so important
that I understand you?"
Well, because it doesn't seem
like you were gonna let me
understand you.
You were gonna have to
explain it to me
again and again and again.

I threw up...
I used to throw up

for dehydration.

That feels better.
You're right. It's six of one,
half-dozen of the other.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I-I guess
I wasn't explaining myself...
See, now we have to do
all our outro mutes
on everything else.
Why?
Well, because we have
a bunch of other things open.
I mean, it just cuts
right there.
No, but up to there.
You know what I mean?
- Oh, right.
- Up to there.
Well, we would have had to
do that anyway.
Yeah, some of that
we would have, yeah.
But I was... I was... Yeah.
I was just thinking it'd be...
We'd just start
"Heavy Metal Drummer" that way
was what I was thinking,
you know?
I'm cool. It's...
I'm totally cool, all right?
It's over.
Right now, um,
Reprise Records is in
a pretty serious state of flux,
which I'm a bit nervous about.
I mean, I'm not worried about
the record not coming out.
The record will come out,
but you don't know
whether we're gonna be getting
the... same sort of enthusiasm
out of whoever
the replacement person is.
It's just a mystery.
What about "M ust be High"
or "Casino Queen"?
Nah.
I'm just thinking
in terms of rockers, man.
Yeah.
If we got easy rockers,
we should probably...
I don't want to
do that anymore, man.
You don't want to rock?
No, I don't want to
just fall back
on a bunch of easy rockers.
No, I'm just thinking
with four days to practice
and four shows.

I'd go either way.
When this record ended up
being finished,
it actually felt fresher to me
than it had felt for months.
After... We did a bulk of
the recording in a, you know,
over a year or so,
and somewhere towards the end
of that year,
it got to be
kind of nit-picking
and going back
and retracking songs
and knowing exactly what we were
going for... less exploratory.
And... And that was starting
to get kind of rough
by the time we went to CRC
to mix.
We got bogged down
in certain things
like, um, redoing drums or,
you know,
certain calls that were good
that helped us later on.
But for whatever reason, it...
it just bogged down.
Doing the record...
the final mixes... at Soma
and hearing them
through Jim O'Rourke's ears,
actually hearing it
with someone
who is coming at it
with some fresh perspective
and being able to collaborate
on the final mix
is kind of like...
Well, we're kind of throwing
everything out the window,
but we're also
kind of getting back
to what the original thing was.
When it went to Jim
with completely fresh ears,
he heard them
a little differently,
and right away, as soon as we
heard how he was mixing...
like "Trying to Break
Your Heart,"
the first thing he mixed,
then it was like,
"Oh. This really works. "
That's why
bands don't mix records.
Definitely it was like a...
It was a final stage
of collaboration.
Like mixing the record...
That's what I always felt like
mixing should be...
like it should be the last stage
of, uh, of inspiration.
I think we tried to
make it powerful,
like with two guitars.
Can you beef up your tone
a little, then, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay.
This is so steady now.
Yeah. I thought it was
feeling great, man.
God, I thought it felt great.
No, I mean, we can try
the two guitars again
if it feels too weak.
I just think that we've tried
the two...
I think the two-guitars thing
is, like...
M ight be obsolete, you know?
Uh, I'm not sure what
that means, but I'll try.
No, I just...
It's just that it was...
What's that?
That felt great to me.
That's all.
It just felt fuckin' rockin',
you know?
That's all.
# Jesus, don't cry #
# You can rely on me, honey #
# You can combine
anything you want #
# I'll be around #
# You were right
about the stars #
# Each one is a setting sun #
# Tall buildings shake #
# Voices escape singing sad,
sad songs #
# Tuned to chords #
# Strung down your cheeks #
We actually officially
delivered the record...
or sent them the final mixes
of the record.
I must have had 50,
60 definite possibilities
for magazine features, let alone
television appearances,
which were starting...
Offers were coming in.
And I just thought like, "Boy,
this is gonna be so great,
you know, it's all set. "
I think the press has always
loved Wilco,
but now we're gonna take it
even to another level.
When we delivered
the record, though,
we didn't hear from them
for like two weeks, you know?
So we... we thought that was
probably not a good thing.
I knew that I was sitting
on something
that people were gonna
beat down the door to get.
And then the advances
didn't get made.
So June is rolling along,
and I'm going like,
"Well, we're losing time,
"we're losing... we're losing
people to deadlines.
"They're not gonna be able to
cover this record
if we don't hurry up. "
And then,
about the third week in June,
I'd heard, "There's a problem. "
Next thing I heard was that...
they asked us to change
the record.
I don't know how they...
what they wanted us to change.
And Tony told me that...
that was their response,
and... and I told Tony
that we weren't interested
in changing the record.
Their A&R representative
was M io Vuchovich,
and what I had heard...
Like I said,
I never talked to Wilco about
the way this chain happened,
but what I heard from my side
was that M io had some ideas
about changes to the record
or additional recording
or mixing or things like that,
and the band had felt like,
"That's the record.
We're finished, " you know?
"We're not really in the mind
to make changes,
and it's sort of
a take it or leave it. "
And I think it went up
to M io's boss, David Kahne,
the head of A&R
for Warner's and Reprise,
felt like M io was right
and that changes
did need to be made,
and if the band wasn't
interested in making them,
then they should probably be
on another label.
Next thing I heard
was that they wanted to know
if we wanted to leave.
Well, I just think we've been
jerked around so many times
and that this is the ultimate
jerking-around.
You know, like this
"We're gonna drop you" shit
or whatever it is or
"You can get out of the deal. "
Either way you want to look
at it, it's still...
majorly being jerked around,
and... you know,
why should I think that things
are gonna change?
Actually,
when Tony first told me
that this was a possibility...
I have to be completely
honest... it hurt my feelings.
It's like a feeling
of rejection.
It's got to be more than some
sort of promise of, you know,
"We love you and we're going to
take care of you. "
Do you know what I mean?
Because we've heard
all that before,
and I just think that the wound
from this episode
of making this record,
delivering the record,
and getting, basically,
nothing but headaches in return
is pretty deep and gonna be
pretty tough to heal,
and you're not just dealing...
you know,
I'm not the only person
you've got to make feel good.
We never got too specific
about what exactly, uh,
made them hate it.
Okay, but I just want you...
I want you to understand
one thing.
This is really important.
Right now I believe that
the best thing for the band...
for the band... the present
and future of the band...
is to be away
from Reprise Records.
It was at a weird time
in the Reprise inner circle
because Howie Klein,
who had been president
of Reprise for a long time...
since Reprise was
reactivated...
he'd also been at Sire
when Uncle Tupelo was on Sire
and a big fan of the band...
had just left the label.
In fact, I think the day that
the band turned in the record...
the end of June...
right around then, he...
that was his last day.
A day or two after I retired,
I got a phone call
from one of Wilco's many,
many, many, many fans
at Warner Brothers...
and that was the first
of many phone calls I got...
telling me that Wilco
was dropped.
I would guess that if I was an
executive at a record company...
high-up executive.
I don't mean the people working
in the trenches,
but I mean the guys with,
you know,
the gold-plated cellphones,
you know?
If I was up there and I listened
to "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"
I probably wouldn't get it.
Why don't I get it?
Because it doesn't tell me
exactly who it's for,
it doesn't tell me
exactly what it's about,
and it doesn't tell me
exactly how much it will sell.
From what I gather, I think
that they didn't even think
there was a single to work on.
There's pretty stuff in there,
there's hard stuff in there,
there's mystery in there,
there's...
there's really sweet... tunes.
And there's, you know,
an abrasion in there as well.
But it's all there,
and you really have to
kind of sit with it.
You have to allow yourself
the time
to get something out of it.
There's no chance that Wilco
would have ever been dropped
when I was president
of Reprise Records.
We're now in a... a culture...
not just a business,
but a culture...
in which we expect
everything to happen
Like that.
You know,
you have people outside,
standing around
talking on cellphones.
You know, the gist
of the conversation is,
"I'll be there
in five minutes. "
Who gives a fuck?
Just be there in five minutes.
Don't talk about it.
You know, it's... You get...
People are just so impatient,
and as a result, you know,
we're looking at things
in ways like,
"Well, how much time do I have
to devote to this?"
And it's really sad because,
you know, music, art,
literature, poetry, you know,
even great technical...
technological inventions...
they're not meant to be
Done and done with
that quickly.
It was, like,
kind of just a shock
to be, like,
slapped in the face with, um...
um...
this calculated world
of... international,
multinational... whatever...
corporation.

I see a band here that is
really ambitious artistically.
It's not a VH1
"Behind the Music" story.
It's not a drugs-groupies-
celebrity kind of story at all.
This band's story is
the music.
Twenty years from now,
they're probably gonna get more
of their due than they are now.
I don't think they're a band
that fits in
with a lot of what music
gets played on the radio.
The appreciation for its
records is going to increase
as time goes on.
In the making of this record,
I felt like I got no support...
zero.
Emotional, financial...
whatever.
Then, at some point
in the process,
you start asking yourself, "Why
are we... What are they doing?"
We don't need the money.
You know, the band can go out
and play gigs
and make the money
to pay for the records, so...
They're not getting the band
on the radio.
Um... you know, it's really...
at this point, to me,
their value is really,
really questionable to us.

Good to see you, brother.
Aw.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
They won't let you
just do it yourselves?
Hoarding it, pig.
I'm stealing the band's pizza.
Oh, I got busted!
I'm sorry, dude.
- Is that cool? Is it cool?
- Does anybody have a pen?
I don't have nothing
for you to sign!
Tell him to sign your ass.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I can do that.
You'll have to sign my boobs.
Actually... Would I?
I don't know.
I've never...
Someone in our band
did that once, actually.
You can sign my ass.
I have nothing else to sign.
- Really?
- Do you wanna?
If you sign her ass,
you have to sign my ass.
And if you sign her ass,
you have to sign my ass.
You can sign my chest.
That's what Jimmy...
Oh, we saw Jimmy in the, uh...
- Are we on the lighting stage?
- Sound check.
...with Straitjackets
in the elevator last night.
Remember the guy
who sat in...
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Jimmy Lester?
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This is a...
I met Bob from
"Sesame Street" yesterday...
last night.
- Bob?
- Oh.
Do you know Bob?
Does anybody know who Bob is?
- Yeah.
- I can't remember that.
- How'd you meet him?
- He was in our hotel.
He's doing a kids' show
right now as we speak.
Oh, man.
He's like, "Yeah, I got...
Big Bird's coming in tomorrow,
and we're... "
There's Jay right now
as we speak.
So also, although
it's already been blown,
but J. P. Asked if we could
sort of steer clear
of the stage
for a little while.
Until...
Until sound check is over?
Until Jay gets, uh, done?
Has Jay been here since
like 6:00 in the morning?
Gentlemen, we have about
35 minutes to do all of this.
Yeah, we're going Glenn,
we're gonna go... Jay Bennett,
the entire keyboard world
and Jay Bennett electric rig.
Keep him there.
After Jay,
we'll do Johnny real quick,
M r. Tweedy, let Leroy get
his world sussed out.
We're only gonna have time
to do about two songs.
Check. Hey, hey, hey.
Yeah, the delay's not working.

Let's talk about Jay.
All right. I probably
won't have much to say.
- Okay.
- Just warning you.
Okay.
It's my understanding, from
what I heard in the grapevine,
that that was sort of
an amicable separation
and that, um, I...
And I don't know
that this is true,
but the hearsay is sort of
that he didn't feel
that he had had as much
a role in the songwriting
as he wanted to have or, uh...
I think that there's
some truth to that,
and I think
there's an effort...
there's an effort made
for it to be amicable.
Since Jeff's solo tour
and Glenn joining the band,
uh, some dynamics
in the band had altered
in... many different ways.
I think Jay's contribution
to the band over time
and our collaboration
was important
and was valued in the band.
As for the circumstances
surrounding him leaving,
I really think that that's
up to Jay to define.
And as far as my, uh,
feelings about it,
I couldn't be happier.
Jeff was convinced
that he really needed to
tell Jay directly
and he needed to be the guy
to do it.
We sat down, and he said,
"I don't think I can make music
with you anymore. "
And I said, "Why?"
And, uh...
I'm not sure I ever got
an answer that made any sense.
Jay wore out his welcome
in a lot of ways.
It's hard to be working
with somebody, uh...
that... that needs more
than you can...
than you can give him.
And, um, you know,
I'm more interested in being...
playing music with people
that I can share with
than give things to.
Jeff was threatened by me.
It's clear.
By the attention
I was beginning to get.
Um...
He wanted the band back.
That's simple.
That's a simple answer.
You know, Jeff went into
this big, long analogy
about how a circle needs
a center, you know?
Well, he was gonna be
the center, right?
I wasn't gonna be the center.
It's hard for me to talk about.
Um, I mean, I've known Jay
for... 16 years?
17 years?
And... our friendship had, uh...
run its course.
There's a lot of power-related
issues in Wilco,
and people are...
They don't want to lose
their gig, man.
And so they don't want to
step outside
of their little, uh, um...
uh... scripted role.
'Cause if they do,
this is what happens.
I think we all knew everyone
would be happier in the end,
and I think Jay would
totally agree with that.
It did not come
as a total shock to me
to be asked to leave Wilco.
It had been
in the back of my mind.
In fact, I'd talked to Leroy
about this extensively...
that, to quote myself, "My days
in Wilco are numbered. "
I had thought very,
very seriously
about leaving the band.
I just happened to be beaten
to the punch.
When you're Jay Bennett or
whomever and you leave the band,
you have to kind of start over.
You're going back to playing
for 35 people
or 100 people or whatever
from sold-out theaters.

They delivered a great record,
and I think
it's a record company that,
for whatever reason,
can't handle
that type of great record.
And so, fantastic.
Let's go do something else.
I don't know how to make
I don't know how to make
something other than
the record we made,
and I think to entertain
any of their half-assed,
fearful, frightened bullshit
would be to compromise something
that is a big part of my soul.
You know?
Like, it's a part of my heart.
And I don't have any interest
in doing that anymore.
I think it's a really, really,
really strong record.
I think it's a statement.
I think it's the right record
for them to make...
now in their career.
And I think there are dozens
of labels
that would be ecstatic
to have it
and who, if you delivered
this record,
would call you up and,
you know, be excited about it.
That's all.
You know, that's what I'm tired
of is, like, no enthusiasm.
Why is Wilco dropped, uh,
24 hours after they deliver
a record like
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"?
Um... I mean,
we've contemplated that question
at great length
over the summer,
and in the end,
I think Tony and I both
just sort of put our hands up
and said, "I guess we're glad
that it just happened,
"and we won't try to
overintellectualize it
any further. "
But I really think,
looking back on it,
it's because of marketing.
And it's because you have
an artist like Jeff Tweedy
who's put out, uh, you know,
four or five records in a row
with a record company
and they haven't been able to
bring sales up to a level
where it's really significantly
affecting their bottom line.
They, uh, I guess,
stop thinking about it
from a pure artistic level
and just say, "We don't
make money on this guy. "
And then he delivers a record
which, for whatever reasons,
they evaluate
as being difficult to raise
to the next level
of public appeal,
so they say, "Well, okay,
we're not going to... "
I guess, to use a phrase...
"throw good money after bad.
"We've spent $ 200, 000
recording this record,
"but it's gonna cost us
another $300, 000 or whatever
"to launch a marketing campaign
for it,
and we just don't think we're
gonna make our money back. "
So they drop the artist.
Um, this, of course,
creates a situation for us
where we have a finished record
and we want to put it out.
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"
has actually turned into
a kind of metaphor.
It's now a measure
of what record companies...
or not even so much
record companies,
but the corporations
that own record companies...
are willing to put up with.
Ultimately,
what it came down to
was they had told Jeff Tweedy,
"We don't like your album.
We don't want to release it. "
In the end, you know,
it doesn't really matter
who puts the record out.
Eventually,
either in the near future
or in the way-far,
distant future,
someone's gonna get it.
As long as music is available,
someone will hear it.
The record label must have
found it to be
something of
a public-relations problem,
because the press really
latched on to the situation
as something of a...
using Jeff as a poster boy
as to what problems
were going on
in a lot of record companies...
and in particular
Warner Brothers...
with their artist rosters.
And they didn't want it to
blow up any further than it did.
So they, um,
after a certain amount of, uh,
anxiety-ridden conversations,
said, "We think
the right thing to do
"is let you take your record
somewhere else...
wherever you'd like. "
Every time we put out a record,
the length of time that
a record company is willing
to actually even, uh,
humor you
about, like,
working on your record
has gotten shorter.
Music is not limited to what
happens in a business quarter.
And...
You know...
this is a record, okay?
This is something that,
probably, someone will buy.
They'll pay, 15, 16...
whatever... bucks for it.
And that's cool, but, you know,
what's encoded somewhere
in the bottom of this thing...
this dopey little disc...
you know, that's what matters.
This... the artifact,
the actual object... is not.
What's encoded in here,
if it's any good...
you know, you'll hear it.
And you'll either get it
or you won't,
and just as... as a...
as a writer, as a fan,
as a guy who just listens
to music a lot...
you know,
if you don't get it...
you know, I just think
that's kind of too bad.
# There's a magazine

"Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot" has been finished now
for about six months.
The band have done a little bit
of touring, um...
word got out that the band
were out of their deal,
and we started getting
a lot of calls,
um, and basically started
talking to people.
I think we were dealing with
about...
25 or 30 labels initially,
and then, as time passed,
we have been whittling
the list down,
and we're now talking
to five or so
and hope to have that resolved
in the next week or two.
I don't have any money.
I don't have very much.
Oh! I only have $6.
You want something to eat,
Sammy?
Yes.
I want something to eat.
What do you want?
Soda.
Soda.
Honey, I don't have
enough money.
I know.
I'll go get some money.
Never in my wildest,
most optimistic moment
did I think
that we'd be sitting here
in the position we're in
right now,
which is with
a finished record
that... is ours to take
wherever we want.
You could certainly say
that they fucked up
by letting the band go
and walk away with a record.
It's really an opportunity
that maybe comes along
once in a career.
The claw machine
ripped him off.
It wouldn't play?
No, it... it went by itself.
Tony, smell Sam's butt.
No, thanks.
I need to know if he needs
a diaper.
I think he does.
I was surprised at
the number of record companies
that were willing to pay
a large amount of money
to be sort of in
the Wilco picture.
# Oh, yeah #
Recognize it?
What is it?
- Guess. It's one of your songs.
- It's one of my songs?
"I'm Trying to Break
Your Heart"?
No.
Uh, "I Need a Camera"?
No.
- "Dreamer in my Dreams"?
- No.
No?
- "Casino Queen"?
- Unh-unh.
- "California Stars"?
- No.
Tell me.
It's something
with a drum in it.
"Heavy Metal Drummer. "
Yes!
How's that go?
# I sincerely miss
those heavy metal bands #
# I used to go see
on the landing in the summer #
# She fell in love
with the drummer #
# She fell in love
with the drummer #
# She fell in love #
# Shiny, shiny pants
and bleached-blond hair #
# A double kick drum
by the river in the summer #
# She fell in love
with the drummer #
# Another, then another #
# She fell in love #
# I miss the innocence
I've known #
# Playing Kiss covers,
beautiful and stoned #
# Unlock my body
and move myself to dance #
# Into warm liquid,
flowing, blowing glass #
# Classical music blasting
masks the ringing in my ears #
The record had started to leak
a little bit
from labels and so on,
and copies were starting
to float around.
And initially
we tried to slow it down...
we knew we couldn't stop it...
and then, at some point,
I think we just decided,
"You know what? It's out there.
"Let's embrace it
and make it available
through our website
if people want to hear it. "
A lot of people were
really aware of the new songs,
to the point where, I think,
a lot of people,
in the front rows, at least,
knew all the words.

After months of...
discussions and ruminations,
we have decided to sign...
The band's gonna sign
to Nonesuch records.
We've agreed
to all the major terms,
so the record will come out
on Nonesuch in April.
I do find it ironic
and a little humorous
that Time Warner is
the parent company
of both of these labels...
Reprise and Nonesuch.
- Are you Jeff?
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
One way to put
the reason for picking Nonesuch
is that they were
the best combination
of sort of the business deal
and a creative home.
In hearing the record, you know,
in the first 30 seconds,
I felt that there was something
going on with this record
that I hadn't heard
in a Wilco record before
and that it, you know, was...
it sounded brave to me.
Um, you know, it may have been
the same 30 seconds
that convinced Reprise
that they didn't want to
put out the record.
Okay, you ready
to start signing things?
M m-hmm.
Yeah, it looks good.
Hold on.
One more.
This is to get paid.
Definitely sign that one.
And I sign here.
You sign there.
And you're back in the fire.
Thanks.
It's a deal.

We're about two months
away from the record coming out.
The advances are here.
Jeff is in town doing press.
He goes to Europe next week
to do press.
It all begins now.
# Be not so fearful #
# Be not so frail #
# Someone watches you #
# You will not leave
the rails #
What are we, almost
eight months or nine months
since the record was originally
planned to come out
on another label?
So it's been a long road,
but it's the beginning.
# Be not so fearful,
be not so pale #
# Be not so sorry
for what you've done #
# You must forget them now #
# It's done #
We're...
couldn't be more excited
about the long-term prospects
of being able to work
with this band.
# And when you wake up you will
find that you can run #
# Be not so sorry
for what you've done #
It's a long road to here,
but, you know,
it's a new chapter now,
and, uh, we're, um...
couldn't be more optimistic.

That's the coup.
That's like the coup
of all time for us.
To basically get, you know,
one of the biggest
entertainment corporations
in the world
to release us from a contract
essentially scot-free
with a record that they had
already paid for
and then sell it back to them
for three times the money.
They just liked the record
so much
that they paid for it twice.
Hold your breath.
Make a wish.
Count to three.
