And the murdered woman,
she was the boy's
stepmother?
His father's wife.
And his brother,
who was always jealous of him,
led their father
to see what was going on.
But the Duke was anyway
tired of his wife.
She was very greedy
for money
as well as young lovers.
You have some
charming ancestors.
I don't know what
these rooms were for,
or who used them.
My grandfather,
the old Prince, used to say
that a house of which
one knows every room
is not worth living in.
The last member
of the family to live here
was my uncle, Alfonso.
He had to move out
because he was
being poisoned.
Not by a person,
but by bits of gold leaf
falling from the ceiling
into his coffee cup.
It was found
to contain arsenic.
Come.
This is how
they spent the money
that might have come to me.
One of the princes
from the last centuries
spent everything he had
on staging comedia,
in which
he always starred.
It would take Mr. Verver's
millions to fix this up.
Fortunately, he has them.
Yes.
Are you really going
to Baden-Baden?
Why on earth
Baden-Baden?
Because some kind people
kindly asked me.
I wish I could go home.
But you can't stand
America
for more
than five minutes.
It has the merit of being
very far away from you...
and your fiancée.
You know what I'd
really like for you?
You'd like me
to get married too.
What sort of person
do you have in mind for me?
Someone good and
kind and clever...
and rich.
Will you help me find
this magnificent husband?
Someone to make me
forget you?
Oh, Charlotte.
No, there is no choice.
I have no money.
I don't care.
Please don't do this.
Charlotte.
Charlotte.
Charlotte.
Charlotte!
I can't believe it.
Fanny, it's too good
to be true.
Charlotte is here
in London?
When did she come?
I thought
she was in Baden.
And she's with you
at this very moment?
But I have to see her
at once.
Fanny, dearest,
please.
Of course.
I insist.
Thank you, dearest,
bless you.
It's too wonderful!
Charlotte has come
for our wedding.
Amerigo,
you'll meet Charlotte.
I always liked Charlotte.
Of all your friends in school,
I thought she was
the best for you.
Imagine, here was
this splendid, noble girl
who knew every language and
every country in the world,
and here was this creeping
little American thing,
terrified
out of my wits.
She made me
her friend.
What are you
looking at?
Something unique.
It's a very handsome present
from our bridegroom.
It's interesting for me
because it shows
the ancestor
after whom I'm named-
Amerigo.
This Amerigo sailed
in the wake of Columbus,
and somehow managed it
that the new continent
was named after him,
not poor old Columbus.
And ever since,
in every
generation,
one son
in the family
is called Amerigo.
Amerigo.
Now you must do
something for me,
my dear,
grand Amerigo.
Go and bring
Charlotte.
She's staying
with the Assinghams,
but of course, she
has to stay with us.
Will you
bring my friend?
Si.
I don't feel
it's fair for me
just to give you a push
and let you go.
Let me go?
You're not letting me go.
You and Amerigo
are only moving
next door, practically-
the Carlton House Terrace.
But now it will be
he and I, and you alone.
We've lost our symmetry.
Symmetry?
Is it your wish then
that to keep it,
I had better
get married too?
Well, if you did,
I'd understand.
I certainly would.
And I know that
it was my fault.
Your fault?
Come here, my darling.
You're such a silly,
silly girl.
Do you know, the English
would call you absurd?
And in an American city,
what would we call you?
You know the words.
Talking through your hat.
Yes, yes, yes.
Talking through your hat.
You did a wonderful thing
for him, Fanny.
I mean it.
If I had to choose
a wife for him,
Maggie is perfect.
In herself, of course.
And of course,
in her father.
It was wonderful of you
to introduce them.
I want to do
something wonderful
for you, too, Charlotte.
You can't spend
your whole life
being a guest in
other people's houses.
You're made
for a grand life,
not a poor one.
You're not a poor person,
Charlotte.
All the same,
that's what I am-
poor.
You've never
told Maggie?
That you and the Prince
knew each other?
No.
Haven't we all decided
it's for the best?
That everyone should
have a fresh start?
A fresh start.
I was telling the Prince,
all we hear about nowadays
is him and the coming
great event.
My dear chap, we all
have to go through it.
Fanny will
take care of me.
Oh yes, Fanny takes
care of everyone.
So it's all right.
It's more
than all right.
See? You're not
rid of me.
I'm glad you've
returned to us.
I couldn't miss
Maggie's wedding.
You mustn't
miss anything.
And Baden-Baden
was just too beastly,
all those hotels
and the people in them,
the shops full of the most
vulgar, awful things-
Pink shoes and
umbrellas to match.
A lot of rubbish that
no one would want to buy.
Exactly! I had to leave
because I couldn't find
anything good enough
to give Maggie
for a wedding present.
You must help me
find something, Prince.
I know from our days in Rome
how you can bargain.
Yes, in Rome,
with my poor old Romans,
but in London
I'm not so effective.
There's nothing here
that she could wear.
Is there anything
that you could wear?
Are you offering me
a gift?
Would you take it?
If I did, what
should I do with it?
Wear it.
And if I did,
would I go home
and show it to Maggie
as your present?
Why in the world not?
This is what
I came back for,
to be with you
as we used to be
in our days in Rome.
Charlotte, why
are you saying this?
- I have to.
- You must not.
I want to say it.
I want you to know
that I came back
for us to be together
one more time before-
before what you're
going to do.
I'm not asking
anything from you.
What am I asking?
An hour or two,
no more.
Yes. An hour or two
to buy a present
for your friend.
I had to come.
I missed you so much.
I thought my heart-
Do you like it?
Do you like it?
What is it?
It's cut out of a single,
perfect crystal.
Perfect?
I can promise you that
you will never find any joint
or any piecing
together.
Even if I were
to scrape off the gold?
I'll wait
for you outside.
You couldn't scrape
the gold off it.
It's been put on by
some very old process.
Is there something
the matter with it?
It's to be a present
for a friend.
If it has a flaw,
I must know what it is.
Your friend would
never find a flaw.
Let me think
about it.
I will keep it
for you.
Thank you.
It seems so much
the right thing.
Didn't you see?
See what?
It has a crack.
I saw no crack.
I only saw
that it was beautiful.
That's the danger.
Danger?
To your marriage?
Danger to your happiness?
To everything.
You know how
superstitious I am.
Yes, papa.
Steady.
Let's put him back.
Attaboy.
Here we are.
I'm so pleased.
Oh, so pleased
to be here.
Is it just exactly
how you imagined?
Oh, I think it's
even more wonderful!
We must find Father.
He'll be so happy
to see you.
Welcome to Fawns,
Charlotte.
Thank you so much
for having me, Mr. Verver.
Charlotte's boat train
to Victoria was late,
but here she is,
safe and sound at last.
She hasn't slept a wink,
so I'm taking her to her room.
- Good idea.
- You can talk to her later.
Maggie has put you
in the Red Room.
It has two wonderful
Canaletto views of the house.
Unfortunately,
they're not ours.
It's so good
to have you here,
where you'll be
appreciated,
where you're loved.
I'm sure Charlotte
is appreciated
wherever she goes.
You'll have the best room
and I promise you
there are no ghosts
in it.
Here's Charlotte.
Charlotte.
She's extremely tired,
so I'm tucking her
straight into bed.
I don't want
to go to bed.
You'll have to visit later.
You look very tired to me.
Your room is
right this way.
You know what I think?
Hmm?
That you are
a tiny bit homesick.
I am at home.
Homesick for Italy.
Naturally, you'd want
to see Rome again,
a grand Roman
like you.
There's no reason now
we shouldn't go.
You mean, now that
Charlotte is here?
I would feel
perfectly easy
about leaving Father
and the Principino
in her care.
And Charlotte
is very competent.
Yes, she's
very practical.
I suppose
she's had to be.
But she's
romantic, too.
We must go-
if only to improve
my abysmal Italian.
It would be so good
to be in Rome.
You and I...
alone...
together.
That's really fine.
Really fine.
Do you know who
these ladies are?
Les Dames de Carité.
I've often wondered
who they are.
I don't know their names.
They came with the house.
And what
of the painters?
Hmm, the painters?
They, too, shall
remain nameless.
Charlotte, come
to the study.
There's something
I must show you.
Come now.
These are by Raphael.
This is the very first
drawing of his I ever bought.
I've been lucky
over the years...
and now I have five.
They never come
on the market anymore.
This is
my newest discovery.
But is it
by Raphael?
Or is it by Perugino,
his teacher?
It's beautiful.
Anyone would want it.
Don't you agree?
Yes!
I take these with me
wherever I go.
They make me feel
at home
in all the rented places
we live in.
They're like old friends
who can stay as long
as they like.
I've had a letter
from a Mr. Gutermann-Seuss.
He writes he has
a very interesting set
of Turkish tiles.
I plan to visit
Mr. Gutermann-Seuss.
One never knows
what one might not find.
Before she was married,
I always took Maggie with me.
I couldn't leave her
alone in a hotel.
As you know,
after her mother died,
there was no one else,
only she and I.
So from the age of 10,
she has visited
every dealer in Europe,
even some quite
shady characters
buying and selling
stolen goods
in some little room
in a back alley.
These are the plans
for the museum
I'm building
in American City.
Would you like
to see?
My ambition is to
create a Roman palace
on a piece
of barren wasteland.
These are the galleries,
Medieval collection,
Roman statuary.
Oh, the good citizens
of American City
are not too pleased
with the statuary.
There is some talk
of fig leaves,
even putting
brown paper
swimming costumes
on them.
That's how they
solved the problem
at the Uffizi.
Ridiculous.
They don't deserve
your generosity.
I guess they'd
rather have, uh,
new gasworks
in American City.
That's where
I got my start-
from bituminous coal.
It's a soft coal,
makes the best coking
coal in the world-
with the help of immigrant
labor, of course,
stoking the ovens.
They used to work
12 hours a day,
seven days a week,
year after year.
They've never seen
anything beautiful...
all their lives long.
I want to give them
something...
give something back-
more than lumps
of black coal.
I owe it to them-
to bring to them
all the treasures I can find.
So I go out and
buy it for them.
Like a pirate, I go
on my raiding expeditions,
ransacking
and plundering,
get the loot,
and I hide it.
I keep it here,
Paris, Italy,
some in Spain-
vaults, banks,
warehouses.
And one day
I'll pack it up
and take it all
back home with me.
It'll all go here.
to the ungrateful citizens
of American City.
That's my plan
for the future.
My dilemma,
of course,
is it's a large
task for one man.
I shouldn't be
keeping you up.
I promised to take
good care of you.
Maggie gave me the idea
it was the other way around.
Whichever way,
I know she'd be
mighty glad
that we're keeping
each other company.
She, uh...
she hates for me
to be alone without her.
She has this odd idea
that she's forsaken me.
Well, I suppose
that when a girl marries,
she does in a sense
forsake her father.
Maybe...
in a sense.
But I feel bad
that she feels bad...
about me, and...
I'm keeping you up
with all this talk.
No, no, not at all.
Well, we should
get some sleep.
Charlotte?
I'm glad
you've stayed on.
I'm happy to be here.
If I do go
to Camberwell to see
Mr. Gutermann-Seuss'
Turkish tiles...
I might come with you.
I would like that
very much.
Wonderful.
Good night,
Charlotte.
Good night.
You'd better
prepare yourself.
"I finally plucked up
my courage
and asked Charlotte
to be my wife.
And Charlotte,
wonderful as she is,
has answered, Provided
Maggie and the Prince approve.
So we should be
starting for Rome
to obtain in person
what we most anxiously
hope and trust
will be your consent."
Our consent.
"And of course, we shall
not miss the opportunity
to take in all the new
work at the Palazzo,
of which you write
such tantalizing reports."
They'll be here-
What's the date?
The fourth.
They'll be here,
I think, Wednesday
or Thursday
at the latest.
- Maggie!
- Charlotte.
Father.
Mag.
Do show Charlotte
the Palazzo.
She's never seen it.
I'm dying
to be taken
on a personal
Princely tour.
If you had seen it
the way it was
just two years ago-
it's a miracle
what has been done.
Do show her.
And this is where the first
Duke kept his museum of mummies,
in case you've forgotten.
Whenever he returned
from battle,
he brought
his captives back,
killed them and
stuffed them with straw
and dressed them-
Dear old Italy.
Ha ha!
It's impossible
to walk side by side
with that hat.
Not that it isn't
absolutely splendid.
A present
from my fiancé.
But I haven't yet
had your consent,
or any word
from you.
Are you not pleased
to be presented
with a bouncing
baby stepmother?
What you are doing
will take great courage.
Not only from you...
but from both of us.
It will take
all our best intentions,
Charlotte, for them...
All our...
our care.
They're good and...
and kind.
Of course.
They're
good children-
and the children
of good children.
You had several,
remember?
Hello?
There they are. Hello.
- Oh!
- Lady Cosby.
William Shepp.
Ah, you look marvelous.
They are certainly
a handsome couple.
Do you call a stepmother
and her son-in-law a couple?
What else do you call them
when they're seen together
here, there and everywhere?
I don't know what
she thinks she's doing.
What do you
expect her to do,
stay locked up in
Mr. Verver's cabinets
along with his other
handsome pieces?
... Three nights in a row.
I heard it
from her lips.
You liar.
You're lovely.
Ahem.
Fanny?
You say your husband
is ill?
He felt too ill
to come?
No, dear. If he had,
I wouldn't have left.
And yet Maggie
was worried?
She worries easily,
you know,
at least
about her father.
Don't you think
it would be more appropriate
for his wife to worry
about him than for his daughter?
You know how things
are with us.
Father and daughter
are happiest
when they're alone.
They're forever
arranging for it,
"I'll come to you
in Cleveland Row."
"No, I'll come to you
in Carlton House
Terrace."
They're like
two children
arranging
a doll's tea party.
They love it.
They're cozy together.
And where does
that leave you?
To be cozy on my own,
I suppose.
And the Prince?
We're in the same boat,
you know.
You are naturally
in Mr. Verver's boat.
Isn't the Prince also
in Mr. Verver's boat?
Where would he be,
if he were not?
- Where would you be?
- Precisely.
But now where I am
is fixed-
fixed as a pin
stuck up to its head
in a cushion.
Good evening.
Signora...
His Royal Highness
has expressed a desire
for your company.
May I have
the great honor
of introducing you
to His Royal Highness?
What in the world
would
His Royal Highness
want with me?
You must go
immediately.
It's a summons.
They send for
Charlotte through you?
No, my dear.
As you see,
through the Italian
ambassador.
That's your ambassador.
She's treated
as your appendage.
My "appendage"-
cara mia,
what a name!
I have noticed
before with you...
you like
to have a thing
without calling it
by its name.
I am as ready
as the next fellow
to call a spade
a spade.
Then let me name
this "spade."
Mrs. Verver
should be known less
as your mother-in-law,
and a little more
as her husband's wife.
For that, Mr. Verver
should be known
a little more
as his wife's husband.
She's no one's
appendage.
She is a splendid...
wonderful creature
in her own right.
So is your wife.
Believe me, cara,
I know
how fortunate I am
in my wife,
in my father-in-law,
in my mother-in-law,
and...
in my friend.
We are to be
photographed.
Come on.
Are you
composed, madam?
- Yes.
- Then, we will expose.
Excellent.
And once more.
That's perfect.
Now...
are you ready?
Si.
Very well.
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Then I shall expose.
Good.
Next.
Oh, damn.
Would you get that
for me, Bob?
I've got it.
I still don't see
why you should
blame yourself.
He needed a rich wife,
she a rich husband.
I introduced him
to Maggie.
I helped him
because I trusted him.
I still do.
Then you've
made up your mind
that it's all
poor Charlotte?
If only she'd
leave him alone.
Perhaps he doesn't
want to be left alone.
Don't forget,
the man's in a position
where he has nothing
in the world to do.
Poor, dear,
little Maggie.
I'm to blame.
I should've told her.
That her husband and her friend
had been... acquainted?
I never did understand why
that had to be kept from her.
There are things in life
that Maggie does not-
should not know.
Don't you feel that?
One has to protect
her innocence.
In that case,
is it any wonder
that the Prince
is bored with her?
No man of sense would
want to be married
to an ignorant child.
Come to bed.
"Come to bed."
That's your solution
to everything.
Mm.
Mm-hmm?
Mary, Queen of Scots.
Whoa... whoa...
whoa.
Good afternoon,
madam.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, ma'am.
Walk on!
Why have you come in a cab?
Where's your motor?
I left it at home.
I wanted to feel
as I used to
when I could do
as I liked.
I don't remember
that you ever liked...
knocking about
in discomfort.
It seems to me
I liked everything then.
Anyway, it brings back
the old feelings.
They come back.
They do.
Everything comes back.
Uh, you must...
awfully want your tea.
So let me give you
a good, strong cup.
Maggie has taken the boy
to Cleveland Row.
As usual,
they came before 11:00,
and they're still there.
I wonder what
they think-
what I'm doing,
what becomes of me while
they're so happy together?
Or, what becomes
of you?
Of course,
I'm happy they are happy,
and they so adore
my boy.
They'd have done the same
for one of yours.
It will never be.
Never?
Never.
It would have been
better for you.
It would have taken
more than any child of mine.
It would have taken
more than 10 children,
could I have had them
to keep our two spouses apart.
It's strange,
isn't it...
the way you and I are
so immensely alone?
Because they are
so immensely together.
Yes, it has struck me.
Sometimes...
sometimes I feel,
instead of more,
I understand less
and less these people
amongst whom
I've married.
Americans.
They're too different.
You understand me.
Oh, you.
You are the same
as I am.
You mean,
Italian and terrible.
No.
American and terrible.
And they?
They're simple,
and they're good.
That is why we have
to protect them.
Isn't that what we said,
in Rome, we would do?
Act together
to care for them?
Yes, we have to act
together.
Heaven knows they do.
When you go home,
where will you say
you've been?
I shall say
I've been here.
Keeping you company
in your solitude.
What else, my dear?
What in the world
else can we do?
Oh, your invitation
to Matcham.
Will that be all, sir?
Thank you.
We got ours yesterday.
We'll have a good time,
I promise you.
Those Matcham weekends
are such fun.
Oh...
Packing for
your weekend?
I hear you've
cried off.
Maggie told you,
did she?
I asked her to.
I didn't dare
tell you myself.
Such a pity.
She would have
enjoyed it.
She's a very silly girl.
She should go.
I told her so.
If nothing else, she shouldn't
be depriving Amerigo
of a good time.
Amerigo is going.
I can't show up
at Matcham by myself.
Should we, uh...
be asking him
to leave Maggie?
I'm sure he'd prefer
to stay with his wife.
No doubt,
but I can't carry the whole
thing off by myself, can I?
Charlotte-
would it matter
so very much
if you, too,
did not go?
No.
Of course
you must go.
The whole world
has to see you
in all your splendor.
It can't be wasted
on just one husband.
You know, Adam,
we can't all hide ourselves
away from the world.
Someone has to go
to this sort of things,
whether we want to
or not.
I know, I know.
Did you speak to him?
To whom?
Amerigo. What
did he have to say?
About what?
About the two of you
going to Matcham
alone.
What could he say,
since it was your wish
and not his, nor mine?
When you get there,
everyone will feel
very sorry for you,
that you're married
to a dreary husband
who does nothing
and goes nowhere.
That's what
they will say.
They can say
what they like.
And we can do
what we like.
Absolutely right.
One should always follow
one's clear conscience.
What about this one?
This is beautiful.
Shall we try it?
Oh, yes.
I think he cheated.
How is it possible
to cheat on a bicycle?
Italians can be
very devious.
One of his ancestors
was a pope,
and there were
any number of cardinals,
all of them with
dozens of children.
If that's not cheating,
I would like to know what is.
With these grand Romans,
it's "Aut Caesar aut nihil,"
either a Caesar or nothing.
"Aut vincere
aut mori..."
to win or to die.
Good show.
- Very well done.
- Bravo, Prince.
Bravissimo.
That's very becoming.
Come on,
it's our turn.
No, I don't think
Maggie and her father
would like it here.
If it's so bad for them,
how can it be
good for you?
You needn't be
ashamed of me.
For four years
I've lived the life,
I've thought
the thoughts
that best suited Maggie
and her father.
But there are times
when I have to get out
and stretch my legs
a little.
You mean,
you need to have
your own kind
of a good time?
No, for that
I wouldn't be here.
I'd be where I belong,
in the air
I was born to breathe.
So you still
long for it?
For Rome?
What do you think?
Every minute.
Every bit of me.
I'm just a silly when
the moon comes out
I hardly seem
to know what I'm about
- Skipping
- Hopping
Never, never stopping
We can't stand still
although we try...
Are you sure?
- That was correct.
- We may have bid too low.
You wait until
the game is over.
That's all right,
I feel confident.
When the moon
comes creeping
Around the sky
They've really got
something, haven't they?
Absolutely.
...moon
Aggravating moon...
Isn't he divine?
Mr. Blint has
a lovely voice.
Yes, but we need
more practice.
We're staying over tomorrow
when everyone else goes up.
Wouldn't it be fun
for you and the Prince
to stay over with us?
Just the four of us?
Would you like that?
...just as soon
As the daylight's gone
Well, it's then
I feel a foolish
sort of feeling
Coming on
I'm such a silly
when the moon comes out
I hardly seem to know
what I'm about
- Skipping
- Hopping
Never, never stopping
We can't keep still
although we try
I'm all a-quiver
when the moonbeams glance
That is the moment
when I long to dance
I can never
Close a sleepy eye
When the moon
comes creeping
Around the sky
Well done!
- Bravo!
- Encore.
Bob and I would be
delighted to take any train
that would suit
you and the Prince.
I feel almost as if
after all this time
I've seen nothing
of you.
Oh, that's awfully
sweet of you, darling,
but we've settled,
Amerigo and I,
to stay over
till after luncheon.
You're staying on?
Yes.
Charlotte promised
our hostess.
Rather a bore,
since it means that
I, too, must stay on.
You must stay
with Charlotte?
Yes, I must see her
decently home.
Mr. Verver and Maggie
would expect it.
Of course.
You might do us
one great favor.
Of course.
Leave word
at Cleveland Row
that we have been
kept over,
but that we shall be back
in time for dinner, hm?
I shall do better
than that.
I shall go straight
from the station
and report on
the situation here
for you and Charlotte.
That would be kind.
Yes, you can tell them
that we are bearing up.
You're bearing up?
- Yes.
- Good.
You needn't be
afraid of Fanny.
It's you
I'm afraid of,
sometimes.
Don't be.
She can't very well
go to your wife and say,
"I'm sorry, my dear,
for arranging your marriage.
I was mistaken."
She wasn't.
She's right.
Everything's right.
Then that's what I say.
They're happy.
We can be happy, too.
And if it didn't sound
so very vulgar...
I should say
that we're safe.
Good night, my dear.
Oh, is that you?
It's like playing
blind man's bluff up here,
the deuce only knows
what anyone's up to.
Ah, well...
Good night.
Good night to you
and Fanny.
Sleep well.
I sleep like a log.
It's Fanny who
lies there brooding.
Poor Fanny.
What does she have
to brood about?
Don't ask me,
these are things
far above my head.
Metaphysics
and Psychology.
Were you talking
to somebody?
I heard you.
I must have been talking
to myself again.
Poor old man.
Don't you lie to me.
There are enough people
doing that already.
What lie shall I
tell Maggie tomorrow?
You don't have to
tell her anything.
You said one has to
protect her innocence.
If she remains innocent
much longer,
she's going to lose
her husband.
I don't think he really
cares for Charlotte.
Men don't when
it's made too easy.
You have this
extraordinary notion
you know anything
about men and women.
I don't.
I leave all knowledge
of the human heart to you.
I'm only here to see
it doesn't land you in trouble.
I'm such a silly when
the moon comes-
Breathe deeply.
- After four.
- Making me laugh.
I'm such a silly when
the moon comes out
That's very good!
I hardly seem to know
what I'm about
Skipping, hopping
Never, never stopping
We can't keep still
although we try-
Are you looking
for Charlotte?
Because I think
she's looking for you.
Hunting for you.
Shh.
Yapping for you.
Don't be so naughty
and get on with your work.
My work is to
teach you to play.
I'm just a silly when
the moonbeams shine
That's all I do when
I da da da da-
Can't keep still
although we try
I'm all a-quiver
when the moonbeam-
It's after 11:00.
If we stop here
for luncheon,
then what becomes
of our afternoon?
Why should we stop here
for luncheon?
Our hostess-
Doesn't dream
of our staying.
She dreams only
of Mr. Blint.
That's Gloucester
over there.
It has
a very fine cathedral.
And everyone knows
whenever we've the chance,
we stop to see cathedrals.
I've discovered
the name of the inn.
There are two, but
I've chosen the right one.
You'll see.
You're terrible.
How do you know
so exactly
what I'm thinking?
I know it 10 miles off,
because it is always
what I'm thinking, too.
We have these harmonies.
Get your things.
Get your things
quick.
Hurry.
Presto, presto.
Thank you, sir.
Move on.
It has the tomb
of some very famous king.
How very interesting.
Richard II.
Or was it Edward II?
I know he was murdered
in some particularly horrible
and revolting way.
I thought it was only
we Italians that did that.
Oh, you Italians
with your poisons
and your daggers.
We might not make it home
in time for dinner.
They might not
even notice.
That anyone might imagine
that a man could be
left alone with a woman-
and a woman such as you.
Like Adam and Eve
before the fall.
That could not be.
It could not.
Why are you
in the dark?
Didn't you get our telegram
that we missed the train?
Yes.
It was so thoughtful
of you to send it.
You've dined?
With Father.
We were together
when your telegram came.
You have a new frock.
It's very pretty.
You like it?
I wore it tonight
at dinner...
for you.
But you've dined.
On such horrors.
We had an adventure.
Fanny told us what a success
Charlotte was at Matcham-
the beautiful, great,
grand Mrs. Verver
we're so proud of.
And that Lady Castledean
just could not bear
to part with her
and kept her over.
So that I, too,
was kept over.
I couldn't let her
come back alone.
Of course not.
Father said you did
the right thing.
He did?
Oh.
I thought
you would be asleep.
Oh, I couldn't.
I missed you
too much.
I missed you.
Wait till you hear
of our adventure.
Yours and Charlotte's?
We decided to visit
the cathedral at Gloucester.
It's a magnificent
cathedral, I believe,
with cloisters.
Yes,
and the tomb
of an old king.
The boy is asleep?
Hours ago.
Which king?
Hm?
Which king has
his tomb at Gloucester?
Oh. Um-
Is it Richard II,
or Edward II?
I've forgotten.
Don't wake him.
Then, what else?
What else besides
stupidly missing the train?
Where did you dine?
At a very nasty
little inn
on something
very nasty,
called, I believe,
The Shepherd's Pie,
English cooking.
What did you do?
We were with Father.
We stayed over at night.
Every night?
You were away Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday-
we came back
to Carlton House Terrace
on Sunday, thinking...
perhaps you might return
a day early instead of-
Instead of?
A day late.
I had a strange dream
on Sunday.
It was a nightmare
really.
You were afraid
and alone.
You should have stayed
with your father
in Cleveland Row.
No, I wasn't afraid.
And it began as a dream,
not a nightmare.
I was in
a beautiful pagoda,
all jeweled and plated
with colored porcelain.
And I loved being there
and I was happy.
I thought I was happy.
But then something
strange happened.
I can't describe it-
it was like
some strange sound.
No, it was a feeling
more than a sound,
like a warning.
I tapped the wall,
that beautiful
porcelain,
and then
there was a sound,
you know, the way
you tap something with a key,
and it gives out
a certain sound
that tells you
it has a crack.
It was like that, as if
the pagoda had a crack in it.
And that's where
the nightmare began,
because I thought
I was trapped in there
and it would
split apart
into thousands of
pieces and bury me alive.
It seemed
to be moving.
But you know what
frightened me the most?
It was that Father
would hear
I was trapped
in this...
terrible,
cracked pagoda,
and I thought,
"He mustn't know-
he must not ever
know of my danger,
I must not cry out."
And when I woke, I found I had
stuffed the sheet into my mouth
to stop myself
from crying out,
so that Father
wouldn't hear anything.
Shh.
And he...
he asked
absolutely nothing?
Not a word.
The subject of where
we had been
or why we had
missed the train
was apparently not
the slightest interest to him.
What must he
be thinking?
With him,
who can ever tell?
I believe even Maggie
doesn't know what he thinks.
She's with him now.
Of course, we have
no way of knowing
what she's telling him,
what they're saying
to each other.
About us?
About anything.
Why on earth did we meet
in this place?
Because no one we know,
or who knows us,
would ever dream of
coming here.
Huh.
Yes, we shouldn't be seen
too much together.
If we are,
it's their fault
making us go
everywhere together
while they sit at home
hatching their plans.
This is their latest-
my husband wants to take
your wife on a trip to Spain
to see a possible Goya
he's heard about.
Just the two of them
in their old way together,
leaving you and me-
In our old way together?
No. We mustn't
be seen alone-
and they mustn't be
left alone.
We must pair off
in a different way.
So, what is your idea?
You're so full of them.
My idea
is simply that...
you should be more
with my husband,
and I should be more
with your wife.
Only for a time.
Come.
I'm told you heard
of a Goya in Spain.
Yes, there's a possibility.
- Maggie told you?
- Charlotte did.
She said you were thinking of
taking Maggie with you
- when you go to see it.
- Yes, that's our plan,
provided we have your permission.
If that is what Maggie wishes.
Yes, of course. You would always
do what your wife wishes.
We are two ideal husbands,
you and I.
- I'm scared, granddaddy.
- Oh, are you?
- No.
- No, you don't scare so easy, do you?
Not like your poor
old granddaddy.
I can't imagine you afraid, sir,
of anything in the world.
Well, how little
you know me.
My heart is in my mouth
all the time.
If something might happen
to this boy,
or to Maggie, if she might be
harmed in some way,
I don't know of anything I might not
be capable of in such a case.
So I'm afraid.
Afraid myself too,
of what I might do,
if she were to get hurt.
There's a funny story.
This happened years ago.
In Paris.
On my very first visit,
honeymoon, with Maggie's mother.
We were in this restaurant,
and a man sitting at another table
was looking at my wife
in a kind of way I really
didn't like.
So I grabbed a knife off the table
and I rushed over to him -
It might not have even been the steak
knife, it was probably the butter knife!
I can still see his face,
stupid with astonishment.
I guess I thought
I was going to stab him,
and it was only when I felt my wife
hanging on my arm
that I lowered my hand
and dropped the knife.
She marched me out of there,
apologizing to everyone, left and right.
First and last time in my life
I fail to pay the check.
And no one ran after us.
I guess they were all scared to death
of that crazy, wild American.
"Who is this Monsieur Verver?"
Why is it there is
never anything
I can possibly eat?
Is there nothing at all?
What about this?
He hates aspic.
Why don't you try
the goose, Adam?
What are these
small birds?
I believe
that's pigeon.
I'll have the goose.
Oh, thank you.
Has he said
anything more to you
about the Goya
he wants to view?
No. Has he to you?
Perhaps you would go
with Father to Spain?
Most willingly.
I happen to like
my husband's company.
But I don't know that
he would like mine
in place of yours.
I'm sure that's not true.
It's hardly
a secret anymore
that he married me,
not for my sake,
not even for his own,
but for yours.
Perhaps Spain isn't
the best idea just now.
Unless he very much
wants it.
Unless you do.
But of course,
you would only want
what he wants.
And Amerigo.
Amerigo?
My husband.
I'd like to follow
my husband's wishes, too.
Do you know
what they are?
Do you?
Maggie.
I'm dreadfully
jealous.
You bring your
pretty wife here
and not to us
at Matcham?
What have we done
to be so horribly neglected
by you
and your father?
She's far too charming
to leave at home.
Next time I'm not going
to let her off the hook.
We had such fun.
I love your dress.
Is it Paquin?
Hello.
Look at you.
Turn around.
Delightful.
I tell you, there is
nothing like the French.
Charles Blint,
that's Lucy Moncreif.
- How do you do?
- Come on, Charlie.
She has
the biggest diamonds
and the reddest hair.
And the longest
false eyelashes.
On the falsest eyes.
I don't like her.
That is the first time
I've ever heard you say
you don't like someone.
You should say it
more often.
What are you two
talking about?
You must all have had
a very jolly time at Matcham.
Oh, it was
a fearful bore.
But Gloucester?
I'd have loved to have seen
the cathedral
with you.
Amerigo!
We must take Maggie
to Gloucester.
Yes, we must
absolutely all go.
Architecturally,
it's of tremendous interest.
And historically,
too, I believe,
with the tomb of some old king-
who was it?
Richard II.
Oh, was it?
I thought
it was Edward II.
I must have
been mistaken.
We should find
our seats.
- The Ritz.
- On Friday?
- One o'clock.
- Don't be late.
I won't.
What did
the marmalade cat want?
To find out what
I may have found out.
About her?
Well, she has
no stone to throw
at anyone else's window.
Mmm.
It's always a comfort
to know about one's friends.
Just as you can't
throw any, Fanny.
What stone
would I throw?
If you tried,
it would come
right back at you
in the most
horrid way.
Thank you so much.
Playing truant again.
Well, you know how I am
with this modern noise.
What is it anyway?
"Gavrilka."
Hmm.
Mighty loud.
Well, Mag, it looks
like we won't be taking
our little trip to Spain
after all.
No, it wouldn't be
fair to the others.
Nope.
It wouldn't be
fair to them.
But I do feel guilty
about you and Amerigo.
Why?
What have you
done to us?
Keeping the two
of you here
in domestic harness,
with me
and the Principino
and Charlotte-
when the two of you
must be longing
to get away
on your own.
So, Mag,
is it your idea then
to realign us-
the Prince and myself
on one side,
and Charlotte and you
on the other?
Wouldn't it be fun?
And how many couples
are there
who could even think
of such a thing?
Who're as fortunate
as we are,
the four of us,
to get on so well together?
Well, since we do,
let me make
another suggestion,
for a different
harmony this summer.
It's just like "Hamlet."
Thank the Lord
that's over.
You didn't like it?
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I wonder what
Fanny's thinking.
I know she's
thinking something.
You said that Fanny
doesn't matter.
Go in and take care
of your wife!
Come on, trust me,
I know what I'm doing.
Do you?
Then you are more
fortunate than I am.
"Everything's right,"
remember?
There you are!
Maggie helped me escape
the music of
the 20th century.
In the meantime,
we have been sitting here,
haven't we, Mag-
hatching a diabolical plot.
Father thinks
he would like
to go down early
to Fawns this year,
if that suits you two.
Perfectly.
We could all leave
together this very week,
if that's what
you prefer.
I prefer you and I
go first.
Yes, this weekend
if you'd like,
and stay there
on our own for a while.
Make the place habitable,
as it were.
What do you say,
Charlotte?
Wonderful.
Good.
Amerigo?
Yes.
Wonderful.
See, Mag, how fortunate
we are, the four of us?
We're always in
perfect agreement
on every plan
that is proposed.
Did you like
the dancing?
Next!
This stronghold,
constructed
in the Middle Ages,
upon the ruins
of a Roman fortress
is where the famous-
or should I say
infamous-
executions took place
of the third Duke's wife
and his son.
The boy Ugo was
the Duke's favorite,
which prompted
a jealous older brother
to lead their father
to Ugo
and their stepmother,
Parisina,
where they were found
in flagrante delicto.
The lovers were
at once seized
and dragged
to their deaths.
The boy was 16,
his stepmother,
twice that.
The Duke was soon remarried
to Eleonora of Aragon,
who was only 11 years old.
Next slide.
What awfulness
is there between them?
Between my husband
and my father's wife?
Between them?
What do you mean?
Anything there
shouldn't be.
Do you believe
there is?
Shh!
... caused his wife, Parisina,
and his adored son, Ugo,
her secret paramour,
to be beheaded.
It was the Fifth Duke
who first assumed the title
of Prince of Ugolini.
He also took the name
of Amerigo
after his famous
seafaring kinsman.
Come with us to Fawns,
Fanny, you and the Colonel.
Don't leave me alone there,
watching and guessing,
trying to make out
what lies I'm being told.
Charlotte has changed
towards me.
She might not
want us there.
It is her house.
It's my father's house.
The beautiful women
upon whom his eyes are cast,
he lures to love him
and moves them
in a wondrous way,
more powerfully than
the magnet influences iron.
It looks
the sort of place
where I might...
just might find
something odd and nice
for Father's birthday.
It is very pretty, but...
I'm not sure it would
quite do for my father.
Her father's Adam Verver.
Oh yes,
the American collector.
Mm-hmm.
You see, I wouldn't know
how to give him anything
that's, well...
anywhere near
good enough.
But he has this
very sweet theory
that a present given
out of affection
is in a special category.
He even has a special
glass cabinet
for such gifts.
Mine all figure in it.
Every single one of them
going back over the years.
Why do you say Charlotte
has turned against you?
Perhaps I'm only
imagining it.
One doesn't imagine
such things out of nothing-
out of thin air.
You must have some proof
for your suspicions.
Do you have any
for yours?
What's that?
It's something I've had
for a long time.
It's Byzantine.
I've been keeping it
for a lady
who said she would
come back for it.
A lady and a gentleman
with her-
be careful- her husband
or her fiancé.
It must be more
than five years now.
8th of July, 1903.
Three days before
my wedding.
They have not returned.
So I believe I am
within my rights to say
it is still for sale.
How much is it?
£300.
It might be just the thing
for Father's special cabinet.
Would you send it to me?
It will be delivered
tomorrow.
It is an honor.
Where is Byzantium,
actually?
They know I know.
But know what,
for heaven's sake?
Your husband
and your stepmother
have been intriguing,
day after day,
in your house
and in your father's?
Such a thought
would be unbearable.
One couldn't bear it.
One must bear
many things for love.
Love of your husband,
or your father?
For love.
It's so lonely
without them-
without Maggie
and the Principino.
And the Prince.
Oh Lord, yes,
how we miss
the little family.
But what a blessing,
darling.
We have each other.
I brought these
to show you.
Here is where we laid
the foundation stone.
We took this building out
between Fourth
and Fifth Street.
American City has
brought objection
that the museum
is encroaching
on a new
streetcar concession.
It's all a matter
of politics
and the usual payoffs.
If necessary I'll buy
both sides of the street.
But I ought to be there.
I can't leave it all
to the architect.
There is no reason why
you shouldn't go.
Is there any reason
why you shouldn't?
If I were to go,
say, next week,
would you come with me?
I would like to,
immensely-
Mm-hmm.
But it wouldn't be
very easy for us both
to go on such
short notice.
And you wouldn't have
to be gone very long.
How would it be
if we did go
for very long?
And if we were to stay
and start our work-
our real work, Charlotte,
you and me together-
not later, not at some
future time but now?
No!
I couldn't bear to think
of your collection...
all your treasures,
to be buried out there.
You call it a burial
to go to American City?
For your treasures, yes,
to be in a place where no one
could or would appreciate them,
it's like burying them
in a tomb.
A tomb?
My museum a tomb, eh?
Tombs can be very beautiful.
You've seen pictures
of the Taj Mahal,
the tomb in India
that an emperor built
for his beloved queen.
Yes.
After she was dead.
Of course.
No one would dream
of burying a queen
while she was still alive.
It's not as if they have
any use for it.
They want their streetcar,
not your museum.
They may not want it,
but they shall have it.
Charlotte?
I've just asked
for my supper in the study.
I have a heap
of letters to write.
I hope
you won't mind.
Good night.
Good night.
You've brought me
the golden bowl.
How kind of you.
Princess-
a most extraordinary
coincidence-
I told you that a lady
and a gentleman
had been interested
in the same golden bowl.
Now, I see here...
the same lady
and gentleman.
Are you sure?
They are not a couple
one can easily forget,
even after five years.
It was my impression
that they were affianced,
or perhaps
a newly married couple.
Each was trying to choose
a present for the other.
The lady liked
my golden bowl,
the gentleman did not.
To whom do I
write the check?
A.R. Jarvis.
J-A-R-V-I-S.
£300, you said?
No, Princess,
forgive me.
Half that sum
would be quite sufficient.
That is why
I came myself today.
I felt I had
to tell you
that the bowl
is cracked.
Yes, the crystal
is cracked.
I could not leave you
in ignorance
to give such a present
to your father.
Princess,
it has a flaw.
So...
£150 pounds
would be sufficient.
I thank you,
Princess.
I'm gonna get you!
You scared me.
Come here,
my big, scary boy.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
You look lovely,
dearest,
much too lovely
for our ambassador.
Poor dear man,
he still hasn't learned
how to throw
a decent dinner party.
Your father's
birthday present?
It has turned out
to be...
something
quite different.
Hmm.
It is beautiful.
It seems so,
but actually...
it has a flaw.
A flaw?
I can't see
any flaw.
That's what
is so deceptive.
It has a crack.
A crack?
You mean,
in the gold?
How is it so heavy?
It's crystal,
and was once,
I suppose,
worth something.
And now...?
Now it's just a gilded bowl
with a crack in it.
I can't
believe it.
It looks
so perfect.
Yes...
a perfect fake.
Maggie, dear...
what's wrong?
Do you remember
that nice man
told us in his shop
about the couple
who wanted to buy it?
I think he said
husband and wife,
but he may have meant
lovers.
He recognized them.
And he remembered
the date.
July 8, 1903.
We talked about it
in the shop,
three days before
our wedding.
They-
they were intimate,
you see.
It all depends
what you mean by that.
I mean they were
too intimate
to let me know
anything about it,
even to let me know
they had ever met.
And you knew nothing?
Suspected nothing?
Nothing?
Darling Fanny,
I know,
whatever you did...
or did not do,
I know it was with
the best intentions.
I tried hard.
I tried hard
to act for the best.
I'm sure of it.
I believe you.
But now, the best
you can do for me
is to lie for me,
to lie to Father,
because he
must not know.
Are you quite sure
he does not know?
No.
I'm not sure
at all.
All I'm sure of
is that...
his very first thought
is to keep me
from being hurt.
That's why he says
nothing.
And you say nothing?
Yes, when I had
only suspicions,
but now that
I have proof-
now that
this exists-
What if it did not exist?
What if you had
never found it?
But I did find it.
And now it's there,
in all its ugliness.
Look.
Put it down, Fanny.
I can't bear to see it.
Magic.
If I may, I'll take
your motor to the embassy
and send it back
for you.
Prince.
Do you recognize it?
No.
It's the bowl
you and Charlotte
almost bought-
in that little shop
in Bloomsbury.
Oh yes!
- Five years ago?
- Yes.
Three days before
your wedding-
Which was also
your wedding, my dear,
and that's the point.
The point of your excursion
alone with Charlotte?
In search of
a wedding present for you.
She wanted so much
to give you something.
And there was this fellow
in the shop
trying to palm his bowl
off on us,
but I saw at once,
that it wouldn't do,
that it was cracked.
But now it's mine,
this present
from you both.
What is it
you want me to say?
Nothing more.
This has said it all.
So I am grateful
that you left it
in the shop
for me to find,
so at last
I can be sure.
Sure of what?
Of what I've
been suspecting,
doubting, fearing
these many months.
And all this time
you've said nothing?
Nothing?
Oh, cara-
cara, you're deep.
No, it's you
who are deep.
For five years
you've said nothing-
not a word-
not even that you knew
each other before,
even that was kept
a secret from me
at the time
of our marriage.
Would it have made
any difference?
To our marriage?
Probably not.
Because even then,
as early as that,
I knew I couldn't
live without you,
which you knew
very well!
- You pretended to love me.
- No.
And you pretended
to love him!
- No!
- Why did he marry?
Why did he?
It was good before,
with only the three of us,
and then our boy.
None of us needed her.
Unless you did.
It's you I need...
and more
than ever now.
You mean
now that I know
and have to shield you
and Charlotte both?
But it's not you
I have to shield.
Has he said
anything?
To me?
Father
would die first.
His wife would know
better than I.
- You should ask her.
- As if I would.
But don't you
ask her everything?
Haven't I seen you both
arranging together?
It's a shame.
Fanny shouldn't
have done this.
Fanny wanted to destroy
the evidence.
But it's no longer possible
to be blind and stupid,
or for you
to think me so.
If I thought that,
then it would be I...
who was very stupid.
Tell me
what you want.
I want a happiness
without a hole in it.
I want the bowl
without a crack.
And now I don't have
a birthday present for Father.
Let me find something.
Maggie?
"My dearest heart,
you are in the next room
and I want to say
this to you
and I cannot.
So I am writing to you,
not like your husband,
but like a lover,
too full of love
and fear to speak out.
My life is only you,
nothing but you.
I have no words in English
and not even in Italian.
So hold my letter
in your hands- hold it
and keep it, please.
Hold and keep me."
Hello.
Could you pass me
the towel, please?
I'm afraid Daddy
wouldn't let us bathe Olmo.
He's been
worrying all day
about Olmo having
some dog disease.
Where is he?
Olmo?
He's in the Bow Room,
being made a fuss of.
Go and tell Amerigo
that dogs sometimes
don't feel like playing
not because they're sick,
but just sleepy and lazy.
All right.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get your feet,
and your paws
and your tail.
Ever since you came,
you and I haven't had
a moment alone together.
Has she said
anything to you?
Has who said anything?
Who?
Your wife!
Has she spoken
to you?
Naturally,
a husband and wife
do speak together.
Has your husband
said anything to you?
My husband speaks only
to your wife,
you know that.
But still
there is something-
something.
Amerigo, answer me.
Has she said anything
to you about us?
What has she said?
She has said
nothing.
- Nothing at all?
- Nothing at all.
She hasn't
found out?
Found out what?
Has Fanny
told her anything?
Why? What should
Fanny know to tell?
I don't trust Fanny.
You should.
She's been a good friend.
A very good friend
to the Ververs,
to father and daughter,
not to us.
Us?
You and I.
That's all there is
for me.
You and I.
As if you've
never married
and I've
never married
and there are only
those weeks we had together
in Rome
when you loved me.
Charlotte,
that's all
in the past.
In the past.
In the past,
is it?
Buried
and forgotten?
That's how it is.
It's easy
for you.
You can just turn away
and smoke your cigarettes
and play with your child
or your dog!
You yourself were
always saying to me
that we had to be careful,
that no one must suspect-
- Does she?
- I told you, no!
Are you telling me
the truth?
Don't you trust me?
Charlotte.
It came in the mail,
offered privately.
Isn't that the Raphael
in the Royal Collection
at Windsor?
Quite right.
You've learned something.
Living with you, I could
hardly fail but to learn.
How much longer are
the Assinghams staying with us?
I hope as usual they're
here for a good, long visit.
Fanny calls herself
our regular boarder.
But you know we have
many visitors coming next week.
We have many rooms.
Adam?
I feel uneasy
about Fanny.
I don't understand.
Fanny has changed
towards me.
And I feel as if she's
trying to change Maggie, too,
as if she were telling her
things about me.
Imaginary things,
of course,
lies, for all I know.
Forgive me,
it may be I
who am imagining things.
- It may be.
- But I can't help it...
because I feel
she has been successful.
Fanny has been successful
in influencing Maggie
and changing her
toward me.
Maggie would never change.
She is steady and true.
I know it
better than anyone-
since childhood we've been
each other's closest friends.
She wouldn't know
how to betray or lie,
except to protect those
that she loves.
And then I guess
she can tell lies
and pretend along
with the best of us.
If Maggie were to change
toward a friend,
it would not be
for mere slander.
It would be for
something truly terrible,
truly unforgivable.
Hmm?
The Raphael at Windsor
is a miniature reduction.
The original was sold
after the execution
of Charles I
and went into the collection
of Cardinal Mazarin.
And now
you're buying it.
I'm thinking
about it,
but they want
a great deal of money.
Are you sure
it's genuine?
You know I never act
until I'm sure.
I had a sad letter
from poor Isabel.
She's still in Venice
with that fearsome husband.
- What's his name?
- Feldman.
I'd love to help her
get away from him.
But what can anyone do?
I'm afraid she's made her bed.
Don't be scared of Maggie
giving away any secrets.
She doesn't know
one card from another.
I tried to teach her
for years,
but I gave up
in despair.
I used to play whist
with the aunt.
Whist, Fanny?
Whist.
She told me she warned
the uncle not to leave
all that money
to poor Isabel.
This girl would only fall
prey to some fortune hunter,
and of course, that's
exactly what happened.
What no one foresaw was
the dreadful fortune hunter
would turn out
to be an American
and not the usual
impecunious Italian.
It's your turn, Prince.
I was looking for you.
It's so close
indoors.
Yes...
even out here.
There may be
a storm.
Perhaps we should
go in.
Look at your father.
One wouldn't ever want to...
disturb
or distress him.
I know you feel
the same.
You're right.
I do feel it.
Maggie...
have you any complaint
against me?
Have I hurt you
in any way?
I've turned
this way and that,
trying to think
what I could have
possibly done
against you.
What wrong have I
done you?
Perhaps I've been
mistaken.
You have been
mistaken.
Oh.
How you relieve me!
You see,
I had to speak out-
it's in my nature.
I accuse you of nothing.
That's lucky.
I have never thought
of you as anything
but beautiful,
wonderful and good.
As I have thought
of you, my love.
Will you kiss me
on it, then?
She doesn't know
a thing.
You saw how
she kissed me.
Oh, yes, I saw.
You're very foolish.
You don't understand her.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Are you coming
to bed?
No.
I need
some fresh air.
It's too close inside
the house tonight.
It's stifling.
"He might shriek
as loud as he liked,
she took no notice
of him.
Then she went
to Gretel
and shook her
till she woke,
and cried, Get up,
little lazy bones,
fetch some wat-"
What's happening?
Why are you here,
darling?
There was a tiger
under his bed,
so he had to come
into ours.
Oh.
"Fetch some water
and cook something
nice for your brother.
He is in the stable
and has to be fattened.
When he's nice and fat,
I'll eat him."
This is a sad story.
It's his favorite.
When the children
are lost in the dark forest
and are eaten by a witch-
he only likes stories
where terrible things happen.
It comes from living
where there is no sunshine,
no blue sky,
not our kind of blue.
It would be wonderful,
wouldn't it,
to take him to Italy?
Father couldn't live
without the Principino.
Or without you?
Or you without him?
And I would never ask that,
you know I would not.
Not even if
you wanted it terribly?
If you wanted it
more than anything?
Not unless...
you wanted it
more than anything.
I should take him
to bed.
No.
Oh, I've got you.
Go away, Maggie.
You've been doing that
since you were little
and you have yet
to fool me.
Come here.
Look here.
These stairs
are too narrow,
are they not?
They do seem somewhat
narrow for the building.
Yes, I want
to widen them
so people can sit
and relax, converse,
enjoy the sun.
These are too narrow.
All the stairs are too narrow.
You should be
in bed,
not in here thinking
about your museum.
I never stop
thinking about it.
I dream about it.
It's my work,
what I've
staked myself on.
You see,
that's your greatness,
your great motive-
while all I have
is my own selfishness.
I'll believe that
when Amerigo
complains of you.
But don't you see?
It's he who is
my selfishness.
My selfish motive
for everything I do.
I love him so,
that I'd die for him.
I love him so,
that it's horrible.
So, you see,
for him...
which is really myself,
I've just given you up,
sacrificed you.
I might as well
have just...
shipped you back
to American City.
See here, Maggie,
if you go on
like that,
you'll make me wish
I had shipped back
to American City.
In fact, you make me
want to ship back myself.
You make me feel
as if American City
could be the best
place for us-
for me and Charlotte.
Now you're offering up
the two of you
as victims
to my selfishness.
Oh, young lady,
I'll let you know
the day I feel myself
to be your victim.
Meanwhile, I'll do
whatever I think is best.
Best for whom?
For you.
Of course.
Always,
always for me.
And what about you?
I can take care
of myself...
and my wife.
Don't you
believe in me?
More than in anyone.
And that's the way,
I think you believe in me.
Yeah...
about the way.
Yes.
Well, then.
Well, then.
Amerigo...
they don't own us.
One can't be shipped off
with all their goods
where and when
they please.
No one is shipping
you off.
You're going away to take
your rightful place.
You were born for it.
You can carry the torch
of civilization,
like the Statue
of Liberty.
I mean it.
Your husband is giving you
a great future.
There is no future for me
except to be with you.
Listen-
I'm ready to leave
this house tomorrow,
today- with nothing,
the way I came.
We can go anywhere.
Don't you understand?
I love my wife.
I love Maggie
more every day.
It's different
from anything before.
You're lying
to me.
You've always
lied to me.
No, not to you,
but to her.
And it will take me
a lifetime
to get the taste out
of my mouth of those lies.
The dishonor.
Charlotte,
the dishonor.
- Disonore.
- Liar!
This charming
cupid asleep on a dolphin,
dates from
about 1766,
and it's by
Joseph Nollekins.
I think there is
something very attractive
about Nollekins'
classical imitations,
which we could
compare to
a musician's variations
on a baroque theme.
I would
also like to point out,
that the marble boy
rests on a stand...
American City-
the very name must sound
like doom to her-
like some Indian
trading post
on the Oregon Trail.
And on the right,
"Rebecca at the Well."
We think it's
Giacomo Cavedoni.
She sees it
all before her.
She can't speak,
or resist,
or move
a little finger.
The subject is peasants
having a good meal,
1600s.
And all this is
leaving for America.
You ought to ask
some questions in Parliament.
Make it
a cause celebre.
Don't these things
belong in British museums?
It used to be
only thieves and murderers
were transported
overseas.
Now it's the portraits
of your ancestors.
I think you will all
agree with me when I say
this life-sized portrait
of King Henry VIII
by Hans Holbein dominates
all the other pictures in this room.
Holbein presents
the most striking depiction
of royal authority
in English art.
But to me, it is also
a chilling portrait
of the masculine ego
in all its brutal
physical strength
and hardness.
The subject matches
the cold hardness
of Holbein's
style here,
which brings out so well
the King's defiance
of all who stood
in his way,
including his
numerous women,
who, one by one,
went to their doom.
Please.
Amerigo?
Why don't you
go out to her?
No, you're right.
Of course, I should do it.
I owe it to her.
She ought to
understand you better.
Charlotte...
hasn't begun
to know you.
Then I hope
she never will.
I hope that she'll
never guess
it was I who asked Father
to take her away.
If you won't go to her,
I shall.
What will you
say to her?
It will depend on
what she will say to me,
whatever she can find
to save her pride.
Anything to make her
a little less unhappy.
It's only
one more lie.
Let it be the last,
my dear.
Wait. Wait.
I thought you might
find this interesting.
I've read something
by the same author.
I found it
rather contrived,
but I'll try this.
You might like some
of the social scenes.
They're well done.
I'm tired,
tired of this life
we've been leading.
I know that
you like it-
that it suits you,
but it doesn't
suit me.
I told my husband
our real life
isn't here-
his and mine.
That's why I decided
to take him home.
So it was
your decision?
Mine entirely.
I told him,
what's the use of
our staying here in England?
Our work is there,
waiting for us
in American City.
You see,
I'm very selfish.
I place
my husband first.
Well, since that's where
I place mine-
I'm taking him
away from you.
You're taking my father
away from me?
You've always been
jealous of our marriage.
From the very beginning
you've tried to come between us.
But I mean to keep
the man I married.
I want to have him at last,
a little to myself-
far away where you can
no longer work against us.
If that's what I've done,
then...
I appear to have failed.
You have failed.
I'm glad to hear you
admit it.
There, there, there.
The packers are
coming back on Thursday,
so I guess you and I
have a heap of work
ahead of us.
Very agreeable work.
With you there
to help me,
We'll soon have it all
in its proper place,
in its own museum,
its own city.
When they see
all of the treasure,
all my plunder,
unpacked and displayed,
oh, they'll learn
to like it, all right.
When they see you,
my dear,
won't they just
sit up and take notice?
They've never seen
the likes of you.
You'll make their eyes
snap right out of their head,
as they say over there.
