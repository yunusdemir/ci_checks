Tell you what?
About last night.
So, I go to that new spot
on, uh, Sixth and Main, right?
Right.
Nice atmosphere,
beautiful women, Danny.
Shit.
Why are you saying “shit"?
I asked you to come.
I see this chick,
cute girl, tight.
Model tight?
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm not fucking with them
anorexic girls no more, dude.
It's like fucking a 10-speed
bike with daddy issues.
True.
This girl,
she's put together, man,
I mean, nice tities,
nice ass, whole package.
But,
I think I kind of know her.
Hey, my name is Bernie.
Good for you.
You know Angela.
Yeah, I know Ang, too.
Right, Bernie.
Yeah.
Yeah, you used to date Angela.
Date?
No, I was fucking the shit out
of Angela, that's what that was.
You got those
edges nappy, huh?
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>

point, I'm intrigued.
Nothing makes a guy sexier than if
he screwed over a chick you hate.
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
It's like revenge by association.
Exactly.
So, this Bernie's got a pair.
It's ladies' night, I'm down, we get drunk.
- You buy?
- Of course, I buy. What am I, a dick?
She gets drunk, I get drunk
we go back to my place, right?
Listen to me,
Danny, this chick was insane.
But he gets too drunk.
See, you always let
them drink too much.
No. It is not
my fault he got...
Whiskey-dick?
Shame on you.
Dude, I had to keep up with her
drinking or else I look like a pussy.
It's not my fault my friend
downstairs couldn't keep it together.
You got two ways to
look at whiskey-dick.
The con is that your dick
is functionally dysfunctional.
The pro is that
your click gets extra
special attention for
his extra special needs.
How much extra special attention
did she have to give you?
It was heaven. She was down
there at least 20 minutes.
Any longer than that
and you might as well charge.
So, I'm pulling
out all the stops.
I'm talking dirty,
I do handwork...
I put on a goddamn slow jam.
I mean, I am impressing myself.
Mmm-hmm.
I am like an EMT crew
reviving a car crash victim.
Ha!
Do you know what I mean? I'm like
a hairdryer, lam blowing so hard.
But, I must admit,
it was well worth the wait.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Impressive,
but not threatening.
It's like the John
Legend of penises.
Mmm. That is impressive.
Very.
So I'm down there
and it is the...
Best head this year.
What?
Thorough, paid attention to detail,
took pride in her work, Danny.
Did she do your taxes as well?
Snarky, but I'll allow it.
Only reason why is because
you been crying in your beer
since crazy Alison left
your ass over a year ago.
I'm taking my time.
You know what your problem is?
You're too damn good-looking, man.
What?
See, guys like me gotta work a
lot harder than guys like you.
Guys like you don't appreciate the
wealth of asses at their disposal.
Best thing that could happen to your
face is an industrial accident.
Whatever.
I'm serious.

a nice-looking female,
take her back to your place,

You made Joan feel things?
Oh, I made her feel like good
and evil hung in the balance,
like we were at peace talks and her
orgasms were the end of genocide.

No! What are you doing?
This is your first
vacation in three years,
and you spend it
with Hugh Laurie.
He's the only
person in the world
who understands me.
He's really smart.
You know why, Deb?
Because Dr.
House knows something
that Debbie Sullivan
has yet to discover.
What?
All the answers in the world
won't solve your problems.
Call him.
You know you want to.
And also,
I'm seeing Bernie again.
I know.
How?
Come on. I'm depressed,
I'm not stupid.

You guys really went all out.
Thank you.
Well,
it's a very special evening.
Are you pregnant?
What? Hell, no.
Come on, don't you say
no shit like that.
Come on, Deb.
I mean, if you
wanna have a baby, baby,
you know,
I'm for what you want to do.
So don't ever think
that's in question.
So, are you coming to my
birthday dinner next week?
Yeah. Is Danny coming?
He won't be there, Deb.
Invite him.
It's his best friend.
Me? Friends?
No, I don't have no friends.
Deb, you don't even know that about me.
I don't believe in friends.
Only thing I
believe in is Joan
and whatever
undiscovered mystery's
lying between
those legs of hers.
My God.
You look so
good in this light.

Anyway, it is my birthday

Obviously. That's done. You already
know I'm on board with that.

You got it, baby?
You guys start.
Yep. It's fine.
Girl, you look good!
Real good.
Bernie, stop it!
- <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
- This looks so good.
- Shut up! Girl, look at me. Get the bag.
- What's this?
Listen to me.
The food is vile.
You hear me?
The bitch cannot cook.
Whatever you do, you do not
swallow the fucking food.
What you're gonna do is this.
You wait till she not looking, spit
it in the bag, get low. <font color="#808080">(POPS)</font>
Put it in the fucking bag. After you
do that, throw that shit in the trash.
Do it fast, 'cause if the food eat
through the bag, she'll smell it.
All right?
You're not listening.
You don't give a shit
about what I'm saying.
Okay, I gotta die for it,
don't mean you have to.
You on your own.
I tried to tell you.
Here she comes.
Put the bag down.

Awful.

I'm not gonna eat without my baby.
Can you believe this one?
<font color="#808080">(ALL CHUCKLING)</font>
Here, take some.
Before we do that, let's do
the thing before we eat.
What thing?
This is time for our
special announcement.
<font color="#808080">(CLEARS THROAT)</font>
It is.
I would like to take this time
to propose a toast.
Now, I don't know to what extent
you and Joan have talked about
the magic that's been going on
in our relationship.
Magic?
Lei him finish.
He wants to do this.
Baby, that's not true.
Okay, I don't want to do it.
I'm doing it because we
agreed that I'm better at it.
No. We didn't.
Yes, we did.
No.
Yes. You were worried about
how she was going to take it.
I said it's about
the presentation.
No, I said that
because I'm the one with her,
that I see her upset
and crying all the time.
No, baby. That's a lie.
You were the one talking about
she gonna slit her
wrists and all this shit.
Hey, hey!
I'm moving out.
Okay?
No.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No. No. What?
I found a place. I'm moving
out end of the month.
- You're not mad?
- No! Of course not.
Thank you so much,
because if you were mad at me, you
know what, I would totally understand.
Because I gave you so much shit
about moving in with a guy.
And then, I turn around
and have Bernie move in.
Although, we were together longer
than you and what's-his-name.
Even though we
weren't technically...
We were together a lot longer.
We were, we were.
It was on. It was magic.
<font color="#804040">BERNIE</font>: Yes.
And we were happier.
Their shit was fucked up.
It was fucked up!
And I said in the beginning
that wasn't gonna last.
No, no, no, remember
we had over and under.
You know, crash and bum. Crash and burn.
That's what we called them.
<font color="#808080">(BERNIE LAUGHING)</font>
Oh, my God.
Okay, okay, okay. I get it.
It's cool, I just didn't think
you were one of those girls
that drop your friends the second
you get some regular dick.
You got me.
Whoa.
<font color="#808080">(WHISTLES)</font> Back up. Regular dick?
Ain't nothing regular about my dick.
My dick is
completely irregular.
Okay, let's set
that record straight.
You got him started.
I give it two months.
Hey, before we drink,
so, like, what
are we talking about
with you being out?
<font color="#804040">JOAN</font>: No rush.
But let's put a number to it.
It's the 10th,
so you're talking 13...
This month has 30 or 31...
Thirty-one days.
That's gonna be crazy.
If it's 13, it's okay.
To you guys!
Thank you.
Oh, man. Butt-naked
running around the house.
<font color="#808080">(BOTH LAUGHING)</font>
It's on! It's on!
Your food should be
right up, all right?
<font color="#808080">(PACINO BARKS)</font>
How was he?
Great.
Hey, buddy. Hello.
He's getting really
strong and he pulls a lot.
Maybe you should get him
a harness or something.
Will do, will do.
Thanks for taking care of him.
Sure. I mean, it's my job.
So, I'll see you Tuesday.
Yeah. All right.
Nice dog Walker.

Hey, what you gonna do, man?
You coming 10 the Broadway bar?
Yeah, I'm just right around the corner,
man. I gotta walk Pacino home.
Well, hurry up.
Tell him Scent of a Woman
came out on Blu-ray.
That always makes him
take a shit when I walk him.

Yeah, he's all grown up now.
Yeah. I'll say.
I hope to be just
like him one day.
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
Are you going to Joan's?
Yeah.
You know, they told me you weren't
coming, so I wouldn't have...
No, it's cool.
I'm sure they couldn't resist.
You think?
Yeah.
I mean, old habits
die hard with them.
You look good.
You, too.
And Pacino looks
handsome and happy.
He's doing all right.
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy.
I was just gonna take him
for a walk around the park.
You wanna...
I mean, I'm sure Pacino
would want to spend
some quality time.
Yeah, sure.
<font color="#808080">(SCOFFS)</font>
She's not responding.
I think he's gonna
flake on me, too.
Wait, do they know we
tried to set them up?
Yeah, baby.
I mean, they're not stupid.
Wait, no, I take that back,
because Danny is a little slow.
Debbie ain't no
rocket scientist.
Danny might be in the top two dumbest
people I've ever met in my life.
That bitch barely thinks,
you know what I mean?
I think she spells
her name with one
<font color="#808080">(BOTH LAUGHING)</font>
Dumbass couple.
Stupid as fuck. Right?
That's why I
feel so bad, because
who else is
gonna be with them?
I mean, they're dumb.
That's true.
When you got two
people that dumb,
they gotta stay together.
That's true. You know what,
I think it takes us down,
hanging around them
the way that we were.
I felt that. I felt muted. My whole
time, I felt like I thought for her.
That's crazy,
'cause I swear I had
the same thing.
I remember one time,
Danny was talking
and I'm looking at him
while he talking
and I'm like...
I daydream when Debbie talks.
It's like
something else is going on.
That's what I try to do.
Ignorance.
And that is why I feel awful.
I mean,
you know, they keep
avoiding each other.
Yeah.
Dodging each other.
They were so in love.
That's how it is sometimes,
though. You know that.
I know, I hate...
Happy Birthday!
Uh-oh. There we go.
Wait a minute,
baby, is this cake chocolate?
Chocolate cake, chocolate
icing, chocolate filling.
Yeah, but I'm
allergic to chocolate.
I know.
<font color="#808080">(ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES)</font>
I fucking love you.
Did you just say,
"I love you“?"
No, I didn't finish my
sentence, is what I did.
Yes, you did.
I said I fucking love, and I was about
10 say something on the back of it.
Bernie, you are such a girl.
Whatever.
I do love you.
Better love me.
You can break my heart if you want to.
Love you, too.
<font color="#808080">(ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES)</font>
Listen.
I am, uh...
I'm sorry
for everything.
Truly.
Me, too.
And I'm glad
you're doing so well.
You, too.
I think we're just
gonna stay in tonight,
so you should go have a good
time with Bernie and Joan and...
I think I Will.
Do you wanna, um,
go out sometime?
Yeah.
Yeah. We should catch up.
We're gonna do once
more around the block.
Do you wanna join us?
Yeah. I think I will.
Yeah?
Yeah.
