You said, “I love you.”
I said, “Wait.”
I was about to say, “Take me.”
You said, “Go away.”
It was around 1912.
Jules, a foreigner in Paris,
asked Jim, whom he hardly knew,
to get him
into the Quatres Arts Ball.
Jim got him an invitation
and took him to the costumer's.
As Jules rummaged around
for a slave costume,
Jim's friendship
for Jules was born.
It grew at the ball
as Jules looked on,
his eyes full of gentleness
and good humor.
The next day saw their first real
conversation. Then they met every day.
Each taught the other his language
and culture till the early hours.
They shared their poems
and translated them together.
They also shared
a relative indifference towards money.
They chatted easily. Neither had ever
had such an attentive listener.
Jules had no girls in Paris,
and he wanted one.
Jim had several.
He introduced Jules to a musician.
Things started out well.
They were in love for about a week.
Then a free and easy girl came along
who stayed up all night in cafés.
Next it was a pretty blonde wide w.
The three went out together.
She confused Jules,
whom she found nice but clumsy.
She brought him a quiet friend -
too quiet for Jim's taste.
Finally, against Jim's advice,
Jules took up with professionals
but found no satisfaction there.
Let's get to work.
DEATH TO OTHE-
We're out of paint.
You little bitch!
Everyone will say
anarchists can't spell.
Save me!
Merlin's after me!
He's stronger than you!
Let's run for it!
Can you put me up for the night?
I'm Thérése.
Of course, Thérése.
Not at my place.
I'm expected elsewhere.
- Gilberte?
- Yes.
- But Jules could -
- Who's Jules?
- That's me.
- And you?
Jim and Jules, then?
No, Jules and Jim.
What's that?
It's better than a clock.
When all the sand's in the bottom,
I must go to sleep.
- You'll sleep here and I'll sleep there.
- That's right.
Got any cigarettes?
- Of course.
- Are you Jim?
- No, Jules.
You're sweet, Jules.
I'll do my steam engine for you.
The sun'll be up in ten minutes.
Jim, you might stay
and sleep here with me for once.
No, Gilberte.
If I stay today, I'll feel guilty
if I don't stay tomorrow.
If I stayed tomorrow,
we'd be as good as married.
Isn't that against our rules?
- What logic!
And Judex doesn't like
being left alone at home.
Besides, the night is gone,
and it's almost dawn.
Just imagine I'm a worker
heading off to the factory.
Cad! I know you're going home
to sleep until noon.
Over there.
No, no, it was Shakespeare.
No, I know that line -
Jules, give me
ten centimes for music.
It was Shakespeare,
I assure you.
- You have a cigarette?
- Yes, of course.
I like you very much.
Can you put me up for the night?
My name's Thérése.
Let her go, Jules.
Lose one, find ten more.
I wasn't in love with Thérése.
She was both...
mother and doting daughter
at the same time.
I have no luck
with Parisian women.
Fortunately there are
some girls back home.
I love one of them - Lucie.
I asked for her hand,
but she refused.
I've given myself six months
before I go see her again.
There's another too - Birgitta.
And yet another - Helga.
I might love her
if I didn't love Lucie.
Here's what she looks like.
Jules sketched a woman's face
in bold strokes on the round table.
Jim wanted to buy the table,
but the owner would only sell
all twelve tables as a set.
Albert?
This is Jim, a French friend.
- I believe we've met before.
- Yes, of course.
Sit down.
Jim asked -
Who's Albert?
A friend to painters
and sculptors.
He knows everyone
who'll be famous in ten years.
This one's more exotic.
She looks like an lncan statue.
This one's more Roman in style.
It's badly weathered
because I found it in a garden.
It had been rained on for ages.
This one's very touching.
Reminds you of a decaying face.
It's strange to see stone
worked in such a flabby manner.
I like this one very much.
It has beautiful lips.
A bit scornful.
Beautiful eyes, too.
We'd like to see
that last one again, please.
I took a close-up of it too.
The tranquil smile on the crudely
sculpted face mesmerized them.
The statue was in an outdoor museum
on an Adriatic island.
They set off immediately
to see it.
They both had
the same light suit made.
They spent an hour by the statue.
It exceeded their expectations.
They walked rapidly
around it in silence.
They didn't speak of it till the next day.
Had they ever met such a smile?
Never.
What if they ever did?
They'd follow it.
Jules and Jim returned home,
full of this revelation.
Paris took them gently back in.
- ls your book coming along?
- Yes, I've done quite a bit.
I think it'll be
quite autobiographical.
Our friendship will play
a major role in it.
I'd like to read a passage for you.
- Please do.
“Jacques and Julien
were inseparable.
Julien's last novel
had been a success.
He had described, as if in a fairy tale,
the women he'd known
before he met Jacques
or even Lucienne.
Jacques was proud
for Julien's sake.
People called them
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza...
and rumors circulated
about their unusual friendship.
They ate together
in small restaurants,
and each splurged
on the best cigars for the other.”
it's quite beautiful.
If you'd allow me,
I'd like to translate it into German.
Now let's hit the showers.
My cousin just wrote me.
Some girls are coming to Paris
who studied with him in Munich.
A girl from Berlin, one from Holland,
and a French girl.
They're coming
to dinner tomorrow.
I'm counting on you to join us.
Catherine, the French girl,
had the smile of the statue on the island.
Her nose, mouth, chin, and forehead
bore the nobility of a province
she personified as a child
in a religious celebration.
It started like a dream.
As the organizer
of this gathering,
I propose we abolish forever
monsieur, madame, and mademoiselle
by drinking my favorite
Nussberger wine in brotherhood.
Instead of linking arms
in the usual way,
the feet of all those partaking
will touch under the table.
And thus they did. In high spirits,
Jules moved his feet away.
Jim's feet stayed a moment
near Catherine's,
who gently moved hers away first.
A shy, happy smile
played on Jules' lips
and told the others
he held them in his heart.
Jules vanished for a month.
He saw Catherine
every day on his own.
But the two friends
naturally met at the gymnasium.
Very good, Jules.
Why don't you spend the evening
with Catherine and me?
Very well.
I've talked
so much about you.
Catherine's eager
to know you better.
But not this one, Jim, all right?
Hello, Mr. Jim.
You must pronounce his name
as in English, with a D in front.
“Zheem” doesn't fit him.
What do you think
of our friend Thomas?
Can we be seen
in public with him?
Not bad at all.
Perhaps just a tiny mustache.
Now for a test in the street.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you give me a light?
Thank you, sir.
Catherine was proud
of her successful disguise.
The men were moved,
as if by a symbol
they didn't understand.
- Either it's raining or I'm dreaming.
- Or both.
If it's raining,
let's go to the seashore.
We leave tomorrow.
This track looks excellent.
I propose a race.
First one
to the end of the bridge.
Ready?
- You cheated, Thomas.
- But I won.
Thomas always wins.
He speaks three languages
and swims like a fish.
Can he do a handstand?
You can teach him.
Monsieur Jim,
would you come help me
take my bags
to the station tomorrow?
She's a strange breed.
Her father was an aristocrat.
Her mother came from the masses.
He was of an old Burgundian family.
She was English.
That's why she's ignorant
of anything in between
and teaches
those who look at her -
- Teaches them what?
- Shakespeare.
Jim considered her to be Jules' and
didn't try to form a clear picture of her.
Catherine once again
wore that calm smile.
It came naturally to her
and expressed everything about her.
I'm almost ready.
I just have to put on my dress.
Never put a hat on a bed.
- Are we taking the bike?
The bag too?
What are you doing?
- Burning these lies.
Give me a match.
My God!
Don't move.
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Pass me my dress.
At the foot of the bed.
- Got a broom?
- Yes, right under your nose.
Can you help me?
There.
We're taking that too.
What is it?
Sulfuric acid,
for the eyes of men who tell lies.
That bottle will break
and burn all your things.
Besides, you can buy
that anywhere.
- Really?
- Yes.
But it wouldn't be
the same bottle.
I swore I'd only use
this bottle.
What am I forgetting?
My hat.
Your hat.
They searched up and down the coast
before finding the house of their dreams.
Though too big, it was isolated, imposing,
white inside and out, and empty.
- Sleep well?
- Very well.
Is Jim awake?
I don't know.
- How's everyone else?
- Everyone else is fine.
What a beautiful day.
Hurry up.
We're going to the beach.
Come on, Jim.
We're off in search
of the last signs of civilization.
A piece of tire.
- Look.
- A bottle.
Old shoes.
A can.
Watch out in back.
Look, Catherine.
Watch out. it's steep.
Matches.
A postcard.
A piece of porcelain.
A cup and a cigarette butt.
A pack of English cigarettes.
I think we're lost, boys.
The house.
You think I'm right
to want to marry her?
Answer honestly.
Is she cut out
to be a wife and mother?
I'm afraid she'll never
be happy on this earth.
She's a vision for all,
perhaps not meant
for any one man alone.
We must go on.
I'm not moving.
L give UP-
Hey, boys, come help me.
Let's go, kids.
At last a book I enjoyed.
A man -
German, of course -
who dares to say out loud
what I think inside.
The sky we see
is a hollow ball
no bigger than that.
And we walk upright,
with our heads towards the center.
The attraction pulls
towards the outside under our feet,
towards that solid crust
in which this bubble is enclosed.
How thick is the crust,
and what's beyond it?
Go find out. That's no question
to raise among gentlemen.
Give me your answer tomorrow.
If it's no, I'll ask again
every year on your birthday.
You haven't known many women,
but I've known plenty of men.
It averages out.
We might make an honest couple.
I asked Catherine to marry me.
She's more or less said yes.
At 15, I was in love
with Napoleon.
I dreamt I met him
in an elevator.
He got me pregnant
and I never saw him again.
Poor Napoleon.
As a little girl I learned:
“Our Father who art in heaven.”
I thought it said
“who arts in heaven.”
I imagined my father with an easel
painting outside the pearly gates.
I believe I just said
something funny.
In any case, amusing.
You might at least smile.
Will anyone present
scratch my back?
Heaven scratches those
who scratch themselves.
What?
- Heaven scratches those -
- Take that!
I never laughed
before I met you two.
I always looked like this.
But that's over for good.
Now it's like this.
Really?
It's raining.
Come see.
I miss Paris.
Let's go back, please.
We'll be in Paris
tomorrow evening.
I've sold my book.
This is for Catherine.
This is for you two.
- Beautiful.
- Wonderful!
- What is this?
- A little hand to scratch your back.
Very practical.
I've got three tickets
for the theater tonight.
What are we going to see?
A new play
by a Swedish author.
The play is at 9:00.
When all the sand's in the bottom,
we must get dressed.
Jim saw his friends often
and enjoyed their company.
The great Merovingian bed
was officially inaugurated.
Jules' two pillows
lay side by side on the bed,
and the bed smelled nice.
Catherine grew more beautiful
and learned to live again.
All the same, I like that girl.
She wants to be free. She invents
her own life every moment.
Jim doesn't look pleased.
Frankly, no. it's a confused
and self-indulgent play.
Another writer who revels
in vice to preach virtue.
We don't even know
when or where it takes place.
He doesn't say
if the heroine is a virgin.
That's not important.
Usually not, but since he states
that the hero is impotent,
his brother is homosexual,
and his sister-in-law is a nymphomaniac,
shouldn't he give physical details
about the heroine?
No. Besides,
that's all you two think about.
Absolutely. And your presence
encourages us.
No psychology tonight, Jules.
It's not psychology.
It's metaphysics.
The most important factor in any
relationship is the woman's fidelity.
The husband's is secondary.
Who was it who wrote,
“Woman is natural,
therefore abominable?”
Baudelaire, but he was
describing a certain world.
Not at all.
He spoke of women
in general.
What he says
about a young girl is magnificent:
“Horror, monster, assassin
of the arts, little fool, little slut.
The greatest idiocy combined
with the greatest depravity.”
Wait. I'm not finished.
This is marvelous:
“I'm always astonished
they allow women inside churches.
What could they possibly have
to say to God?”
- You're both fools.
- I didn't say anything.
And I don't necessarily agree with what
Jules says at 2:00 in the morning.
- Then protest.
- I am protesting.
Catherine's plunge
so astonished Jim
that he drew it the next day,
though he didn't usually draw.
Admiration for Catherine
welled up in him,
and he sent her
a kiss in his mind.
He was calm.
He imagined himself swimming with her
and holding his breath to frighten Jules.
Catherine, why?
You're crazy!
Catherine, take my hand.
You're crazy!
Catherine's hat drifted away
with the current.
Jules was pale, silent, less self-assured,
and more handsome than ever.
Catherine wore her same smile,
like a modest young general
after his first brilliant campaign.
No one spoke of her plunge.
I've arrived.
Please, Mr. Jim.
No, just Jim.
Just Mm...
I'd like to meet with you
to ask your advice.
Would you meet me tomorrow
at 7:00 in our cafe'?
Yes. She wants
to talk to you.
Very well.
I'll be there at 7:00.
- You're joking.
- I never joke.
I have no sense of humor,
I assure you.
Of course, I know people who do.
My wife's friends, coworkers.
But personally
I have no sense of humor.
With his usual optimism,
Jim had arrived late.
He was upset with himself,
afraid he had missed her.
He thought, “A girl like that
might well have left at 7:01.
A woman like that could have
rushed across the room,
never noticing me
behind my newspaper, and left. ”
He kept repeating to himself,
“A woman like that.”
But just what was she like?
For the first time, he began
to really think about Catherine.
Another coffee, please.
Waiter, another glass.
Jim? Did I wake you?
Catherine and I are going
to my country to get married.
Bravo, Jules!
Please tell her
I'm sorry I was late.
I waited
until ten before 8:00.
She's more optimistic than you
where time's concerned.
She was at the hairdresser's
and arrived at 8:00
to dine with you.
If I'd known she might still come,
I'd have waited till midnight.
I'll put her on.
She wants to speak to you.
Hello, Jim? I'm very happy.
Jules is going to teach me
French boxing.
With an Austrian accent.
Me? I've lost my accent.
My pronunciation is perfect.
Let me show you.
Arise, children of our motherland
Now here is our glorious day
Over us the bloodstained banner
of tyranny holds sway
Repeat.
Do you hear in our fields
the roar of those fierce fighting men
Who've come right into our midst
to slaughter sons, wives, and kin
To arms, citizens
Form up in serried ranks
March on, march on
And drench our fields
with their tainted blood
Into the fight
we too shall enter
When our fathers
are dead and gone
We shall find their bones
laid down to rest
With the fame
of their glories won
Repeat.
War broke out
a few days later.
Jules and Jim were called up
by their respective armies
and lost touch
for a long time.
The war dragged on and on,
and men settled into it.
Gradually a normal life emerged,
marked by the different seasons,
with its down time, routines,
pauses,
and even distractions.
Jim received parcels
from Gilberte.
He almost saw her a few times,
but his leave was canceled every time.
Then, in spring of 1916,
he spent a week in Paris.
You don't marry a girl
just for sending you packages.
We're fine as we are.
All right, but I still feel
we'll grow old together.
- How's your friend Jules?
- No news of him since his marriage.
In the trenches,
sometimes I'm afraid I'll kill him.
My darling...
I never stop thinking of you.
Not of your soul -
I no longer believe in that -
but of your body,
your thighs, your hips,
and of your belly,
and our son inside.
I have no more envelopes.
I don't know how I'll get this letter to you.
I'm being sent to the Russian front.
It will be tough...
but I prefer it to the constant fear
here of killing Jim.
My darling...
I kiss your lips passionately.
Jules' country had lost the war.
Jim's had won.
But the true victory
was that both were still alive.
They made contact through a neutral
country and resumed correspondence.
Catherine and Jules lived
in a chalet on the Rhine.
A daughter, Sabine,
was born.
Jim wrote Jules, “Should I marry
and have children too?”
Jules replied,
“Come and judge for yourself.”
Catherine added
a few words of invitation.
Jim left. It was such an important
event that he took his time.
He lingered in several towns
along the Rhine.
A large Paris paper was publishing
his articles on postwar Germany.
He wanted to revisit the places
where he'd fought the hardest.
Some places had been
so heavily bombarded
that the land was a mass of iron
where nothing could ever grow again.
They became cemeteries where Jim
searched crosses for familiar names
and schoolchildren
were already brought to visit.
Catherine was waiting
at the station with her daughter.
Her glance shone with imagination
and daring barely held in check.
This is Sabine.
Hello, Mr. Jim.
Jules is anxious to see you.
Jim felt she was making a long-delayed
appearance for their cafe' rendezvous
and had dressed up
especially for him.
She took him to their chalet, surrounded
by pines near a sloping meadow.
- How's everyone else?
- Oh, you know.
- You haven't changed, Jim.
- Nor have you, Jules.
So no one has changed.
Sit down.
Come here, Sabine.
No, thanks.
- You want some?
- Just a bit.
No, thanks. I no longer smoke,
even since I began to love plants.
An angel is passing by.
Of course. it's 1:20.
So?
Angels always pass by
at 20 past the hour.
- Really?
- So I've heard.
I didn't know that.
- Neither did I.
- It's true.
And at 20
before the hour as well.
So you won the war, you louse!
I'd rather have won all this.
You must be hungry.
Let's eat.
I'll show you
the house after lunch.
Jim there, Jules here,
and Sabine next to me.
How's your new novel?
These damned articles
won't let me finish it.
I have to think about them all week,
write them Friday night,
and send them off via airmail.
And you?
I received a commission
for a book on dragonflies.
I'm writing the text
and gathering pictures.
Catherine is illustrating it.
Even Sabine is helping.
She goes with me
into the swamps.
I'm going to build
an artificial swamp
in the garden.
One day I may return
to literature with a love story
in which the characters
are insects.
I have a bad tendency
to overspecialize.
I envy how widely
you cast your net...
Jim.
Me? I'm a failure. Sorel,
my teacher, taught me all I know.
“What do you want to be,”
he asked. “A diplomat.”
“Do you have a large fortune?”
“No.71
“Are you related to anyone famous?”
“No.7!
“Then forget about diplomacy.”
“Then what can I become?”
“An inquiring mind.”
“That's not a career.”
“Not yet.
Travel, write, translate.
Learn to live anywhere,
beginning now.
The future's bright
for those who question.
The French have holed up
behind their borders for too long.
Some newspaper will always pay
for your escapades.”
Jules thinks you have
a bright future.
So do I. But, I may add...
not necessarily spectacular.
Jules works and sleeps here.
Our life's as organized
as in a monastery.
Jules writes his books
and hunts his insects
and other little creatures.
Mathilde, whom you saw,
is the daughter of a nearby farmer.
She helps me with the housework
and with Sabine.
My room.
That's Jules.
Yes, his father
liked Mozart so much
that he dressed him up
one day as Mozart.
This is the balcony.
That's the inn
where you'll sleep tonight.
Jules will take you there later.
Jules and Jim resumed
their long-interrupted conversation.
They talked about the war.
Jules avoided talking about his family.
Catherine was both
kind and stern with Jules,
but Jim sensed something
wasn't going well.
To bed, sleepyhead.
The bedbugs are hungry.
Once upon a time...
there was
a nice little bedbug.
Good night, Sabine.
Good night, Jim.
See you in the morning.
- Good night, Jules.
- I want to talk to you.
How does Catherine
seem to you?
Marriage and motherhood
suit her.
She's less the grasshopper now
and more the ant.
Don't be deceived.
True, she brings order
and harmony to this house.
But if things go too smoothly,
discontent sets in.
She lashes out at everything
with her gestures and expressions.
I've always thought as much.
A little Napoleon.
She claims the world is rich
and that one can cheat
a little now and then.
She begs God
in advance for forgiveness,
certain she'll obtain it.
I'm afraid she may leave us.
- Impossible.
- No, she's already done so.
For six months I thought
she'd never come back.
I can feel she's ready
to leave again.
She's no longer
altogether my wife, Jim.
She's had lovers -
three that I know of.
One on the eve of our wedding,
as a farewell to her youth,
and as revenge
for something I did
that I'm still unaware of.
I'm not the man she needs,
and she's not the kind
of woman to put up with that.
I'm accustomed
to her occasional infidelities,
but I couldn't stand
to see her go.
Then there's Albert.
The singer who found the statue?
You remember?
We came to know her through him.
He was wounded in the war.
He's convalescing
in a nearby village.
Catherine's encouraged him
and given him hope.
He's a headstrong man.
He's spoken his mind to me.
He wants to marry her
and take the child too.
I don't blame him.
I don't blame her or Albert.
I'm slowly renouncing
my claim to her...
and all I had hoped for
from the world.
That Buddhist monk in you
is what she loves
and why she'll never leave you.
She's usually
sweet and generous,
but when she thinks
she's not sufficiently appreciated,
she becomes terrible
and swings violently
from one extreme to the other.
Listen to that
mole cricket's song.
It's a kind of mole.
Jim could see the chalet
from his bedroom window.
So Catherine, the radiant queen
of the house, was ready to fly off.
Jim wasn't surprised.
He recalled Jules' mistakes
with Therese, Lucie, and all the others.
He knew that Catherine
was terribly demanding.
Jim was sad for Jules,
yet he couldn't condemn Catherine.
She jumped into men's arms
like she'd jumped into the river.
A threat hung
over the household.
The second week began.
Time to say good night.
Yes, Mommy.
Jim, I need
to speak to you later.
Will you be free?
- Certainly.
- Come see me.
Keep in mind
that words can't have
the same meaning
across languages,
because they're not
of the same gender.
Unlike in French,
“war,” “death,” and “moon”
are masculine in German,
while “sun” and “love”
are feminine.
“Life” is neuter.
- Life, neuter?
Very pretty
and very logical.
In France too, skirts became shorter
the longer the war went on.
It caused many a shouting match
for married soldiers on leave.
Men felt they were
played for fools.
But the reason was that
fabric was scarce.
Yes, just as women
cut their hair short
for safety
around factory machinery.
It's time you started
to appreciate German beer, Jim.
Jim is like me - French.
He couldn't care less about German beer.
- Not at all.
- What?
France has the greatest variety
of wines in Europe. In the world!
Look at the Bordeaux:
Château Lame,
Château Margaux, Château d'Yquem...
And even better ones too, like -
wait a minute.
Clos-Vougeot, and the Burgundies:
Romane, Chambertin...
And the Beaujolais: Pouilly-Fuissé,
Pouilly-Loché, Moulin-é-Vent...
All eyes were fixed
on the mortar shell
as it rolled down the steps.
Three steps, two steps -
Hit the ground!
Catch me.
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing. I want to listen.
- So you can judge me?
- God forbid.
I don't want to tell you anything.
I want to question you.
My question is:
Tell me about yourself.
- All right, but tell you what?
- Doesn't matter.
Just talk away.
Jim began, “There were once
two young men...” whom he didn't name.
He told of their friendship in Paris
before meeting a certain girl,
the impact she had on them,
and all that ensued.
Even the line,
“Not this one, Jim.”
There he couldn't avoid
saying his own name.
He described the trio's outings,
their trip to the seashore.
Catherine saw that Jim remembered
everything about her very clearly.
She argued a few points on principle
and added other details.
He described the missed
rendezvous in the cafe,
and the three of them
seen through his eyes.
He spoke
of Jules' hidden qualities
and how he'd sensed that Jules
could never keep Catherine.
- You'd have told me all that in the cafe'?
- Yes.
Go on.
There's nothing more to say.
There was the war,
my joy at finding Jules again,
you coming to the station,
the happy days
I've spent with you here,
what I've seen, what I've learned,
what I've suspected,
this cloud on the horizon -
I mean Albert.
- Are you for Jules and against me?
- No more than he is himself.
I'll tell the whole story now
the way I've experienced it.
It was Jules' generosity,
innocence, and vulnerability
that dazzled me
and won me over.
He was such a contrast
to other men.
By bringing him happiness,
I hoped to cure him of his insecurities,
but I realized
they were part of him.
Our happiness - for we were happy -
didn't take hold,
and we found ourselves
face-to-face
instead of merged as one.
His family was torture for me.
At a reception
the eve before our wedding,
Jules' mother committed a gaffe
that wounded me deeply.
By doing nothing,
Jules tacitly condoned it.
I punished him
by spending a few hours
with an old lover, Harold.
Yes, a lover.
That way I could marry Jules
with all scores settled.
We could start over from zero.
Luckily, his family moved up north.
I don't know where.
The war broke out.
Jules left for the Russian front.
He wrote me
ardent love letters,
wonderful letters.
From afar my love for him grew.
I gave him a new halo.
The real break between us
occurred during his first leave.
I felt as if I was
in a stranger's arms.
He left. Sabine was born
nine months later.
She doesn't look
much like Jules.
Believe what you want,
but she's his.
I said, “I've given you a daughter.
That's enough.
That chapter is closed. I want
my own bedroom, my own freedom.”
Remember our friend Fortunio?
He was free as a bird.
So was I.
He was a sweet partner.
What a vacation.
But he was too young.
It wasn't serious.
Then one day,
to my surprise,
I missed Jules' indulgence,
his unhurried ways.
My daughter drew me like a magnet.
I was on the wrong track.
I left.
I've only been back
three months.
Jules is finished for me
as a husband.
Don't feel sorry for him.
The distractions I provide
are still enough for him.
Then there's Albert.
He told me of that statue
you three loved
that I apparently resemble.
I flirted with him.
He can be strange, but he has
a natural authority that Jules lacks.
He wants me to leave everything
and marry him.
He'll take mother
and daughter both.
I like him a lot,
but that's all so far.
He's coming to lunch tomorrow.
I'll see.
You've listened attentively.
I talked more than you.
I don't pretend to have told all,
no more than you did.
Perhaps I've had other lovers.
That's my business.
I spoke only of the things
you mentioned.
- I understand.
- I don't want to be understood.
It's almost dawn.
Jim desired her,
but he fought it back more than ever.
She mustn't leave.
To what extent was Jim about to act
for Jules' sake? For his own sake?
He'd never know.
Perhaps she was seducing him,
though Jim was far from sure.
It was impossible to tell.
Catherine revealed her goals
only when she'd achieved them.
- Hello, Sabine.
- Hello, Albert.
- How are you? How's your mother?
- Fine.
- So you sacrificed your mustache too?
- Like everyone else.
But I don't like it. I feel naked.
I'm going to grow it back.
Albert was wounded in the war.
In the trenches.
I'm all right now,
but when I woke up
and saw the doctors probing inside
my skull, I thought of Oscar Wilde.
“O Lord, spare me
the physical pain.
I can cope
with the spiritual pain.”
What's appalling about war
is that it deprives man
of his own individual battle.
Yes, but I think he can wage his battle
outside the field of war.
I'm thinking of a gunner
I met in the hospital.
Returning from leave,
he met a girl on a train.
They talked
from Nice to Marseilles.
Stepping down onto the platform,
she gave him her address.
He wrote her frantically from
the trenches every day for two years
on bits of wrapping paper,
by candlelight.
As bombs rained down, his letters
became ever more intimate.
At first it was “Dear Miss”
and “Yours truly.”
By the third letter he called her
“My little lamb” and asked for her picture.
Then it was “My adorable lamb.”
Then “I kiss your hand.”
Then “I kiss your forehead.”
Later he described
the picture she'd sent
and wrote of her breasts, which
he thought he glimpsed under her robe.
Soon he was addressing her intimately.
“I love you terribly.”
One day he wrote to her mother,
asking for the daughter's hand.
He became her fiancé
without ever seeing her again.
As the war continued, his letters
became even more intimate.
“L make you mine, my love.
I caress your adorable breasts.
I press your naked body
against mine.”
When she replied rather coldly,
he was enraged and begged her
not to flirt with him,
for he could die at any time,
and he was right.
You see, Jules, to understand
this extraordinary seduction by mail,
you have to have known
the violence of trench warfare,
that collective madness
where death is present every moment.
So here's a man
who took part in the Great War
yet managed to wage his own
individual battle at the same time
and win a woman's heart
through long-distance persuasion.
Like you, he had a head wound
when he arrived at the hospital,
but he wasn't as lucky as you.
He died after surgery
on the eve of the Armistice.
In his last letter to the fiancee
he hardly knew, he wrote,
“Your breasts are
the only bombs I love.”
I'll show you
some pictures of him.
Flip through them quickly
and he seems to be moving.
Beautiful story, Jim.
Jules wrote me beautiful letters
from the war too.
Hello, Albert.
Did you finish my song?
Come up and let's work on it.
The rocking of this chair
calls us to the pleasures of the flesh.
- What about the song?
- We've just about got it.
We do, don't we?
Shall we?
It's too good for them,
but one can't choose one's audience.
On every finger she wore rings
Round her wrists,
bracelets and things
She sang in a voice
all the While
That left my heart beguiled
Her eyes were like
two opals bright
That gave me a thrill,
gave me a chill
Her face was like
an opal white
As she moved in for the kill
We met, said adieu
and then met anew
We lost touch and then
we lost touch again
Once more we did meet
For moments so sweet
Only to retreat
We went our own ways
In life's whirlpool of days
I saw her again
in one evenings glow
It all seemed so long ago
I recognized her
as the banjos danced
The! mysterious smile
left my hear?' entranced
That voice so bright
That face so white
I fell into a trance
I drank and heard
her song so gay
Alcohol takes time's sting away
I awoke in her embrace
Felt her kisses on my face
We met, said adieu
and then met anew
We lost touch and then
we lost touch again
Said hello from the heart
Then strayed apart
But then again it starts
We went our own ways
In life's whirlpool of days
We met again one night,
and well
Into my arms again she fell
When the first time you knew
and the second time too
It was just right for you
Why say adieu
When you feel in your heart
it's right from the start
Then you mustn't part
So we set off together anew
Spinning through life,
just me and you
We whirl on
through life this way
Embracing till this day
Catherine meant
different things to each
and couldn't please them all,
but too bad.
Jim could only admire Catherine
unreservedly on her own.
In the company of others,
she changed in his eyes.
Good night.
Our affection is new. We should
let it rest like a newborn baby.
You were very much in love, Jim.
I can feel that.
Why didn't you marry her?
- It just didn't happen.
- What's she like?
- Sensible and patient.
She says she'll wait for me forever.
Her name is Gilberte.
Do you still love her,
and she you?
Don't cause suffering, Jim.
I need adventure and risk.
And... now there's
something new too.
I admire you, Catherine.
I've come to love seeing you.
I'm afraid I'll forget Jules.
You mustn't forget him.
You must warn him.
Translation, Catherine?
“Hearts yearning for each other
O God, O God, the pain they cause”
Not bad.
Though “O God, O God”
was your addition. Good night.
Give my regards to the others
if you see them.
Would you lend me Goethe's
Elective Affinities tonight ?
I just lent it to Jim.
Too bad.
Good night, Jim.
I'll bring it tomorrow.
You must bring Affinities back.
She insists on reading it tonight.
Jim, she doesn't want me anymore.
I'm terrified I'll lose her, that she'll
disappear entirely from my life.
The last time I saw you two
side by side,
you looked like a couple.
Love her, marry her,
and let me see her.
I mean, if you love her,
stop thinking of me as an obstacle.
Jim had waited for her all day.
She was in his arms,
speaking in her deep voice.
It was their first kiss,
and it lasted all night.
They didn't speak
but drew close instead.
Towards dawn, they become one.
Her face expressed
incredible joy and curiosity.
Jim was enslaved.
Other women
had ceased to exist for him.
It's your turn.
I've asked Jim
to move into the house.
He'll take the small room.
Be careful, Jim...
for her sake and your own.
This is your makeshift room.
These books are in German,
but you'll find others in my room.
The armoire.
I'll unpack your bag.
I think it will do.
From here on it's a mess,
but there's nothing
to be done about that.
What's on the other side?
Sabine and Mathilde's room.
The bed isn't too bad.
Sit down next to me.
I've always loved
the nape of your neck.
The only part of you
I could look at unnoticed.
What about Jules?
He loves us both.
He won't be surprised,
and this way he'll suffer less.
We'll go on loving
and respecting him.
They were known in the village
as the three lunatics,
but otherwise
they were well liked.
On hearing that, Catherine
in vented a game: the village idiot.
The village was the table.
They took turns as the idiot.
Sabine especially
set them roaring with laughter.
Catherine had said,
“One only truly loves for a moment,”
but for her, that moment
came back again and again.
Life was one long holiday.
Jules and Jim had never
handled such large dominoes.
Time passed.
Happiness isn't easy to tell of
and wears out without anyone noticing.
One Sunday,
Catherine decided to seduce Jules.
While Jim read downstairs,
she took Jules into her room.
Jules kept saying no,
but Catherine kept saying yes.
Though Jim told himself he had
no right to be jealous, he was anyway.
Catherine noticed this
and never repeated the experiment.
One day, the four walked
around a lake
hidden in the mist
of a lush, humid valley.
There was complete harmony
between them.
Catherine had a brief headache.
Jim had worse, from fatigue.
He thought,
“If we had children,
they'd be tall and thin
and have headaches too.”
On the shore of the lake
they played with pebbles.
She made them
throw them endlessly.
She and Jules learned
to make them skip.
The sky seemed so near.
Jim was needed in Paris.
His paper was calling for him.
Leaving would have been agony
but for the certainty
they'd be together again soon, intact.
The details of their perfect month together
were engraved in their memories.
They waved gently
for a long time as he left.
Jules gave them a sort of blessing
and promised Jim he'd take care of her,
for they wanted to marry
and have children.
Jules has agreed
to a quick divorce.
I'm going to marry Catherine.
I want to have
children with her.
Jules will find me work
in his country.
I'm translating a play from Vienna
to be performed here.
Where are you going?
- Home.
- I'll go with you.
- No, I'd rather you didn't.
Hello, Jim.
Therese - the steam engine.
Thérése, how are you?
How'd it go with -
Two glorious weeks. Cheated on him
to buy him his dream pipe.
He found out and got jealous.
Locked me up for three weeks.
At first I was flattered,
then furious.
Snuck down a painter's ladder
and ran off - with the painter.
But I get antsy.
Another guy promises riches.
I follow him to Cairo,
where he sets me up in a brothel -
...police turn me over to some nuns.
An Englishman rescues me.
I move into his villa on the Red Sea.
I play tennis, I ride horses.
Then I get a letter.
- Is Jules in Paris?
- No, he didn't come.
Too bad.
...I head home to break up
my cousin's marriage and marry him.
- Hello, Jim. How's your buddy?
- Just fine.
- Still with the same girl?
- Yes.
Must be doing well.
...a respectable man. I pursued him,
but he wasn't interested.
The husband I abandoned
finally divorced me.
The undertaker finally marries me,
convinced at last.
It's a perfect marriage,
but no children.
The only man I could never cheat on -
he leaves me no time or energy.
Now I'm writing my memoirs for
the Sunday Times Magazine in Europe.
Here's my husband.
- What about you, Jim?
- I'm getting married.
Good-bye, Thérése.
- Hello there.
- Hello, Jim. How's Jules?
Just fine.
Interesting, isn't she?
Her name is Denise.
Don't bother talking to her.
She won't answer.
She never talks.
She's not an idiot.
Just empty.
Nothing in there.
She's just a thing.
- A pretty thing.
- Yes, a beautiful object.
It's just sex.
Unadulterated sex.
Say good-bye to the gentleman.
- Good-bye.
Catherine spent the winter
at home before the fireplace.
She was Jim's fiancee,
entrusted to Jules.
She asked Jules every day,
“Do you think Jim loves me?”
Listen, Gilberte.
If Catherine decides
she wants something
and thinks
no one will be hurt -
though she could be wrong,
of course -
she does it
for her own pleasure
and to learn from the experience.
She hopes this way
to attain wisdom one day.
That could take a long time.
Don't be mean.
I'm not being mean.
I'm jealous.
I've known for a long time
it would end this way.
Jim, don't leave tomorrow.
She'll have you the rest of her life.
Give me just one more week.
Jim could no more leave Gilberte
than Catherine could leave Jules.
They couldn't hurt
Jules or Gilberte,
who counterbalanced each other
as the fruit of the past.
“Tell Jules I ran into Therese,
now married and a writer.
I must delay
my return once again,
but I'll soon be free
to return to you.
I still have
a few farewells to say.”
“A few farewells.”
Do you think Jim loves me?
Hello, Jules.
What's wrong?
Why didn't Catherine
come to meet me?
She wasn't happy
with your letters.
You wrote too much
about your work, your farewells.
She doesn't like absences.
Yours was too long.
When in doubt, she always outdoes
what might have been done to her.
- But she's waiting for us?
- Yes, I think so. Of course.
I didn't want to tell you.
She left yesterday morning
without explanation.
I hoped she'd be back
before you arrived.
Aren't you worried?
You mean, that something
may have happened to her?
I just think she's out
committing some irreparable act.
I told you your letter
didn't make a good impression.
“L ran into Thérése,
now married and a writer.
I still have
a few farewells to say.”
No, whatever Catherine does,
she does fully.
She's a force of nature
that manifests in cataclysms.
In every circumstance
she lives in clarity and harmony,
convinced of her own innocence.
- You speak as if she were a queen.
- She is a queen!
Let me be frank.
Catherine's not especially beautiful
or intelligent or sincere,
but she's a real woman.
It's that woman
whom you and I love,
whom all men desire.
If she's so sought after,
why did she give us
the gift of her presence?
Because we gave her
our undivided attention, like a queen.
I swear
I almost didn't come.
I knew things could never again
be as good between us.
Even our friendship
suffers from it.
At times I'm jealous
of your happy years with her
and even hate you
for not being jealous of me.
You believe that?
I'll do anything
not to lose her completely.
And you'll be like me
when she returns,
for she always returns.
Listen, help me.
I'm going back to Paris.
Tell her you went to the station
but I wasn't there.
I've made up my mind.
It's the only solution.
I see. I met the train,
but you weren't on it.
Hello.
What's the matter?
You just arrived.
There, now you're mine
and I'm yours. All is well.
But in your letters, you spoke so much
of your affairs. Well, I have my own.
You spoke of bidding farewell
to your loves.
I decided to bid farewell
to mine too.
You'll hold me in your arms
all night long, but that's all.
We want a child, don't we?
Well, if I had one now,
I wouldn't know if it was yours.
You understand?
I had to do it.
- Do you love Albert?
Does he love you?
- Yes.
You must believe me. It was
the only way to even things between us.
Albert equals Gilberte.
You have nothing to say?
We must start
with a clean slate.
A clean slate, all debts paid.
That was Catherine's philosophy.
They lay there,
trembling and chaste.
Catherine fell asleep,
but Jim never closed his eyes.
He realized she loved him
as he loved her,
that some force
drew them together.
So they started over again,
flying high like great birds of prey.
They remained chaste until she was sure
she wasn't carrying Albert's child.
This restraint left them elated.
They were always together.
They never cheated.
The promised land was in view.
THE PROMISED LAND
ABRUPTLY RECEDED
When they were ready for a child,
Catherine didn't become pregnant.
They saw a specialist,
who told them to be patient,
that these things took months
with many couples.
What's wrong?
I want to sleep alone.
Go to your room.
- Why?
- I just do.
- Explain.
- There's nothing to explain.
I'll just lie here by your side.
I'll be good.
That's not true.
Anyway, I don't care if you're good.
I'm disgusted.
It's a nightmare
when the evening comes.
I think of the child we'll never have.
I feel I'm taking some test.
I can't stand it anymore.
- Our love is all that counts.
No, because I count too,
and I love you less.
Let's try to do
without each other.
If I find out too late I still love you,
that's the risk I take.
Go back to Gilberte,
since she writes you every day.
- You're unfair.
- No doubt I am.
But I'm heartless.
That's why I don't love you,
and why I'll never love anyone.
Besides,
I'm 32 and you're 29.
When you're 40 and I'm 43,
you'll want a girl of 25,
and I'll be left all alone
like a fool.
Maybe you're right.
I'll leave tomorrow.
Let's separate
for three months.
Are you hurt?
Then I'll stop being hurt.
We mustn't ever
both suffer at once.
When you stop suffering,
I'll start.
Am I disturbing you?
I can't take it anymore.
Did you hear us arguing?
- No, I was working.
I can't stand him any longer.
I'm going mad.
Anyway, he's leaving tomorrow.
Good riddance.
Don't be unfair.
You know he loves you.
I don't know anymore.
I really don't.
He lied to me.
He didn't break up with Gilberte.
He doesn't know what he wants himself.
“You love her, you don't love her,
you'll end up loving her.”
I can't help it
if we couldn't have a child.
- You got a cigarette?
- You want one?
- Want me to talk to him?
- No, please don't.
I'm half for him
and half against him.
But I want him to go.
We've decided to separate
for three months.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a good idea.
Don't you want to tell me
what you think?
I know very well
you despise me.
I will never despise you.
I'll always love you,
whatever you do,
whatever happens.
Is that true, Jules?
I love you too.
We really were happy together,
weren't we?
We still are.
At least I am.
Really?
Yes, we'll stay together always...
like an old couple,
with Sabine and our grandchildren.
Keep me close to you.
I don't want to go back to him
before he leaves.
Then you stay here.
I'll sleep downstairs.
My little Catherine.
You often make me think
of a Chinese play I saw
before the war.
The curtain rises, and the emperor
turns to the audience and says...
“You see before you
the unhappiest of men,
because I have two wives:
wife number one
and wife number two.”
For Jules their love was now relative,
while his for Catherine had been absolute.
Jim left the house
the next morning.
Catherine wanted to take him
to the station once more.
A mist had settled
over the meadow during the night.
The rest of the hive sensed confusedly
that Jim had lost favor with its queen
and thus naturally should leave.
The house
has already disappeared.
The autumn railway schedule
had just taken effect.
There was no train
until the next day.
One always feels guilty
in a hotel room.
I may not be very moral, but I have
no taste for secrecy. But you do.
Don't deny it.
I wouldn't believe you.
Jim thought of the children
they might have had.
He imagined a houseful
of handsome children.
He also knew
that if they had none,
Catherine would take up
her adventures again.
They didn't speak, but they made love
in that cold, sad hotel room,
no! knowing why - perhaps
to bring their story to a close.
It was like a burial,
or as if they were already dead.
The next day she took him to his train,
but they didn't wave good-bye.
They parted on the verge of tears,
though nothing forced them to.
Jim thought to himself once again
that it was all over.
Here's your inhaler.
There was a letter too.
I think I'm pregnant.
Come. Catherine.
Gilberte, please give me
some writing paper.
Catherine, I'm very ill,
in no shape to get out of bed,
and I've no desire to come see you,
most likely pregnant by another,
for our pitiful good-bye
couldn't have succeeded
where our greatest love failed.
“...where our greatest love failed.”
You're right. I don't believe
a word about this illness.
I'll write him immediately
and say you wish to see him.
Dear Imaginary Invalid,
come as soon as you can.
Catherine awaits a letter.
Write in large letters,
for her eyes are tired
and she can only read
large writing.
Catherine doesn't believe
I'm really sick,
and I wonder
if she's really pregnant.
In any case,
it's unlikely I'm the father.
My doubts are well justified
by our past,
Albert, and all the rest.
Since you're going out,
could you mail this letter?
Certainly.
Oh, there's a letter for you.
I'm late. See you later.
I love you, Jim.
So many unbelievable things
we can't understand
turn out to be true.
I'm finally going
to have a child.
Let us thank God.
Bow down before him.
I'm absolutely certain
you're the father.
I beg you to believe me.
Your love is now alive within me.
You must believe me.
This paper is your skin.
This ink is my blood.
I'm pressing hard so the ink enters in.
Answer me quickly.
Darling, I believe you,
and I believe in you. I'm coming to you.
I know whatever bit of good
I find within me comes from you.
They'd promised
never to call each other,
fearing to hear each other's voice
when they couldn't touch.
The mail took three days.
Their letters crossed.
“My doubts are well justified
by our past, Albert, and all the rest.”
I'll think no more of you
so that you'll stop thinking of me.
You disgust me now,
which is wrong,
for one should never
be disgusted by anything.
My Jim, your long letter
changes everything.
You'll be here in two days.
You - not just a letter.
Let's forget our harsh words
of days ago. They're gone.
Come when you can,
but let it be soon,
even late at night.
Finally Jim received
a letter from Jules.
“Your child died early
in the womb.
Catherine wishes only silence
between you from now on.”
So they had created nothing.
Jim thought, “It's fine to want
to rediscover the laws for human life,
but how practical it must be
to conform to existing ones.
We gambled with the sources
of life and lost.”
It can't be.
I can't believe it!
You gave up
your chalet for good?
Yes, we prefer to live
in France now.
We've rented
an old mill on the Seine.
We absolutely must get together.
Please come by tomorrow.
Very well.
Please tell me about Catherine.
For a long time
I feared she'd kill herself.
She'd bought a gun.
She'd say,
“So-and-so killed himself”
like others say,
“So-and-so died of cholera.”
She withdrew into herself
like a widow,
as if recovering
from a serious illness.
She moved in slow motion,
with the fixed smile of a corpse.
Gilberte,
this is my friend Jules.
Jim's told me so much about you.
I feel like I know you very well.
Does Catherine know
you've come to see me?
Yes. She invites you
for a ride in her car.
I hope you'll accept,
and perhaps your wife -
She won't accept, but I will.
I must be going.
No, Jules! You can't wear a hat
like that, at least not in France.
Take mine.
- Very well.
Come. it's over there.
She's in very good spirits
this morning.
Please don't upset her.
- Me?
It's wonderful here.
That's Catherine's car.
Come.
Jim's here.
Catherine was smiling, but she had
a look of intrigue about her.
She wrapped her white pajamas
in a parcel just so.
Jim wondered why
but then forgot about it,
and they left for a drive.
I'm so hungry.
Shall we eat here?
Albert,
what are you doing here?
Getting some fresh air.
Besides, I live here.
- Will you eat with us?
- I'd love to, if it's right away.
- You have a date in town perhaps?
- Perhaps.
Give me my little package.
Good night.
Well-played second act, including
the bit with the white pajamas.
I wasn't expecting it.
I'm surprised she didn't give
that role to a new leading man.
She's used Albert so often.
- But why? He was perfect for tonight.
Leave her the car.
Catherine's maxim is:
At least one party
in a relationship must be faithful.
The other party.
- I must get home.
You saw
that I'm not living alone.
I'm going to marry Gilberte.
- You're a wiser man than I.
You've realized that with Catherine,
when it's over, it's really over.
Gilberte will make a good wife.
She's very beautiful.
Jim recognized the rhythmic call
of Catherine's car.
At first he saw nothing.
Then he saw the car
weaving among the trees
on the empty square,
grazing benches and trees
like a riderless horse or phantom ship.
What an awful night.
I don't know what I was doing there.
That kind of life
was dead for me.
It was a desert to die in.
I kept speaking of you,
looking for you.
Come right away.
Lie down next to me.
Kiss me.
There's something I must tell you.
It's rather long.
Tell me.
I found a passage you'd marked
in a book you lent me.
“A woman on a ship
gives herself
in her imagination to a stranger.”
It struck me as a confession.
That's how you explore
the universe.
I feel that keen curiosity too.
Perhaps everyone does.
I control it for your sake,
but I'm not sure you do for mine.
I agree with you that in love
a couple is not ideal.
You only have to look around.
You wanted to invent
something better
by rejecting hypocrisy
and resignation.
You wanted to invent love.
But pioneers must be
humble and unselfish.
We must face the truth.
We failed.
We made a mess of everything.
You tried to change me
to suit you.
I tried to spread joy,
but I've created only pain.
My promise to Gilberte
that we'd grow old together
means nothing
because I can put it off forever.
It's like a counterfeit bill.
I no longer hope to marry you.
You must know:
I'm going to marry Gilberte.
She and I
can still have children.
That's a beautiful story.
But what about me?
What about
the children I wanted?
You didn't want them.
Yes, I did.
They would have been beautiful.
You're going to die.
You disgust me.
I'm going to kill you.
You're a coward.
You're scared.
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
Jim was glad to see Jules
and to find his heart
no longer leapt at seeing Catherine.
She didn't want to leave them alone
and suggested a drive.
Jim agreed.
What was in store this time?
Catherine toyed with the speed
of her car and took
almost imperceptible risks.
There was an air of expectancy,
like the day of their outing
when they'd met Albert.
They stopped
at an open-air café by the water.
Now they're burning books.
It's unbelievable.
For Catherine,
you were easy to get
and hard to keep.
Your love waned and soared
with hers.
I never knew
those ups and downs.
Mr. Jim...
I have something to tell you.
Would you come with me?
Jules, watch us carefully.
Jules would no longer dread,
as he had from the start,
that Catherine would cheat on him
or quite simply die,
since it had happened now.
Their bodies were found
entangled among the reeds.
Jim's coffin
was even larger than life,
dwarfing Catherine's at its side.
They left nothing of themselves,
but Jules had his daughter.
Had Catherine loved conflict
for conflict's sake? No.
But she'd bewildered Jules with it
to the point of nausea.
A sense of relief
flooded over him.
Jules' and Jim's friendship
had no equivalent in love.
They delighted together
in the smallest things.
They accepted
their differences with tenderness.
From the start, everyone called them
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.
The ashes were placed in urns
and sealed in separate compartments.
Jules would have mingled them.
Catherine had always wanted hers
scattered to the winds from a hilltop,
but it was against regulations.
