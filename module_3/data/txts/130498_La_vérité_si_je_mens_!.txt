Good evening and welcome
to Would I Lie To You,
the show with tall tales
and tantalising truths.
On Lee Mack's team tonight,
an actress who recently played
the part of Anne Boleyn.
Very exciting.
Although, spoiler alert,
she's not in the second series!
It's Cariad Lloyd.
APPLAUSE
And a comedian, who when
he was on Celebrity MasterChef,
arranged his herbs
in alphabetical order.
Where did he find the thyme?
Probably next to the parsley!
It's Ade Edmondson.
APPLAUSE
And over on David Mitchell's
team tonight,
a singer who is one half
of Rizzle Kicks.
So tonight's biggest lie
will be when David pretends
he's heard of them!
It's Jordan Stephens.
APPLAUSE
And as part of The Apprentice,
he's responsible for Lord Sugar's
annual search
to find Britain's
most deluded narcissist!
Please welcome Claude Littner.
APPLAUSE
And so to round one, Home Truths,
where our panellists
each read a statement from the card
in front of them.
Now, to make things harder
they've never seen the card before,
they have no idea what
they'll be faced with
and it's up to the opposing team to
sort the fact from the fiction.
Ade, you're first up.
Right.
"When I broke my neck at school
all I was given was an aspirin."
- David's team. - What happened?
How did you break your neck?
Erm...
LAUGHTER
Don't worry, we can lose
that pause in the edit!
LAUGHTER
As a young man
I was in the gym team.
- Right. - At school.
We were doing a display for...
Whatever you do...
Founder's Day,
something like that you know.
I had to do a somersault
over a box.
A box?
A horse.
- Yeah, yeah, a horse box. - The bit...
- One of the... - It wasn't that big.
- No, a vault. - Yes.
So I jumped over one of those
and was supposed to do a somersault,
but I did one and a half.
And landed on your head.
He's very clever,
isn't he, that one?
So what happened then, Ade?
You came crashing to the floor?
There was a very loud noise.
Your neck breaking made a noise?
Yes. Why wouldn't a neck breaking
make a lot of noise?
- That's a good point.
- Wouldn't you scream anyway?
But the noise would precede
the scream.
But on the way down, on the way
to hitting your neck,
presumably you'd be shouting
out something like, "Ahhh!"
No because actually there's
sometimes a delay before
the pain actually arrives.
Yeah, but there still might be alarm
as you see the chances of you saving
yourself from your neck breaking.
It's like people in an
aeroplane that's crashing,
they're probably screaming
and you don't go,
"Well, you're fine at the moment."
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
So you've hit the ground, you fall
to the floor, what happens then?
- I was in a great deal of pain.
- Was there a gym teacher present?
There was. He was Scottish.
Jock Watt, his name was.
LAUGHTER
- No, no, no. - That was his...
- Jock Watt.
You had a teacher called Jock Watt?
So what did Watt do?
One of the first things he did...
..was he put out his cigarette.
LAUGHTER
- Erm, no...
- On the head of a nearby child.
LAUGHTER
- Watt was there... - Where?
- In the display.
- Watt was in the display?
What? Part of it?
- We're quite small schoolboys.
- Cheer leaders.
- So there's a kind of teacher
to catch you. - Oh, yes.
- Or half catch you, half catch...
- What, somebody dropped you?
You bounce over the thing
and you sort of...
Is that after he dropped you?
Is that when he went...
LAUGHTER
I was carried off
the field of display.
- By what? - By...
LAUGHTER
And taken to the sick bay...
..where I was given an aspirin.
So where was Watt now?
LAUGHTER
I wish his name wasn't Watt.
Why?
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Oh, dear.
So was it evident to you
from the start that you'd
broken your neck?
Er, no.
I suffered a great deal of pain
for very many years...
..and didn't really find out
about the...
..crushed vertebrae...
..until...
Yesterday.
Until a few years after.
So what are you thinking? Are you
thinking that it could be true?
Well, the thing is, I have
been observing him, as I do,
and he doesn't have
full movement of his neck.
Look, look at that.
Wow!
How long have you been
observing him for, Claude?
Yeah, you see.
- What do you think?
- I reckon it's true now because
- of the whole neck thing.
- You think it's true because
- of inhibited neck movement.
- I do, indeed.
We're going to say it's true.
Ade Edmondson,
was it true or was it a lie?
It's...
- ..true. - Yeah!
Yes, it's true, Ade was given
an aspirin for a broken neck.
- Cariad... - Yes. - ..you're next.
OK.
I was sacked from my job in a
call centre for repeatedly using
different accents on the phone.
David's team.
Who were you in a call centre for?
Who did you work for?
I was working for Royal Mail.
- Royal Mail? - Yeah.
And what sort of call do you get,
"Where's my post?"
It was a while ago,
and you used to not have Google
and people used to ring
for postcodes.
What's your favourite accent to do?
So, obviously Welsh is easy, so...
Would you do the accent of
the postcode?
Yeah, that would...
Sometimes you could do that.
- So, OK, I'll be the person
who needs my postcode, OK? - OK.
IMITATES A PHONE RINGING
Yeah.
That does sound like a pre-Google
phone, I'll give you that.
- Hello. - Oh, hello.
- Bore da.
- I need a postcode, please.
- That's nice.
Oh, are you Welsh as well?
THEY SPEAK WELSH
HE CONTINUES TO SPEAK WELSH: Sitting
on panel, moron to your left.
Can you give me
the full address, please?
All right, 14 Mack Avenue.
Now where's that now?
It's just round the corner
from Success Street.
14 Mack Avenue,
Deadsville, Nowhere Town.
- I'm afraid...
- Oh, it is in Wales.
Oh, yes, that's very near Swansea.
The postcode you require is
S for sugar, W for Wilson, eight,
R for Robert, B for Bertie.
That's a lot nearer Wimbledon
than I expected.
SW.
Well, I wasn't always right.
- David, why don't you make
an enquiry? - OK. Hello.
Well, hang on,
you've got to ring her first.
HE IMITATES PHONE RINGING
- That's really good. - The sooner
this is privatised the better!
SHE IMITATES AN AMERICAN ACCENT:
Hi, there, hello. Hi.
Oh, I wasn't expecting
to speak to an American.
No, I know,
it's exciting, we just...
I just came over here
and I got myself a job.
- That's very good, that's very good.
- Thanks.
Were you working nine to five,
by any chance?
- How can I help y'all?
- Well, I would like...
How y'all doing there,
you have a nice day?
It's so hot here in London, I can't
tell you, I'm sweating like a pig.
Well, hang on,
it's not one of those lines, is it?
HE IMITATES AMERICAN ACCENT:
Well, it's real hot here.
I might just get out
of these hot clothes.
I literally didn't say that!
I said sweating like a pig!
In which case, at the other end
you'd hear...
HE IMITATES DAVID: "Ah, really?
"Oh, gosh, well, I certainly
wasn't expecting that."
So, how did they discover that
you were doing these voices?
I didn't know,
but they were listening in to check.
For training purposes.
And so they were
listening in for a week on me.
Look, I have as much of a sense
of fun as the next man, but...
I hope it's not him.
..that's very disrespectful
to your employers.
They were paying me
like 4.60 an hour, I think.
Well, work more hours.
Work more hours, save up,
you could go on a cruise!
So what did they say to you?
What did they say to you?
They took me aside and it was going
to be like Christmas break
and they just said, "We're asking
everyone back after Christmas,
"but we're not asking you."
I should have said, "That's fine,
sugar, I don't even care."
But I didn't.
So what do you think, Claude?
Yeah, you have to say it out loud.
- I think it's a lie.
- You think it's a lie?
They wouldn't wait a week to fire
her. I'd have fired her immediately.
I think it's believable
that you could be that bored
in a phone centre.
I'm leaning towards true.
OK, you're saying it's true?
Cariad, truth or lie?
It's true.
Yes, it's true.
Cariad was sacked from her job
for using different accents.
Our next round is called This Is My,
where we bring on a mystery guest
who has a close connection
to one of our panellists.
Now this week, each of David's team
will claim it's them
that has the genuine connection
to the guest,
and it's up to Lee's team to spot
who's telling the truth.
So please welcome
this week's special guest, Ian.
So, Claude, what is Ian to you?
Well, this is Ian and he's
keeping my motorbike in his shed,
and my wife doesn't know that
I've actually got a motorbike.
Jordan, how do you know Ian?
This is Ian, we used to regularly
drive to a field together
and howl at the moon.
And, David,
what is your relationship with Ian?
This is Ian,
he is the taxi driver who cooked me
a fried egg sandwich
on the engine of his car.
So there we have it.
Lee, where do you want to start?
Well, we could do with one more,
cos none of them
are sounding very convincing.
So, Jordan,
why would you bark at the moon?
Because full moon, you know,
like, it's what you do.
- Oh, so, you were doing it...
- No, no, no, you don't.
You would only do the full moon?
- Yeah, it would be a full moon.
- Where would you do this?
Um, a field.
How old were you?
Four.
My mum was there
and some of her friends.
- How old are you? - I'm 25.
And do you know how old he is?
- Uh... - Roughly?
- I notice you had to glance there,
Jordan, just to check. - 40?
So he's 15 years older than you,
so when you were four,
he was 19, right?
What's your relationship
with this man?
He's, like, my mum's mate.
He's your mum's friend, and
so your mum would howl at the moon?
- Yeah. - Why?
Yeah, my mum loves the moon,
in fact.
It sounds like you
all love the moon.
Yeah. My mum's name's
actually Emmaluna,
because she likes the moon.
Right.
Hang on, what?
She changed her name to that?
Yeah, I think
she was called Emmelina.
And what's his name?
- Um, well, Ian...
- Do you want a minute to think?
- It's Ian Howell. - Ian Howell?
- Ian Howell? - Yeah.
Ian Howell and Emmaluna.
And did you have a moon associated
name at that time?
- I wanted one. - But you weren't old
enough to get your moon name.
- You hadn't earned your moon name.
- Yeah.
They just kept calling you son.
"You're not ready yet, son."
How many people were in the field
howling at the moon?
I don't know, it was dark.
How long are you doing this?
How long are you howling at the
moon for? Were you there all night?
- How long for? - Yeah.
- Just until we felt better.
Better? What was up with you?
It's very... No, it's very
therapeutic howling at the moon.
But, yeah, therapy for what?
What was up with you?
- Well, you know, the month gets
a bit like, "Oh." - Yeah.
- You look at your hands, they've gone
really hairy. - Yeah. Yes.
We'd better howl at the moon.
But I had a, you know, quite
a hippie upbringing, you know.
I was just getting
at one with nature.
So it's getting at one with nature,
it was a bit of a hippie...
Feeling the energy.
We just had a thunder moon,
actually, very powerful.
- You've just had one? - Yeah, recently.
- We have just had one. - Yeah, we did.
I haven't personally had
a thunder moon.
- What's a thunder moon?
- It's not, like, a dish.
"I had thunder moon last night,
it was fantastic."
I had curry last night,
I had thunder moon this morning.
All right,
who else would you like to question?
Claude, why don't
you remind us of...
- Sorry, Claude, yes.
- ..how you know Ian?
- Well, I know Ian because I first met
him about a year ago. - Yeah.
And he came to fix
a leak in my house.
In the course of conversation,
he said that he's got a motorbike,
and actually I've always
wanted a motorbike.
- Right, have you never owned
one before? - No, I haven't. - OK. - No.
So you've never ridden one?
- I probably have on holiday,
but not really. - All right.
- What bike is it? - What bike have
I actually bought? - Yeah.
Well, I'm glad you've asked me that.
It's called... I don't know
how familiar you are with bikes?
- Very familiar.
- Well, let's assume he is. - OK.
- It's called a Fat Boy.
- Oh, good. - Fat Boy?
It's a Harley Davidson.
And when did you take your test?
No, I haven't taken the test.
That's why the bike's in his shed.
- Because you can't drive it?
- Not yet, but I can start it up.
So you bought...
Why haven't you told your wife?
I don't think she'd approve.
Well, do you think this
is not going to give it away
a bit on national television?
Look, sooner or later the truth
must out
and I've chosen tonight.
You've got a Harley Davidson
that you're just happy not to
- ride around. - Well, I'm not happy,
I'm not happy about it.
It's more of a status symbol,
do you know what I mean?
- I've got a Harley. - It's only a
status symbol if it's
outside the shed
and you're sat on it.
It's not a status symbol if it's in
someone's shed and no-one sees it.
You might as well
have bought a rake.
- And you go and visit the bike?
- I do. - To have a look at it?
Well, what I do is I tell my wife
I'm going on a business meeting
and that gives me a few hours
of leeway and I go to the shed.
- And what do you do?
- Start up the bike.
Feel the throbbing.
What do you think
your wife's going to say
when she's watching this programme,
apart from,
"Why did you go on that?"
Well, the thing is that
actually she's in the audience now,
- so it's even worse than...
- She's here tonight? - She is.
Well, this'll be
nice for her to find out.
- How much did you pay for it?
- Well, the thing is I'm glad...
The list price was around Ł17,500.
I said that quickly, so it doesn't
kind of get too much...
And how much did you pay, darling?
I paid a shade under 15 grand,
which I think you'll find is
a very good price.
Why did they give you 2,500 grand
off? Cos you're clearly a rich...
Cos that's the way I do deals.
You're just good at doing deals?
Yeah. That's the way I roll.
Now, when you do come to ride
this bike, what will your attire be?
- Will you be wearing leathers? - Yes,
I've already bought my leathers.
- You wear the leathers
when you go to look at it? - Yeah.
- You don't! - I do.
But the thing is with me,
it's just that I just wanted
to have the wind in my hair.
All right, what about David?
Remind us again, please, David.
This is Ian, he's the
taxi driver who cooked me
a fried egg sandwich
on the engine of his car.
And where were you going
from and to?
I was going from a holiday home
in the west country in Cornwall.
Your holiday home?
No, I temporarily had
legal access to the holiday home.
It's quite a common...
I don't know what
the name of it in contract
law would be, but it's like
when you go on holiday to a
holiday home and it's not your
holiday home, but you're allowed
to be there for a bit
- if you give them money.
- It's called a rental. - Rental!
You're at a rental home.
And then I was leaving it to go
to a railway station.
What station was it?
Bodmin Parkway.
You definitely started the word
Bodmin not knowing how that
was going to end.
- Bodmin Parkway. - And he drove you to
Bodmin Parkway? - Yes.
And when did the fried egg, when did
that come out in conversation?
- Yeah. - When we'd arrived at Bodmin.
- You'd already arrived?
Didn't you have
a train to catch?
- Yes, but the train... - Yes?
- ..had been cancelled. - Ah.
Why? Why was it cancelled?
I can't remember,
but it does sometimes.
Believe me, that can happen.
Could he not just drive
you into Bodmin and find
a cafe and go to a cafe?
I think he's proud of his
egg on engine cooking skills.
How did he do it?
- Do you have a frying pan on
the engine? - No. - What happened?
Aluminium foil.
- So he has this with him...
- Just cracked it in.
Oh, he didn't have any of this with
him. No, no, he mimed it.
And where did he find the egg?
He had it in the car.
He had an egg in the car?
- Oh, that's weird. - I'll tell you
what, he didn't just have one egg,
he had, I think, I would
estimate between three and six.
- Where did he keep these eggs in the
car? - Yeah. - In an egg box.
No, but where was the egg box?
Was it in the boot?
No, I think it
was in a bag in the boot.
A bag in the boot.
Boot, bag, egg box,
eggshell, white, yolk.
You forgot an egg for a minute.
For a man like you, David,
it seems socially awkward to be
standing round the engine
with a bit of tinfoil and...
But isn't that more reason
that it happened?
Any normal people like us would
just go, "You're all right, mate,"
- and walk off. - Yeah.
David, he's stood there,
"Well, I suppose I'd better forget
"the train
and just have an egg sandwich."
Forget the train! I'm waiting.
I've got to wait there an hour.
Yeah, I'm not trying to sort of
forge a new life with
Ian at Bodmin Parkway car park.
Oh, we've got four eggs, that'll
see us through the next day or two.
So, we need an answer. Lee's team,
is Ian Claude's motorbike minder,
Jordan's moonlight mate,
or David's fried egg friend?
What I don't like
about David's story is
the idea that there was another -
I live in the south-west -
that there was another train in
an hour, they're not that frequent.
Really?
Are they like once a day?
There's like three trains
on that line from Bodmin.
You've been done.
- Wow. - OK, what about Claude
and the motorbike?
The idea that
he wouldn't tell his wife
that he's bought a motorbike,
I actually do buy, I buy that bit.
The bit I don't buy is that he
chooses a light entertainment show
that's been nominated for
three BAFTAs - we've never won -
to tell everybody, mainly his wife,
that that is what he's done.
All right, now what about
Jordan and howling at the moon?
I'm liking this story.
I still don't know why. He said it's
to make him feel better, but...
No, I had hippie parents and I
had to do a lot of weird stuff.
What did you have to do?
Oh, we had to go and sit in circles
and chant and shout,
in like communes in Scotland. Yeah.
So I had to weird stuff like that.
Am I the only one that we all had
to go shop lifting at Threshers?
- I'm thinking Jordan. - OK, we'll go...
Shall we go for Jordan?
You're going for Jordan?
Or it could be Claude,
look at his little eyes.
It was just as I said Jordan then,
you were about to turn,
Claude literally, like the evil man
with the white cat.
He literally went, "Ha-ha-ha-ha."
Just because of the
menacing evil smile,
- I think we should change to Claude.
- You're going to go with Claude?
- Claude, the smile of victory.
- All right.
Ian, please reveal
your true identity.
- I'm Ian, and Jordan
and I used to howl at the moon. - Ah!
HE HOWLS
Is he called Ian Howell?
And were you called
Ian Howell before you were
howling at the moon
or did you change your name?
Yes, I was always
called Ian Howell.
I knew it,
weird hippie stuff.
Let's hear the howl.
THEY HOWL
Yes, Ian is Jordan's moonlight mate.
Thank you very much, Ian.
Thank you.
Which brings us to our final round,
Quickfire Lies, and we start with...
..it's Lee.
Having recently got into
Eastern cuisine, this Christmas sees
the launch of my new cookbook...
LAUGHTER
..Lee Mack's Wok Around The Clock.
- David. - Give us some of the recipes
from Wok Around The Clock.
Shall I give you my favourite ones?
- Just your favourite six or seven.
- OK.
Yeah, well, I like
quite simplistic
because believe it or not,
believe it or not...
- Simplistic!
- ..I thought simplistic...
Simplistic, so raw pork.
So, sweet-and-sour pork balls
is one of my specialities.
How would you cook your
sweet-and-sour pork balls?
Well, I'll tell you
exactly how I would cook
my sweet-and-sour pork balls -
for Ł9.99 you can find out.
Did you go to the publishers
with this idea?
I went to Penguin because
they're the only book publishers
I've heard of.
How keen were they? Because I have
to say, if I was a publisher
- and you came to me... - Yeah.
..I wouldn't be interested.
- Well, ironically, Penguin didn't
p-p-p-pick it up straight away. - Yes!
Did you work in
conjunction with a proper chef?
- Of course I was helped a little bit.
- Who? By whom?
It's a friend of mine,
works at the Chinese restaurant.
- What's the name of this person?
- You wouldn't know him.
- Well, give it a try. - Steve.
Steve Jenkins.
I've been going into the Chinese
restaurant a lot recently,
and I've been really
sort of learning about it
and savouring the dishes,
and I keep saying,
"Steve, this is fantastic,
what is this?"
And then he says
something in Chinese,
which I don't understand,
and then I said...
Steve Jenkins is Chinese?
He was adopted when he was
a kid by a Chinese family
and taken to China,
but he was an English baby, yeah.
This is a true story. They took...
They took Steve Jenkins.
They adopted him.
Even though he was a baby,
he was known as Steve.
Obviously not.
Then, he was called Baby Steve.
- So this Chinese couple
adopt Baby Steve... - Stephen.
His full name,
he's called Steve Jenkins.
And they don't change his name.
But they couldn't change his name,
could they, cos he was...
They continue to call him
Steve Jenkins.
But he was clearly an English baby.
They knew he was going
to grow up looking western.
Was he the only
Steve Jenkins in his school?
He was actually, yes.
I think we should concentrate
more on my ability to cook
and less on my ability
to understand the basic systems
of adopted children
and taking them to China.
What was the hardest recipe
to perfect?
The hardest one to perfect
was definitely
the beef in oyster sauce,
with chilli.
How would you go about cooking that?
Well, first of all,
I will get my wok.
- Yes. - Very bold of you.
- Yeah, so I get my wok down
from my wok shelf. - Yeah.
- Put it down.
- You've got a wok shelf?
- Wok shelf, yes.
- How many woks do you own?
- About seven. - Seven woks!
How many woks have you got?
One.
- Well, that's why you haven't got
a book out at Christmas, mate. - Yeah.
So I light the burner like that,
"Whoosh." That's the noise.
And I heat the oil,
put the oil down,
peanut oil actually, don't use
olive oil, peanut oil.
- So I put the peanut oil...
- Sounds delicious.
The trick with a wok is not to put
the oil at the bottom
of the pan, it's to dribble it round
the edge. You know, the same way
- as you do a Toilet Duck? - Yeah.
All the way round the edge and watch
it slightly go down.
And the publisher said,
"Probably don't use that analogy."
So put it round the edge,
let it all sink down to the bottom
like that, yeah. Give it a
good spinning round like that.
And this is peanut oil, even though
an increasing number of people
in Britain are allergic
to peanuts.
- Absolutely, but I do...
- Doesn't bother you?
No, I make it very clear to those
people on the front of the book.
I say, "If you have a peanut
allergy, you are not welcome."
And I do that like that,
throw it in, you flash fry it...
HE HISSES
I'm there.
HE CONTINUES TO HISS
You're throwing in three
or four different ingredients,
there's different versions of it.
I'm going to go with the one
with lots of greens,
lots of broccoli, lots of carrots,
a few sesame seeds,
you're throwing it in. The thing
is to feel the pan, feel it!
Become the pan, become one
with the pan!
You flick it up like that,
stir it round.
That's when you add the sauce,
that's when you've got to add
the sauce, the oyster sauce,
but it's home-made oyster sauce.
"How do you make
home-made oyster sauce?"
I'll tell you exactly how you make
home-made oyster - you get some
water from the tap,
you soak your oysters in it.
Yes, you do use oysters.
You soak them for four weeks in
water until the water goes black.
How does it go black? You get your
squid ink, you squid ink it in,
you mix it up. Mash, down, in,
get it really liquidy.
It's on the turn, but it's not
gone off, you've got to get it
just on the turn you put it in,
you whisk it round.
It's not hissing any more,
cos that's stopped.
It's simmering away like that,
it all settles down
and you pour it onto the pan
like that.
9.99, the book's yours.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
I want that.
David, what are you thinking?
It was very entertaining,
but was it... Well, I say very.
Was it true?
No, no, it wasn't true.
Do you need a little time
to discuss this with your team?
No, no, no.
Well, firstly, it wasn't
true off the card to start with
because there's no way Lee
would bring out that sort of book.
- Why?
- I've met him, it's evident.
But why? You don't
know everything about me, David.
He then went on to make it
less plausible by the fact that
your collaborator in this book
is a man called Steve Jenkins,
who was adopted as a baby in
this country, taken back to China...
- Not for long.
- No, for his whole childhood. - No, no.
- He said they came back to Britain.
- Yeah, but when he was an adult.
- Oh, when he's an adult. - Yeah.
- Yeah, otherwise he'd have been able
- to speak English now, wouldn't he?
- How did you write a book with a man
that only spoke Cantonese?
Well, we had an interpreter.
Chinese fella called Brian Smith.
I think you're incredible, man.
Blown me away.
Incredible as in not credible?
So we're saying it's a lie?
Well, the audience are
on tenterhooks.
Lee, was it the truth?
See there's a slight part
of me now thinking...
"I could actually bring this out."
It's a lie.
It's a lie, Lee hasn't written
a cookbook called
Lee Mack's Wok Around The Clock.
BUZZER SOUNDS
And that noise signals time is up,
it's the end of the show.
I can reveal that David's team
have won by four points to nil.
Thanks for watching, we'll see
you next time, good night.
