[Thunder rumbling]
JACK:
Make a wish.
MEG: I wish that I could be
more like you.
It just that I don't
fit in my skin anymore.
It feels all wrong and creepy.
I'm stupid, like the twins said,
and everyone hates me.
Oh, honey,
you're not remotely stupid.
And nobody hates you.
I'm stupid.
You just take a moment
and think.
You do things in your own way,
in your own time.
And that's what
I love about you so much.
That's what makes you
so special.
And whenever you need me,
I'll be right here.
DANA: Meg!
Meg, come in, honey.
It's late.
ME G:
Dad left us.
No word.
Just left.
Fort?
Come on, Fort.
Hey, buddy.
- DENNYS: Mom! He's cheating!
- SAND Y: Whoo-hoo!
My mom was weirdly confident
that Dad would be back.
I tried to believe her,
but after a year, it gets hard.
Hey, Mom.
Hey, hon.
Both my parents were considered
brilliant scientists.
He was working on some
classified project
before he disappeared.
I wished more than anything
that my dad would come back.
First.
Mom, Meg's talking
to herself again.
I am not.
She's always doing this stupid
stuff like talking to herself.
Sandy and Dennys
seemed to adjust, though.
They were normal,
happy, obnoxious brothers.
I'm nothing but a slave
around here.
Geek.
Brainless.
Mutant.
Human hair ball.
Nerd sister.
CHARLES WALLACE: Teratoma.
Hey, that's a coincidence.
And then there's
Charles Wallace.
When Meg said,
"Human hair ball,"
I started reading "teratoma,"
which is a human hair ball.
Actually, it's a human
hair and teeth ball,
if you want to get technical.
He was brilliant.
But he would never talk
outside the family.
Mom said he was special.
Well, what she said, actually,
is that he was somehow new.
I had no idea how new.
These pathways between neurons.
That's "N-E-U-R-O-N-S."
And I'll be taking off points
for misspellings.
Transmit signals.
[Crow caws]
There are three principal areas
of the brain.
The brain stem.
The cerebellum, divided
into left and right hemispheres.
And the cerebrum.
Margaret Murry.
You seem to feel
you don't need this review.
So why don't you tell us
about the brain?
The human brain is composed of
differentiated nerve tissues
arranged in a series
of structures
with specialized functions.
Is that enough?
Please, go on.
It is the cerebrum,
and not the cerebellum,
as you incorrectly stated,
that is divided into left
and right hemispheres.
The left hemisphere being
primarily concerned with...
That's enough.
Report to detention.
Was I wrong?
Now, young lady.
Pay attention.
Everybody watching?
TOGETHER:
Yes.
Okay.
Which continent is this?
Charles Wallace?
What about you?
I'm sure you could tell us
if you wanted to.
No?
Okay.
- Isabel.
- Africa.
- [Shrill ringing]
- MRS. WHATSIT: Charles Wallace.
Charles Wallace.
Meet me at the haunted house.
So, Mr. Porter says
that you were...
Well, the word he used
was "belligerent."
He's so condescending.
And he gets things wrong
all the time.
He called the cerebrum
the cerebellum.
Well, you're old enough to know
that adults don't know
everything.
And you're old enough to know
that when one adult
disappoints you,
you can't take it out
on all the rest.
Lots of kids' parents
split up, Maggie.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
1, hydrogen.
2, helium.
3, lithium.
Maggie?
It's Meg.
Sorry. Yeah.
I'm sorry, Meg.
Talking helps.
You don't really care.
I do.
I got into this job
because I do care.
No, not like...
Not like...
Your dad did.
Does.
Meg.
Oh, poor baby.
The baby's crying.
[Bell rings]
[Students talking
and laughing]
Hey!
Hey, buddy.
Hey, moron!
Say something!
Shut up, Eric.
What's his problem?
You a complete and total freak
like your sister?
Your daddy was embarrassed.
He had a kid who was 6
and can't talk yet.
Ho-ho!
You're dead now!
You are such a loser, Eric.
- Well, she's...
- I don't want to hear it!
Go home and grow up.
I'm sorry about
my little brother.
Takes after the reform-school
side of the family.
You okay?
Yeah. Thanks.
[Thinking]
Bye.
I like him, Meg.
I can read his thoughts,
like yours and Mom's.
Really?
Yeah.
How do you do it?
I mean, how can you read us?
I don't really know.
You just tell me.
Just everything about you
tells me.
Why don't you read the twins?
It's because
they don't need me as much.
I hate it when people tease you.
If you would just talk to people
outside the family,
people wouldn't think
that you were so stra...
Unusual.
But I am.
I know.
Mom, Meg was fighting.
- They started it.
- You started it.
You weren't even there.
Dad would get what it's like
having her for a sister.
- Dad would be on my side.
- Enough.
Yeah, I got it!
Oh, I got it.
Stop it.
Find anything today?
Meg, sweetie, the school called.
Again.
It's just tough.
You know, Meg, one day
you'll find a happy medium.
[Thunder rumbling]
[Caws]
MRS. WHO:
Charles Wallace?
Charles Wallace?
We are with you.
[Tapping]
[Crow caws]
[Caws]
Meg.
Meg.
[Cawing]
Charles Wallace?
CHARLES WALLACE:
Hey, Meg.
Knew you'd be down.
Of course you did.
Oh, man, there was
this huge black crow
right outside my window.
Yeah, I know.
She's cool.
Here.
There's some cocoa for you
right over there on the stove.
Okay. Wait.
What do you mean, she's cool?
Cocoa.
Is there enough for me?
Sure.
You knew she'd want some.
Nearly midnight.
Couldn't sleep.
No, me either.
Me either.
Ever wonder if people try to
talk to you
when you're sleeping
in your head?
Not really.
Why don't you tell me
more about it?
It's okay.
It's not paranoid schizophrenia.
My head's just busy
with different stuff.
You'll tell me if it gets
too busy, right?
How about you make me
a sandwich?
Magic jam.
Poof!
You're a sandwich.
Harry Houdini.
Ha ha ha.
Four plates, huh?
You expecting Sandy or Dennys?
Well, you never know
who might just drop by.
[Thunder rumbles]
So, after you went to bed,
Max Hillerman's mother called.
She said you sprained his wrist?
He's an idiot.
It's true.
He is.
Well, very possibly.
Certainly his mother is.
[Thunder crashes]
He was making fun
of Charles Wallace.
Charles Wallace will talk
outside the family
when he's ready.
It's hard for Meg, too.
I know.
I'm no good at hiding
what I feel.
Well, that's good and bad,
right?
No, it's bad.
No one likes me.
I don't even like me.
Meg, many people like you.
Personally, I love you.
Of course, we are a lot alike.
Me? Like you?
Yeah.
You're, like, perfect.
You're brilliant and smart
and beautiful.
I mean, why can't you
find Daddy if he's not...
Meg, if I had any idea...
Why doesn't he contact us?
Maybe he can't.
I should introduce you both
to Mrs. Whatsit.
Mrs. Who?
No, that's the other one.
What?
No. Whatsit.
What whatsit?
I just told you.
Hang on.
Who is Mrs. Whatsit?
Is this the person that's been
talking to you in your head?
Is she one of
your imaginary friends?
No. She's just as real
as you and me.
Maybe even realer.
Ah, I think she's come for me.
Come for you?
What are you talking about?
[Thunder crashes]
Fort's worried.
That's not Fort's worried bark.
It's more like his...
Jack?
Jack?
- I'm scared.
- It's all right, Meg.
Fortinbras
wouldn't let anyone...
[Crow cawing]
[Fort whimpers]
Where did you come from?
Mrs. Whatsit.
Good to see you,
Charles Wallace.
How'd you do that?
Charles Wallace?
You're talking to her.
What are you doing out
on such a wild night?
Wild nights are my glory.
I caught the most marvelous
downdraft.
And now I'm here
with you lovely, lovely people.
And... [Sniffs]
Cocoa!
Thank you, dear.
Meg.
Mmm.
Mmm. Ahh!
Here.
The fourth plate.
Would there be
a caviar sandwich also?
No.
There might be some tuna fish.
That's just not the same, is it?
I'm happy to finally meet you,
Dr. Murry.
Why?
I think that's a bit off.
This is just a flying visit,
you know.
Just to say not to worry
no matter what happens.
What do you mean?
I get so hungry in this shape.
Oh, that one's bruised.
Now, what did you mean?
Charles Wallace said
you'd come for him?
And remember, Dana, there is
such a thing in the real world
as a tesseract.
And it works.
MEG:
What's a tesseract?
What do you mean, it works?
Come back here!
Where's Jack?
What do you know?
[Crow caws]
CHARLES WALLACE:
Mom, she's okay.
She's on our side.
Side?
Since when are there sides?
Mom, come on. We have to go
to soccer practice.
- Don't forget the lunches, okay?
- I won't.
Okay. Good.
Okay.
I'm running the kids
to soccer practice.
No one goes out,
and no one comes in, right?
MEG: Mom, last night she said
something about a tesseract.
And if that Mrs. Whoever
comes anywhere near the house,
I want you to dial 911, right?
But, Mom, what's a tesseract?
I said stay inside.
I wonder if she's there
right now.
You wonder if who's where?
Mrs. Whatsit.
At the haunted house.
Go get changed.
Come on.
So, what's a tesseract?
I saw Mom looking it up
on the Internet.
I don't know.
[Crow cawing]
[Squawking]
- Oh!
- [Gasps]
Oh, man.
You scared us.
Don't do that.
Meg?
Meg.
Yeah.
Hang on.
Last night you were talking
about a tesseract.
Meg.
Yeah?
Well, that's not Mrs. Whatsit.
Well, what is it, then?
It's a crow.
Oh.
Meg.
What?
What is it?
Mom's coming back.
Chess!
Good idea.
You know I don't like pineapple.
Hello?
Hey.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Mom.
Great day, isn't it?
Hey.
Look who's here.
What's he doing here?
Hey.
Hi.
I was just wondering if you
were okay after yesterday.
My idiot brother.
Hi.
I'm Charles Wallace Murry.
Hey.
Everyone says your
brother doesn't talk.
He doesn't.
I mean, he does.
But just to the family, usually.
Really?
You're Calvin O'Keefe.
I know.
What are you doing here?
I'm not quite sure.
I was called.
It was like a compulsion.
Stay and have dinner with us.
Okay?
Charles Wallace.
Mom says we should feel free to
invite our friends over anytime.
I know. I'm sure he's got
better things to do.
And you hardly know him.
But everyone knows about Calvin.
You're the best basketball
player in the district.
And you're really smart.
And Mrs. Judalee
from the post office
thinks you're the only O'Keefe
to ever amount to anything.
You know, I think I liked it
better when you didn't talk.
Calvin likes me talking to him.
You know, I'm not sure why,
but I kind of do.
Meg, the stove.
Would you...
It's Calvin O'Keefe, Mom.
He's staying for dinner.
Sure. Yeah.
He's talking in front of...
Calvin.
How do you do, Dr. Murry?
Very pleased to meet you.
Well, I'm very pleased
to meet you, too, Calvin.
Know how to play Boggle?
Charles Wallace is gonna win.
He always wins.
Fare.
Fire.
Fear.
Takes. Stake. Fake.
SAND Y: In that game against
Northern Regional,
you were awesome.
CALVIN:
Thanks.
That move, when you ducked
under that 6'5" guard
then spun around and shot
that 3-pointer was so awesome.
Teak.
Area.
Strait.
Freak.
Freakiest.
Time.
How did you do that?
I'm really sorry you haven't
heard from Dr. Murry.
Mom even hired
a private investigator.
Yeah, fat lot of good he's done.
You're a neurobiologist,
right, Dr. Murry?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
MRS. WHATSIT:
Charles Wallace.
Charles Wallace.
We're here.
Starfish.
MRS. WHATSIT:
Show him.
Show him your father.
DANA:
Oh, God. If I can find it.
Things have been a little bit
of a mess around here lately.
There's no time.
It's on bilateral symmetry.
There's no time.
You have to see more stuff
about Dad. Come on.
[Baby laughing]
DENNYS:
Come back.
JACK:
Whoa!
Oh! Good for you!
You did it.
[Laughter]
And this was
just before I was born.
Right, Meg?
Mm-hmm.
Your family.
You're all something.
I don't know what.
We're mostly just ordinary.
No, I don't think so.
Not as ordinary as you think.
- Whoa!
- Whoa.
Oh, good for you.
You did it.
Meg, look.
Charles Wallace.
What's going on?
It can't be.
Charles Wallace.
Who is that?
Charles Wallace. Meg.
It's time.
He needs you.
What is this?
Who needs us?
Your father, of course.
Come to the star-watching rock.
Now.
MRS. WHO:
And you, too, Calvin.
Mom?
No, Meg.
It was a message for us.
This is it, kids.
Get the coats.
Hurry up.
DANA:
Where are you two going?
- Where are you guys going?
- Outside.
It's your bedtime,
Charles Wallace.
Mrs. Whatsit's gonna
help us find Daddy!
What's going on?
This is nuts!
It's about Dad.
Mrs. Whatsit doesn't mean to
scare us.
Well, she is!
What is this?
What's going on?
Why do you want me to come?
What's the star-watching rock?
And what is that?
Aah!
Up you get!
- What?
- What's happening?
Excellent.
Nothing we can't deal with.
But first,
just one more little thing!
Hey!
My dears, hold on to who you are
first and alone.
And this is very important.
Hold on to each other.
Why?
It will keep you undamaged.
Undamaged?
And alive.
Alive?
MEG:
This is incredible.
CHARLES WALLACE:
Don't let go!
Ugh!
Wow.
Hold on.
Don't let go.
Whoa!
Help! Meg!
Aah!
MRS. WHATSIT:
This never lasts too long.
It's just a flower storm.
Quick!
Under the trees.
"We are such stuff
as dreams are made of."
Shakespeare, "The Tempest."
Oh!
Hello, Who!
Hi, Mrs. Who.
Nice to meet you.
Oh.
And this is Meg.
And this is Calvin.
I didn't plan on Calvin.
I called Calvin.
You called me?
Who are you?
[Speaking German]
"I do not know everything.
Still, many things
I understand."
Goethe.
Would you tell her to stop that?
Who and I are still young.
Sometimes she finds it easier
to quote others
than to work out what to say
on her own.
Would you just tell me
where we are
and what you know
about my father?
Meg, you burn brightly.
You are angry as well as afraid,
and that is good.
MEG:
What's that?
It's a fire-fruit.
Wait one minute.
Where are we?
Uriel.
It's the third star
of the planet Malik
in the spiral nebula
Messier 101.
Did I miss the spaceship part?
You know, jump into hyperspace.
Warp speed.
All that stuff.
Spaceships are shiny toys
for infant civilizations.
The ultimate starship is here.
What was that
that happened to us?
I thought I was dying.
The tesseract.
Tesseract?
Parts of the universe
are connected in ways
that humans
have never before imagined.
The tesseract acts as a gateway
to those connections.
Gateway?
It's like a wrinkle.
You see,
if this insect wanted to travel
across my left hand
to my right hand,
it would be very far for her.
But now.
You see?
She is there.
It's a wrinkle in time.
A tesseract.
Okay.
Yeah, I think I get it.
I think.
Mrs. Who would say,
"The last step of any journey
may be the first step
of an even greater adventure."
Pick some flowers, children.
- Flowers?
- Why? Why flowers?
Where are you?
The blue ones behind you.
Go on.
That's it.
Pick some.
Children.
Don't be afraid.
Come.
It's me.
Mrs. Whatsit?
I can't go changing my name
every time I change my shape.
Come on.
Get on.
Hold on.
Ready?
Whoa!
Whoa.
Aah!
[Indistinct singing]
What's that music?
MRS. WHATSIT:
Look down there.
Can you translate,
Charles Wallace?
Is it about joy?
Yes, my boy.
Well done.
[Gasping]
Meg.
Meg, I can't breathe.
MRS. WHATSIT:
The flowers.
Hold them to your faces.
Take a deep breath.
This is nuts.
But it works.
Good.
Children, come.
Whatsit, we haven't much time.
Come.
I don't like it.
- Nor do we.
- [Faint pounding]
You might think of it
as a plague of evil.
A lack of will and compassion.
A breaking.
A diminishing that could infect
the universe if not stopped.
I've heard that sound
in my head before.
It sends something to me.
It always scares me.
Your father is somewhere
behind that darkness.
He's there?
Whoa.
Mrs. Which?
Children?
Get rid of them at once.
Meg?
I really miss Mom and Dad.
I know you do.
Me too.
MRS. WHATSIT:
Dr. Murry has little time.
You just stay here
and go to sleep, okay?
I'll be right back.
MRS. WHICH:
Children, Whatsit.
Someone is needed immediately
on Camazotz to bring out Murry
and many others.
And I cannot believe
it is those three.
Did you know that this
Charles Wallace creature
was still an embryo, Whatsit?
Yes, I knew.
And yes,
his powers are undeveloped.
But they are considerable.
And the other two.
Mere primitives.
MRS. WHATSIT: Well,
Meg has the power within her
if she'd only learn to value it.
She's untamed.
Undisciplined. Emotional.
Oh, yes.
Isn't it wonderful?
MRS. WHATSIT:
We believe
Dr. Murry may be able to do
for his children
what he cannot do for himself.
And that other one.
Calvin.
How do you explain him?
These humans have been
my study, Which.
They need one another.
It is what keeps
their world spinning.
It has all been mismanaged.
Meg.
Meg.
Hey.
Where have you been?
I was worried about you.
I was gonna go look for you.
But I couldn't
leave him here alone.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
No, I'm fine.
Sorry.
I overheard the ladies talking.
And?
If it gets any weirder, Calvin,
my head is gonna turn
inside out.
They think that Charles Wallace
is an embryo with potential.
You and I
are as good as used Kleenex.
"Primitives," they said.
Yeah, so what do you think
they're gonna do?
Get rid of us?
I don't think
they've decided yet.
Oh, jeez, Calvin.
I feel like I'm being held
hostage in some wacko's dream.
There's no one I'd rather
be held hostage with.
Now watch, children.
You have to see
where you came from
to know where you are going.
Your galactic cluster.
Talk about a visual aid.
Whoa.
That's the solar system.
Yes.
A solar system which is,
in itself,
just a tiny speck in a universe
incomprehensibly vast.
In which you may think
you are as insignificant
as a grain of sand.
But for good or ill, you
have become involved in matters
that will make you see just how
significant you truly are.
Now look.
There's your Earth.
Do you see it?
Um...
[Clears throat]
Actually, that's Mars.
That darkness.
It's on Earth, too?
Did it just come?
No.
It's been there
a great many years.
It's why your planet
is such a troubled one.
Yes.
And soon your planet
could be engulfed.
Well, what about Daddy?
Your father is on Camazotz.
Ooh, hideous name.
It is a planet which fell
a long time ago.
Your father was vulnerable
to the power of the darkness
because he stumbled
upon the tesseract
without understanding it.
Well, what can we do if
my father can't even fight it?
Meg, some of the most
brilliant battles have been won
by the most unlikely warriors.
Especially on Earth.
Warriors?
Well, there have been many.
Michelangelo.
And Madame Curie.
And Jane Austen
and Mother Teresa
and Dr. Martin Luther King.
Einstein.
Shakespeare.
And Gandhi.
And Bach.
St. Francis Assisi.
And me.
Nicely done.
Well, you can't send him
into the darkness alone.
He's only 6.
That is why we sent
for the three of you.
But beware.
Only warriors who go with grace
and understanding
can have the strength to do it.
Well, I'm smart,
but I'm no Madame Curie.
Happy Medium?
The Happy Medium.
We're going in there?
You and Calvin need to go
in there.
MRS. WHATSIT:
Let's go.
Come on, children.
The Happy Medium works best
from within.
Come on.
Oh. Come on.
You don't have to be
afraid here.
The Happy Medium
is really very jolly.
You'll like her.
I stopped by to see him
60 years ago.
And I laughed so hard,
I nearly split my side.
I mean, my human form
was literally
coming apart at the seams.
60 years ago?
How old are you?
2,379, 152,497 years,
8 months, 2 days,
according to your calendar.
Which we know isn't
very accurate.
Come. Join me.
Well, you're holding up well.
Oh, Calvin, thank you.
You are such a gentleman.
Come.
Okay, you two.
To the Happy Medium.
It's quite an honor
to be asked on this mission.
I mean, it's because
of my verbalizing
and materializing so well.
Of course, we can't take credit
for our talents, can we?
No, it's how we use them
that counts.
Are we there yet?
Meg, you have to learn patience
if you want to find your father.
MEG:
What's that light?
MRS. WHATSIT:
They're glowworms.
[Laughs]
Glowworms?
They feed off laughter.
HAPPY MEDIUM:
Will it ever quit?
[Laughing]
Oh, this universe!
Will it ever quit?
Oh, my spleen!
My liver as well.
But oh!
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.
Oh, what do you...
Oh! Come in.
Come in!
Oh.
Welcome!
Welcome!
You must be Meg.
No.
I'm Calvin.
This...
Is Meg.
Oh, tickled.
Tickled to meet you.
Oh.
Hello, Mrs. Which.
H.M.
Oh, Mrs. Whatsit.
What a lovely form
you've taken today.
Hello, friend.
Is that a man or a woman?
Oh.
I'm neither.
I'm above all of that stuff.
No.
I'm a happy medium.
H.M., we have come because
you can show us something
that no one else can.
Yes.
How one creature
can challenge the darkness
which even now threatens
their home planet.
Yes.
But you don't want to see that
right now.
You'd like to see
something funny.
There's so many things to see.
Oh, like this one!
Come here!
Look at this!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, that's good.
I know I shouldn't laugh.
Really.
But...
H.M., we are here...
To show them the darkness.
CALVIN:
It's a star.
Yes.
Watch closely.
It died.
Yes.
But for a reason.
The darkness was defeated
for a while.
That happened to you.
CALVIN:
You were a star?
I so loved being a star.
And you can never be one again?
Dear Whatsit.
You gave up a form
which you loved so dearly
in order to defeat the darkness.
How can evil ever prevail
when there is such courage
in the world?
You have much
to be proud of, Whatsit.
What?
What's with all the long faces?
Look at the moping!
Oh! Your face is so long
I could pole-vault with it!
What did you have for breakfast?
A big bowl of misery flakes
with misery milk?
The point, my dear,
sweet children,
is that you can win the battle
against the darkness sometimes.
That's what you needed to see.
Knowing that can help you
if you decide to go to Camazotz.
Wait.
Could I see my mom?
Sure.
And Calvin's mom, too?
I don't think
that's a very good idea.
I mean, she's probably
off boating or something.
Yes, I think perhaps it's not...
No, no.
I can find it. Here.
Tuning in
to the O'Keefe residence.
Who the heck do you think you
are, God's gift to cockroaches?
You passive-aggressive
little brat, look at me!
You have the nerve
to give me lip?
You look at me
when I'm talking to you!
You listen to me.
I hate you!
I'm sorry.
No.
It's good you know.
She's probably
a wonderful dancer.
So, let's tune in
the Murry house.
Jack.
Oh.
Another home weighed down
by the darkness.
Let's go.
Well, let's do something.
We have to do something.
Oh, finally.
CALVIN:
Yeah.
It's time to do something.
How about the hokey-pokey?
Oh, poor dear,
we've exhausted her.
We have to go to Camazotz
to find my father.
Come, come.
Careful.
Remember, children.
When you arrive
we will be watching you.
But you won't see us,
and we cannot help you.
Only when you have done
everything in your power
will these be able to help you.
Mrs. Whatsit?
Are you scared for us?
A little.
I'm a little bit.
If you weren't afraid to do what
you did when you were a star,
how can you be afraid
for us now?
I was afraid.
Well, I'm not afraid.
Don't be arrogant,
Charles Wallace.
Only a fool is not afraid.
Come along, children.
We will be watching you.
And remember,
stay together, children.
Remember, stay together!
[Thunder crashes]
- Ow!
- Aah!
MEG:
Hang on.
This is Camazotz?
[Roaring]
What is that?
What is it?
Run!
Go! Go!
Keep going!
Quick!
Up this way!
Come on.
What is that?
Go! Go! Go!
- Run!
- This is not cool!
CHARLES WALLACE:
What should we do?
[Roaring fades]
[Ball bouncing rhythmically]
Strange time to play outside.
Hi.
Why are you playing now?
It's the hour to play.
You play in the dark?
Wow.
It's the rhythm
I heard in my head.
Weird.
Excuse me.
We're looking for our dad.
[Ball bouncing arrhythmically]
Billy!
MAN:
It is the hour to play.
It is the hour to play.
To the car, please.
Just the boy.
MEG: Charles Wallace,
what's going on?
I don't have a clue.
I can't get through to anyone.
Not even a little bit.
CALVIN:
Can you imagine? No sunshine?
Why else would they call it
a must-see movie?
I don't know.
Look, you have to go see it.
Do we really have to...
You have to go.
It looks dumb.
What's with all this "lt" stuff?
You know they take attendance
at these things.
They have that list.
Why else would they call it
a must-see movie?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You examiners?
Why?
Your clothes.
Yeah?
What about our clothes?
Charles Wallace.
We haven't had any operations
in our section for years.
None? Hmm.
We do everything
we're supposed to.
We really do.
- Our section's famous for it.
- Yeah, it is.
Hey, so where's headquarters?
You mean Central Central
Intelligence?
Well, that looks pretty central.
How could you not know that?
If you were examiners,
you would've been sent
by Central Central Intelligence.
I think they're foreigners.
Foreigners.
If It finds out,
you'll be in trouble.
Big trouble.
Are you?
Hey, who's asking
the questions here?
I don't believe you're supposed
to ask questions, yeah?
Charles Wallace,
what is wrong with you?
Let's go.
MAN:
S 16.
T49.
F33.
B 19.
Q30.
Y91.
Excuse me.
So, what's the procedure here?
You fill out the "A" form
and the "B" form.
Put the "A" form
into the "S" slot.
Q52.
P41.
And wait.
I got to say,
you were a lot of help.
I feel him.
Dad?
Yeah.
Distract them
while I try to read him.
P41.
D6.
Hi.
What?
Sorry.
I was just wondering
what you're here for.
V72.
They said I need an adjustment.
What kind of adjustment?
I don't know.
L62.
T7.
Those are the ones.
Those are the foreigners.
R63.
B 11.
Come.
This way.
I'm feeling him this way.
J36.
WOMAN:
Relax. It is in control.
[Woman sobbing]
Submit to lt.
It will take care of your needs.
I'm reading him this way.
WOMAN:
Enough! Just stop!
Happiness is yours
if you obey lt.
Give over to lt.
It was.
It is.
It will be.
Surrender to lt.
[Door opens]
It is your friend.
There is nothing without lt.
This is stupid.
They're gonna see us.
I know I'm not supposed to
do this.
But stay here.
I'll be right back.
No.
We're not supposed to split up.
We have to stay...
We have to stay together.
Calvin.
Hey, ladies.
Hey. Look.
There's no point
in resisting lt.
Stay still.
[Metal clanging]
Calvin's here.
MAN:
Do not resist lt.
Stubborn, aren't you?
[Mumbling]
Pass the ball.
Calvin.
Calvin.
[Gasps]
[Crowd cheering]
- Calvin, this isn't real!
- [Whistle blows]
Calvin.
Calvin!
- Calvin!
- [Gasps]
Could have had a triple-double.
I could have had
a triple-double.
They drugged you
with your own dream.
Oh.
I heard all these noises.
It really hurts.
I can't hold on much longer.
I can barely hold on now.
Nice coats, by the way.
Thanks.
They're all the rage.
Dad's in there.
I feel him.
He's not here.
No, no, no, no!
Come on!
Meg.
Look.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy.
Daddy?
Daddy!
No!
We need you!
Daddy!
We have to get to him!
Daddy?
Meg.
- Daddy!
- Meg!
Dad!
Meg, it's just an image!
He could be anywhere.
Calm down.
Think.
What would Mrs. Whatsit do?
CALVIN:
What is it, Meg?
CHARLES WALLACE:
What do you see? What?
Meg!
- Meg!
- Where are you?
Daddy.
Daddy?
Huh? Megsie?
Daddy.
Oh, Dad.
It's really you.
No. No.
You're just a dream.
Dad.
No. No.
This isn't real.
No, Daddy.
It's me.
It's really me.
It's Meg.
No, Dad.
Dad. Dad.
It's me.
It's really me.
Look, I came all the way
to find you, Dad.
Remember me?
And Mom and the twins?
How could it be you?
How could you be here?
Dad!
Daddy.
How could you be here?
Oh.
It's way too crazy
to explain now.
But we have to get you
out of here.
Come on.
"We"?
Yeah.
Me and Charles Wallace.
Charles Wallace?
He's here?
He's with Calvin.
Who?
Calvin O'Keefe.
You know, from school.
Never mind.
You know all about
the tesseract, right?
The tesseract.
God, I'm sorry.
That doesn't matter.
We have Mrs. Who's glasses.
Mrs. What?
No. Who.
Mrs. Who.
I can't explain it all
to you now.
But we have to go.
Come on.
I'm afraid
my leg is broken, Meg.
Just lean on me, then.
My God.
You've gotten so tall.
Here. Come on.
Put these on.
What?
Trust me.
Come on.
Put them on.
Come on.
Keep walking.
Meg.
That's a wall.
I know.
Just walk.
Come on.
Trust me.
Daddy!
- Daddy! Dad!
- Charles Wallace.
Be careful of his leg.
Oh, Charles Wallace, I never
thought I'd see you again.
What happened?
I couldn't see you.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
Calvin.
Hi.
Dad?
Charles Wallace.
At last.
No.
You get away from him.
- Oh!
- Jack, oh, I'm so sorry.
Listen.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you out here?
Leave him alone!
But they're what this is
all about, Jack.
Or at least he is.
Why are your eyes red?
It was a late night.
This is an amazing place.
Isn't it, Charles Wallace?
What It has created here
is a new order.
All grief, all illness,
all conflict banished.
I was selected by It
to serve It's vision
and have been dazzled by lt.
It has seen that you are even
more special, Charles Wallace.
Charles Wallace, do not
let him into your thoughts.
That's how he controls
your mind.
I don't control anything.
I help my people
achieve understanding
by serving and being the voice
of It to further the cause.
To make everybody
in the universe one and alike.
Your abilities, now,
Charles Wallace,
are something
altogether different.
Now, you leave my son
out of this.
You're powerful!
Magnificent!
I mean, that's why you're here.
Don't listen to him.
I'm not afraid of him, Daddy.
I think maybe you should be.
MEG: Charles Wallace,
remember what Mrs. Which said.
- You don't know everything.
- Only a fool is not afraid.
I'm gonna make you
let Daddy leave.
I'm gonna figure out
what you are
and make you not be it anymore.
No.
Charles Wallace.
Don't touch her.
Whatever you say, Jack.
- No.
- Aah!
Meg!
Calvin, help!
What's happening?
[Laughing]
Don't listen to him!
You and I need to talk without
all these interruptions.
Don't listen to him!
Charles Wallace!
Charles Wallace!
Because they can't possibly
understand us.
Now, do you know what I loved
about your house
- back on Earth?
- Don't listen to him!
Especially your room?
Because you are
such a very little boy
with such very big books.
- Don't listen to him!
- It's a trap!
- Son!
- Charles Wallace!
Dad! Daddy!
Dad!
- Dad!
- Hola, amigo.
Check out the view from up here.
MEG: Now what?
What's he doing?
Hmm.
I remember this page.
CALVIN:
He's playing with your mind!
Look!
Teratoma.
Look, Charles Wallace.
A human tumor
with hair and teeth.
Ew. Yuck.
Dad, do something.
Charles Wallace,
don't listen to him!
What else?
- Let him go! Please!
- It's a trap!
Hmm.
Valentina Tereshkova.
She was the first woman
in space.
Leave him alone!
Charles Wallace,
make way for the big show.
The Dark Ages, huh?
Spasiba, Charles Wallace.
MEG: Charles Wallace,
remember what he does.
Now he's trying to get control
of you.
See you sometime, little one.
JACK: Don't listen to him,
Charles Wallace!
Charles Wallace!
Mom should have seen that.
Yes!
Think of Mom, Charles Wallace!
Think of...
- Dr. Murry!
- Dad!
- Dad, are you okay?
- You all right?
Okay, Charles Wallace.
What is it?
I know what you're doing.
And I'm not gonna let you win me
over with a few magic tricks.
Anyways, it's easy.
It's the Fibonacci sequence.
But you're gonna let us leave.
Daddy, me, Meg, and Calvin.
Oh.
Well, of course.
After we've finished the game.
- What game?
- MEG: Charles Wallace, stop!
Our game. The one
that we're playing right now.
- No! Don't!
- Don't listen to him!
- Charles Wallace!
- We're playing a game?
Well, of course.
Didn't you know?
It's a challenge game.
I try to stump you three times.
You get each one, you win.
Is that okay?
MEG:
No!
[Thinking] If I go into your
mind, can I come out of it?
Charles Wallace!
[Thinking]
Yes, but you won't want to.
JACK: Don't listen to him,
Charles Wallace!
Sure.
Fibonacci numbers were first,
and he got that one.
Stop!
Let's see.
What will be next?
Think about us!
Telekinesis?
- No! Don't!
- Don't listen to him!
Charles, think of home.
Think of home, Charles Wallace!
Want to give it a try?
Sure.
Okay.
Well, there's not much
to work with.
But here.
Now, put your hand on mine.
Don't listen to him,
Charles Wallace.
Please.
Don't you touch him!
Ah.
- No.
- Meg!
- No! Not Meg!
- Calvin, help me!
I'm really doing this!
I'm moving her with my mind!
No, Charles Wallace!
Please!
JACK:
They're children!
Don't do this to me.
This is your father!
Listen to me!
Stop now!
MEG:
Make it stop!
I want it to stop!
Dad!
- Dad, help!
- JACK: Meg!
Charles Wallace,
I'll do anything!
Look, guys.
I'm really doing this.
- Please, put me down!
- Meg!
What's the square root of 3?
Think! Think!
The square root of 3, Megs.
Concentrate.
1.7...
I can't.
What does it feel like, Meg,
to be wrong about everything?
Now the square root of 2.
Be quiet!
I've got to get them
out of here.
Help me, Dad!
I can't reach!
The glasses.
With the glasses,
you can work the tesseract.
Oh, but Charles Wallace.
That's not Charles Wallace
anymore.
Meg, join with us.
Be strong for once.
If we don't leave, we'll lose
Meg, and we'll never save him.
Don't do this to me.
Stop her!
- Come on, Meg! Come on!
- Help.
Grab my hand.
- Meg. Come on.
- I can't reach!
Look at me.
- Do it!
- No!
- Get us out of here now!
- No!
No!
Do it.
Charles Wallace!
Charles Wallace, where are you?
Don't let go!
No!
Meg! Meg!
[Grunts]
Meg! Meg!
Meg!
Get out of here!
Leave us alone!
Okay.
I can handle this.
[Purring]
FEMALE VOICE:
No, no, no.
Don't fear, Calvin.
You have landed on lxchel,
a planet for healing
and for understanding.
Hello to you.
There, there.
Dad?
Charles Wallace.
Megs.
Why did you leave him?
Honey, I will get him back.
I will.
I promise.
Why'd you leave us?
Honey, I didn't mean to.
Please.
I never meant for things
to happen the way they did.
I thought once I found you
everything would be
all right again.
But it's worse.
Now, now, my child.
Shh.
You're looking a lot better.
You and Dad never should have
left Camazotz
without Charles Wallace.
We did everything we could.
I never should have left
without him.
I can't be weak now.
There's no time.
Aunt Beast says it's because
of the darkness.
Because it focused on you
and almost took you.
And in the tesseract,
when you were vulnerable.
You need to rest
and be cared for.
And who's gonna care
for Charles Wallace?
AUNT BEAST: Don't let the
darkness cover your heart, Meg.
I feel you're angry
with your father
for abandoning your brother
and you and your whole family.
How did you know?
On lxchel, we feel things not
as they seem, but as they are.
Give me your hand.
Mom?
Hello?
Sandy?
Dennys!
Fort?
Come here, Fort!
MEG:
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Who are you?
What's happening to me?
You're me.
Yeah, unfortunately.
We are so sick of being you.
We really are.
If you don't want to be me,
fine.
Be someone else.
Like I wouldn't give anything
to be someone else.
Someone to believe in.
Someone to love.
That's your problem, you know.
No one loves you.
You're too stupid.
You're too ugly.
You're too weird.
You're too mean.
It's not what they look like.
It's what they are like.
Do you see it now, Meg?
The only way to fight
the darkness
and It and all It's disciples
is when you discover that all
that is important is unseen.
All seen things are temporary.
All unseen things are eternal.
Take time and know, sweet Meg,
that what you seek
is like music.
It sweeps you aloft so you are
moving in glory among the stars.
Take time to find the unseen.
Anybody here?
MRS. WHICH:
I have been fighting this battle
since you humans
climbed down from your trees.
You and your father and your
friend must return to Earth.
Without Charles Wallace?
There are other champions
on this and other worlds.
We will take care
of Charles Wallace.
Well, you haven't done
such a great job so far.
I believe the one thing you
humans may end up teaching me
is patience.
Maybe we have other things
to teach you, too.
Like what?
Well, we don't give up.
And loyalty.
I mean, we stick by our friends.
Oh, I see.
And is it loyalty
that causes you to be so angry
at the Calvin who risked
his life for you?
Is it loyalty that
makes you blame your father
for what has befallen
Charles Wallace?
I don't blame him.
But I know Charles Wallace.
I know how to reach him.
If there had just been time.
I don't think
you know him at all.
Charles Wallace is very rare.
Very special.
One of only a handful like him
in the universe.
The future of all your mankind
is wrapped up in his fate.
His powers are only
beginning to...
What powers?
You've witnessed the earliest
manifestations of them yourself.
You mean that
he's incredibly smart?
And telepathic?
Big deal.
A very big deal indeed.
Such powers in such
unripened form led him to think
that he was ready to face the
darkness, and he was ensnared.
You cannot...
He was ensnared
because he's a 6-year-old
who likes new toys and new games
and thinks he can always win.
And because he likes to learn
new things.
And he's too young to know
that he's not always gonna be
the smartest person around.
Sure, he's some chosen one
to you.
But he's still my kid brother.
Even if he is
a big pain in the butt.
I'm still the one that's got to
look out for him.
And take care of him.
And make sure he stays
out of trouble, like always.
The trouble he is in now is
so enormous you cannot imagine.
Do you know how he thinks?
Do you know whether he eats
the crusts on his sandwiches?
Do you know what his favorite
cartoon character is
or where he hides all my CDs?
Do you know how to sing him
to sleep when he's scared?
Well, do you?
Human passion.
One of the stranger things
I have encountered
in an infinitely strange
universe.
Such weak vessels to contain
such unexpected power.
Really very curious.
Well, we shall see.
Pretty amazing, huh?
Yeah.
But it's not home.
Do you ever think,
what if we never get back?
Yeah.
All the time.
No algebra final.
Is there really nothing
you're afraid of?
Or do you just not want to
admit it?
What do I have to be afraid of?
You didn't really answer
my question.
You were scared
when we first saw those beasts.
Well, of course I was.
I'm not crazy.
There's got to be something
that you're afraid of.
What?
Come on. What?
You want to know
what I'm scared of?
Yeah.
Trying so hard not to be
an O'Keefe loser,
like your brother said, that
I disappear into being good.
Boring.
A big nothing.
You? Boring?
Mr. Perfect?
Yeah.
Perfectly ordinary.
I'm not interesting like you,
Charles Wallace, your parents.
I'm not interesting.
Yes, you are.
And weird.
- Thanks.
- No.
Cool and just different.
So you're afraid
of not being like me?
Yeah.
Well, I don't know.
Who would have thought
that this universe could become
any more mystifying than
it's already turned out to be?
Ooh. Cryptic.
Very Mrs. Who-ish.
What about you?
What are you afraid of?
Right now?
That I'm not gonna be able to do
what I have to.
Meg, we are here.
Finally.
Dr. Murry, we are happy
to finally meet you.
My son, Charles Wallace.
Can you get him back
from Camazotz?
Can you teach me to control
the tesseract?
Dr. Murry,
you cannot even stand.
Not to mention the two broken
ribs you're trying to hide.
Send me back there.
I'll grab Charles Wallace.
This is not your job, Calvin.
Though we honor you
for wanting to take it on.
So if you three can't.
And it's not Calvin's job.
And Daddy's injured.
Then who's going back
for Charles Wallace?
Remember, we want nothing from
you that you do without grace.
Right.
Me.
Megs.
Megs.
All of your weaknesses
are just doorways
to your secret strengths.
You just be Meg
as hard as you can be.
I'd go with you
if they'd let me.
I know.
I'd kiss you,
but your dad's here.
I'm ready.
Meg, I have prided myself
on my wisdom.
But you have taught me much.
"God hath chosen
the weak things of the world
to confound the things
which are mighty."
St. Paul.
"Hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul."
Emily Dickinson.
In all the wonder
of who you are now.
In the glory of everything
you are becoming.
In all that you feel.
You have something
the darkness does not have.
Can never have, my darling.
What?
What is it?
It is only yours
if you find it for yourself.
Meg, you have my love.
Always my love!
What have I got?
What is it that I have?
MAN:
B 11.
WOMAN:
Relax.
It is in control.
It will take care of your needs.
Happiness is yours
if you obey lt.
Surrender to lt.
It was.
It is.
It will be.
Bull's-eye.
I've come back for you,
Charles Wallace.
I knew Mrs. Whatsit
would send you back.
She's a good friend of ours.
I'm not stupid.
Well, we could argue that one.
She hates you.
Hates me?
She doesn't.
And she never could.
HANK:
No?
Well, it's a complicated,
folded,
multidimensional universe
we live in.
Things aren't always
what they look like.
It's not what things look like.
It's what they are like.
Really?
You want one?
Strawberry-banana?
Pineapple-peach?
You hate pineapple.
So sure you know
everything about me?
Yeah, I am.
Mrs. Whatsit.
She's useful.
She's just a mass
of solar energy.
But not indispensable.
Not like Charles Wallace is.
Not like you could be.
No.
You lie.
It doesn't lie!
Unlike Daddy.
Sad about Daddy, isn't it?
He used to seem so strong.
It must be especially hard
for you.
The silly way
you used to idolize him.
That's It talking.
Meg, admit that he's a failure.
I won't listen.
I'm not listening.
1, hydrogen.
2, helium.
Periodic chart.
- Kid stuff, Meg.
- 3, lithium.
4, beryllium.
5, boron.
Daddy abandoned the family.
He couldn't control
the tesseract.
He let us all down.
Especially you.
Daddy made a mistake.
Now he can't help me fight lt.
Your father.
Calvin.
Those witches.
- They have all failed you.
- 7, nitrogen. 8, oxygen.
They always will.
I will not fail you.
With Charles Wallace to help me
and with you to stand
beside him to protect him
and guide him
as you always have.
12, magnesium.
13, aluminum.
Calvin!
Come on.
Pass.
Ah!
The kid needs you, Meg.
Sure, it's a pain, yeah.
But that's our job.
Take care of the little ones.
I still need you, Meg.
I always need you.
Every day.
All right.
Just everyone be quiet.
You're not really here.
I'm sure of it.
- He's not?
- No.
Don't you see, Charles Wallace?
- Yes. Help me. Yes!
- Yes. You understand now.
You're free of lt.
What are you...
No!
No!
Meg, you did it.
You saved me.
We're home.
Mom! Sandy!
Dennys! Fort!
Where have you guys been?
What's going on?
Hi, Sandy.
Hi, Dennys.
How you doing, Meg?
Mom?
Charles Wallace.
Meg. Oh.
I was so worried.
I thought...
No, Mom.
I was worried.
We're okay.
We're fine.
We'll tell you everything.
I'm starving.
We're fine.
And you know what?
We found Dad.
He's all right.
He's gonna be home soon.
As soon as the ladies know
we got home all right.
Oh, Meg.
I'm so proud of you.
So proud.
Meg, you did it.
You found him.
Now everything can go back
just the way that it was.
I guess.
Yeah.
Hey, bro.
Any pineapple?
You got it, Charlie.
Tell us everything.
Where have you been?
A lot happened.
You're not gonna believe me.
- Come on. Tell the truth.
- Yeah. Where have you been?
I've roamed the universe.
A million places.
Right, Meg?
I thought you hated pineapple.
What?
It's a good thing kids grow out
of food fetishes.
Mom, don't you want to hear
about Dad?
Of course I do, dear.
I want to know everything.
It's just I'm so happy
to see you both.
I just want to drink it all in.
No.
No.
I want this to be true.
Let it be true.
- It is true.
- Meg, what's wrong?
What is it, dear?
No.
There's a lie here.
Meg, what...
Well, isn't that odd?
You just had to ruin this
all again, didn't you, Meg?
Just when everything
was going great.
Why can't you be happy
for us, Meg?
And why are you
working against us?
Margaret!
That was cruel, Charles Wallace.
Really?
Well, I guess I'm cruel, then.
I'll never believe that.
Well, I can make never a very
long and miserable time, indeed.
Catch.
These pathways between neurons.
That's "N-E-U-R-O-N-S."
And I'll be taking off points
for misspellings.
Solve the equation,
solve the equation
for how to be someone
that you want to be.
Haven't learned that
in trig yet, have you?
Look, it is pathetic.
Everything you know now.
Everything that you are
capable of.
Stuck here in this wasteland
of stupidity.
And this guy.
This cute little guy has made
your life a misery, hasn't he?
Sorry, Meg.
How often have you hated having
a freak for a little brother?
The one who gets you mocked
and laughed at.
The one who makes it impossible
for you to hide
what you desperately
want to hide.
That you're a freak, too.
You have a place
where you belong.
You don't have to find out
who you are anymore.
Everybody has equality here.
Everybody exactly alike.
Like and equal are not
the same thing.
No.
That's it.
Like and equal are not
the same thing.
And I'll never give in to you.
Never.
Don't listen to her,
Charles Wallace.
She's an outsider.
So what if I'm an outsider?
So what if I thought no one
would ever love me for who I am?
Charles Wallace,
that's not your fault.
Nothing he has said about you
has been the real truth.
And deep inside, you know it.
Charles Wallace, help me.
Why?
You hate me.
I don't hate you.
I never could, no matter what.
You hate me.
I've tried.
I don't know how.
You hate me.
Even as you are now,
I still love you.
Somewhere deep inside,
you've got to know that.
Nothing can stop me
from loving you.
I love you so much.
And I know you so well.
I even love you
for not talking to everyone.
[Moaning]
I love you so much.
I know you so well.
Please, look into my eyes.
You know it.
You know it's true.
No!
Be yourself again.
The Charles Wallace that's so
easy to love, especially for me.
I'll love you always,
even if I never get you back.
No!
It hurts me.
It will hurt much, much more.
Aah!
I know how to take care of you
when you're scared and hurt.
Charles Wallace, I always
want to be there for you.
Charles Wallace!
Charles Wallace, you know me.
Listen to me.
You're my baby brother,
and we need to stick together.
[Grunts]
Meg!
Meg!
Give him back!
No!
Charles Wallace, I love you!
Meg!
[Growling]
I love you.
I love you, too, Meg.
Aah!
What is that?
It's lt, the thing that makes
the darkness.
Some kind of brain thing.
[Wind whistling,
thunder crashing]
[Crowd screaming]
Run!
Wait.
[Ball bouncing]
Come on.
Come on.
You can go now.
You can leave.
You're free now.
It's okay.
Let's get you out of here.
Billy.
It's okay.
People, you can go.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Really.
You don't have to worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you anymore.
Don't you see?
You can't give up.
You can't give in.
Like and equal are not
the same thing.
You have to find your own beat.
Ready?
Wait.
Meg, look.
Star-watching rock.
Home.
You saved me!
Meg, you did it!
We escaped!
- Dad! Dad, you're here!
- Dad!
- Oh, you did it!
- Daddy!
Oh, you did it!
You saved him!
Meg!
Mom!
Mom.
Charles Wallace.
Oh, God.
You scared me.
Jack.
Jack.
Oh, my God.
Jack.
Jack. Oh!
- Dad!
- Dad! Dad!
- Dad!
- Oh, boys!
- Be careful of his leg.
- Dad!
What happened?
Where have you been?
It was Meg.
She saved us.
Meg? No way!
That's impossible.
It doesn't surprise me one bit.
And you, young man,
have become an honorary member
of our family.
Thank you, sir.
Whoa!
- It just gets better and better.
- Yeah.
Mom, you met Mrs. Whatsit.
And this is Mrs. Who.
Whoa!
And Mrs. Which.
This is my mom.
Yes.
Hello.
Just go with it.
I'm sorry we took so long.
We didn't mean to.
Meg, it's all right.
You were only gone
a few minutes.
A few minutes?
We made a little adjustment.
A wrinkle in time.
Well done, Meg.
Well done.
My time as Whatsit is over.
No. Not yet.
I have so loved humans.
But none, my Meg, more than you.
You are a joy.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Calvin.
Wait.
Charles Wallace.
To whom much is given,
much is expected.
What's gonna happen?
Did we defeat the darkness?
That's a job too big
for any one of us.
Even you, Meg.
But we will all carry on
the battle.
You, too.
Even though you've already done
more than your share.
Meg, you are a bright flame now.
A little of me burns in you.
Goodbye.
- What were they?
- Yeah.
- The ladies?
- Uh-huh.
Consciousness, goodness,
energy, light.
Stuff like that.
They helped us fight
this really gross brain
that was trying to take over
the universe.
- Get outta here!
- It's true!
- Yeah, right.
- Sure.
So, where were you?
We went to a few planets.
Uriel, Camazotz, and lxchel.
Eggshells?
That's so gross!
- Lxchel.
- Jack.
Oh, you guys.
What was it?
What?
When you went back
to save Charles Wallace.
How did you do it?
Come on.
What did you have that was so...
Come on, Meg.
You can tell me.
It's bigger than words.
There must be a word
that comes close.
Love.
ME G: And we all lived
pretty happily,
most of the time, ever after.
I realized Charles Wallace
wasn't the only one
that was new.
We all were.
