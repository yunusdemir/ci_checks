--was so ably pointed out
by the secretary general...
...in his opening remarks.
But, and l must emphasize
this point...
...no formula can or will
ever cover each case.
For instance--
When three or more applicants
have been recognized...
...which is in
direct contradiction to--
Whose funeral is it?
Yours.
One more time again?
You're not married
by any chance, are you?
Good morning, 00 7.
Good morning.
lnsomnia, sir?
lnstructions.
You haven't much time.
l'll explain as you pack.
Pack, sir?
Three of our agents were killed
during the last 24 hours:
Dawes in New York,
Hamilton in New Orleans...
...and Baines in the Caribbean.
Baines. l rather liked Baines.
We shared the same boot maker.
Coffee?
Sir?
l take it these killings
are connected.
That's precisely
what you're going to find out.
Baines was working on a small island
in the Caribbean called San Monique.
Dawes was in New York...
...keeping an eye on its
prime minister, one Dr. Kananga.
Hamilton was on loan
to the Americans in New Orleans.
ls that all it does?
By the way, congratulations
seem to be in order.
The ltalians were most impressed by
the way you handled the Rome affair.
Thank you, sir. Sugar?
Thanks.
The authorities
were more than helpful.
There's one small complaint.
They seem to be missing
one of their agents...
...a Miss Caruso.
You wouldn't happen
to know where she is?
Ah, Miss Moneypenny.
Good morning, Moneypenny.
-Good morning, sir.
-Certainly the hour that's indecent.
Really? l've got
your ticket to New York.
Q has repaired your wristwatch.
And some background material
on San Monique.
Thank you, Moneypenny.
l'm sure the overburdened British
taxpayer will be fascinated to know...
...how the Special Ordnance Section
disburses its funds.
ln future, Commander,
allow me to suggest...
...a perfectly adequate watchmaker
just down the street.
Good God.
By pulling out this button, sir...
...it turns the watch into
a hyperintensified magnetic field...
...powerful enough to even deflect
the path of a bullet...
...at long range, or so Q claims.
l feel very tempted
to test that theory right now.
lf you don't mind, Commander,
my spoon.
Oh, sorry, sir.
Thank you.
Dr. Kananga is, at present,
in New York.
The ClA have been informed, and
they're helping with the surveillance.
Your flight arrives at 11:30 a.m.
Now, where did l leave my coat?
Oh, allow me.
Thank you.
Come along, Miss Moneypenny.
-Good morning, Bond.
-Sir. Miss Moneypenny.
Thank you.
Good-bye, James.
Or should l say...
<i>... ''Ciao, bello''?</i>
Such a delicate touch.
Sheer magnetism, darling.
A man comes.
He travels quickly.
He has purpose.
<i>He comes over water.</i>
<i>He travels with others.</i>
He will oppose.
He brings violence and destruction.
Hello. Mr. Leiter for you, sir.
Thank you. Hello, Felix.
How are you?
<i>Traffic permitting, I should be
with you in about half an hour.</i>
<i>Then you can buy me
the best lunch in New York.</i>
Fine, James. Your friend Kananga
has just left the U.N.
He's probably headed back
to his embassy.
No, don't worry. l've got the place
eyeballed, wired for sound, the works.
Right. l'll see you in a half hour.
Easy, Charlie.
Let's get there in one piece.
Charlie?
Right. Stand by.
Here comes Kananga's limousine.
Out he gets...
...with the usual goon squad...
...and the girl.
Time, 11:46.
What is that?
Hello, Felix?
You know how l hate to trouble you...
...but l've run into a little bother.
<i>Your driver is dead.</i>
You what?
Get me a make
on a white pimpmobile.
347 Nelson-David-George.
<i>It would seem, Dr. Kananga,
that the conference has not lived up...</i>
...to your prior expectations.
We can only hope that this
is a temporary setback.
However, l do have
some observations to make.
Take a letter, please.
To Secretary General,
Pan lsland Unity Conference.
Sir...
...l wish to point out...
...that...
<i>...too many
of our island neighbors...</i>
<i>...have once again
let themselves be...</i>
<i>...bullied by United States industry.</i>
<i>The story is an old one...</i>
<i>...the record a clear one.</i>
<i>Since my historic statement
of principles...</i>
<i>...was delivered and acted upon
some six months ago...</i>
<i>...our economic outlook
has improved dramatically.</i>
<i>By exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favoritism towards none...</i>
<i>...new respect for the entire area
has been engendered...</i>
<i>...and even though some
of my most--</i>
James, that car is registered
to a shop at 33 East 65th Street.
That's only a block away from here.
Right.
Take your time, buddy.
Kananga's knitting a flag in there.
<i>It might be
the easiest thing to do--</i>
Something in heads?
Just browsing. Thank you.
Five dollars.
Do you think you could gift-wrap it
for me, please?
Lengthwise, if you don't mind.
Thank you.
<i>Remains my first concern.</i>
<i>Thus, San Monique's future obligations
vis-a-vis her island neighbors...</i>
<i>...would seem clear.</i>
<i>Those who fawn and crawl
in the face of intimidation...</i>
<i>...must perforce to look up
to those who stand proudly...</i>
<i>...wrapped in a justifiable
self-confidence.</i>
<i>The time has come...</i>
<i>...painful as it may be...</i>
<i>...to gaze out among
our sister nations in the area...</i>
<i>...and see if any--</i>
He's tailing.
l got him in my sights.
-Hey, you know where you going, man?
-Uptown, l believe.
Uptown?
You headed into Harlem, man.
Just keep on the tail of that jukebox
and there's an extra 20 in it for you.
Hey, man, for 20 bucks...
...l'll take you
to a klu klux klan cookout.
125th, you got
a honky on your tail.
He's heading east.
Can't miss him.
lt's like following a cue ball.
That's the car.
They must have gone inside.
Pull up where you can.
Sure hope you make friends easy.
Right on, brother!
He's heading on in.
Good afternoon.
Bourbon and water, please.
First booth will do.
-Tell him neat, would you?
-Huh?
-No ice.
-That's extra, man.
l'd like something on the side
as well-- information.
Three men and a girl came in.
Relax, baby.
Mr. Big's gonna take care of you
in a minute.
Black queen on the red king, Miss--
-Solitaire.
-My name's Bond.
James Bond.
l know who you are, what you are
and why you've come.
You have made a mistake.
You will not succeed.
Rather a sweeping statement,
considering we've never met.
The cards have followed you for me.
Now, you get ripped off in Detroit,
baby, you yell out to me, you hear?
ls he armed?
You can't be too careful
in New York City these days.
Funny how the least little thing
amuses him.
Oh, fascinating.
That's you, quite obviously.
An amazing resemblance.
Tell me, am l in there as well?
Pick a card.
Turn it over.
You have found yourself.
l'm telling you, y'all go out there
to L.A. and clean it up...
...or l'm coming out there
and clean you up, and l mean that!
ls this the stupid mother
that tailed you uptown?
There seems to be some mistake.
My name is--
Names is for tombstones, baby.
Y'all take this honky out
and waste him, now.
-''Waste him''? ls that a good thing?
-The reading is over.
Nothing about my future?
Us?
Now, promise you'll stay right there.
l shan't be long.
Thank you.
Keep your hands up, honky.
What does he think this is?
l'll blow his head off, man.
Drop it!
Now.
Harold Strutter, ClA. Where were you
when l didn't need you?
Got obvious
you weren't coming out front...
...not even with that clever disguise
you're wearing.
-Er?
-Whiteface in Harlem.
Good thinking, Bond.
Let's get out of here.
l'm surprised
they didn't spot you too.
There's a most remarkable girl
back there with a deck of cards.
l saw those cards on the way up.
Spades, James, every one.
You were nailed the minute you left
74th. There's only one man...
...who can pull together
that much black muscle in town.
Calls himself Mr. Big.
You name the business,
they say he has a black concession.
What would a foreign prime minister
like Kananga...
...want with an American gangster?
The question is, what would Mr. Big
want with a two-bit island diplomat?
<i>Mr. Big? Where the hell
does he fit into this mess?</i>
A genuine Felix lighter.
llluminating.
<i>Listen, James</i>
<i>we just found out
that Kananga's got a private plane...</i>
<i>...and he's leaving for San Monique
within the hour.</i>
<i>-Then get me on the next flight.
-I already did.</i>
l knew you wouldn't pass a chance to
get away from where the real action is.
The legendary Baron Samedi, folks.
That's Saturday,
for those of you who speak French.
Voodoo God of Cemeteries
and Chief of the Legion of the Dead.
The Man Who Cannot Die.
But for our purposes, just a performer
in a little musical extravaganza...
...we've cooked up
for you wonderful people.
Good evening. The name is Bond.
You have a reservation for me.
Yes, Mr. Bond, of course.
Mrs. Bond has been expecting you.
-Mrs. Bond?
-She arrived earlier this afternoon.
Said she preferred
something a little more private.
Bungalow 12.
An incurable romantic, Mrs. Bond.
Room service, please.
Room service?
This is Mr. Bond, bungalow 12.
l'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please.
Slightly chilled.
Two glasses. Thank you.
Anybody home?
Your champagne, sir.
-What was that?
-Your champagne.
Put it on the table. Thanks.
-Shall l open it?
-What?
No. l can manage. Thank you.
-There you are.
-Thank you.
Mrs. Bond, l presume?
l'm Rosie Carver.
l guess l have
a little explaining to do.
Yes. Either you or...
...dear Uncle Felix.
Custom .38 Smith and Wesson.
Corrugated three-inch stock.
No serial number.
Standard ClA issue.
Question is, why point it at me?
The man who delivered
your champagne is not a hotel waiter.
l was just trying to be careful.
As for Felix Leiter, you're right.
l've worked for ClA
here for some time now.
He cabled me you were coming
and asked if l wouldn't help out.
Perhaps you'd better start
by getting your head together.
-There's a mirror in the bathroom.
-Yes.
You're only my second mission,
you know.
My first was Baines,
the agent who was killed.
lt's a relief to know l'm next in line
for the same kind of aid.
There's a--
A snake. l should have told you.
Never go in there without a mongoose.
l should have never gotten
into any of this!
l'm going to be
completely useless to you.
l'm sure we'll be able
to lick you into shape.
lt's getting late, Mrs. Bond.
Tomorrow is going to be
a very busy day for us.
Kananga is protecting something
down here...
...something which...
...Baines obviously discovered.
You're going to show me the spot
where Baines' body was found.
That, l'm afraid,
only leaves us tonight to...
...well, catch up on old times.
Felix told me there'd be
moments like this.
What did good old Felix suggest?
lf all else failed, cyanide pills.
l settled for two bedrooms.
Good night, Mr. Bond.
Mrs. Bond.
Why, it's just a hat, darling,
belonging to a small-headed man...
...of limited means
who lost a fight with a chicken.
lt's a warning.
Get it out of here!
Please!
Please don't leave me alone tonight.
James, please promise me.
All right, darling, if you insist.
l promise.
l thank you.
Rosie!
Breakfast's up!
-Are you ready yet?
-What?
l have to see
about organizing a car.
l'll see you in the lobby.
Over here, sir.
Guaranteed big fish.
-Catch big fish, sir.
-Hey, baby!
Over here. Bring your man over here.
Just $20. Half a day.
You got warm lady.
We got cold beer over here.
You want to catch a big fish?
lt's only two pounds over here.
Good morning.
Come on, Rosie.
This one seems eager enough.
Excuse me.
Where can l change?
Me. Clothes off. Where?
Stop right there.
Turn around slowly.
Keep your hands up!
As l was saying, Quarrel,
a lousy agent...
...but the compensations
speak for themselves.
Rosie Carver, meet the man
who shares my hairbrush...
...Quarrel, Junior.
l'm really sorry.
l could've shot you.
You might have even killed me
if you'd taken off the safety catch.
Never mind, darling.
You just let us know when we get
to the spot where Baines was killed.
lt's up in the hills
just after we clear the next cove.
Hey, Quarrel,
who the hell lives up there?
That's the house
of the Kananga woman.
She's supposed to have
the power of the Obeah.
No one on the island
dare go up there except him.
He comes again.
<i>There will be violence.</i>
<i>He approaches even now.</i>
-By land or water?
-Water.
He has arrived.
Good. Rosie's been more efficient
than l anticipated.
l know a place
where we can rustle up a car.
Beautiful, brave,
and now resourceful.
Rosie, you seem to be staging
a remarkable comeback.
Tell me about the future.
ls it death?
<i>I said, is it death?</i>
lt is death.
They're coming.
Rosie knows what to do.
Now, l want no bodies
this time, no trace.
lt's down there.
But l thought you said Baines
was killed up in the hills, darling.
Up in the hills down there.
Why don't we have
a bite of lunch and discuss it?
There's an excellent patty
in the hamper.
l'm in no hurry.
Are you?
No.
Oh, you don't know
what finding you has meant to me.
Oh, l can imagine.
And you've no idea
what finding this has meant to me.
You do know what the Queen of Cups
means in an upside-down position?
A deceitful, perverse woman,
a liar, a cheat.
And l'd like some answers now.
Please--
You don't understand, see.
They'll kill me if l do.
And l'll kill you if you don't.
But you couldn't. You wouldn't.
Not after what we've just done.
l certainly wouldn't
have killed you before.
lt used to be a convincing act, Rosie.
lt's wearing a little thin now.
lt's not an act. lt's--
Make your choice.
Rosie.
Rosie!
You will explain what went wrong.
l see the intervention of a woman.
The girl was about to confess.
We had to kill her.
The trap was set.
Tee Hee was waiting.
And you saw death.
lt must have been the girl's death.
lf you do not ask
specific questions...
...l cannot be responsible for
your misinterpretation of the answers.
These growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me, Solitaire...
...even as they did
with your mother before you.
She had the power and lost it,
became useless to me.
You will not make the same mistake.
Where is Bond now?
Where is Bond now?
l cannot see
when you are this way with me.
Things become unclear.
Let us hope these momentary lapses
do not become a habit.
Your power exists to serve me...
...and it is mine to control.
lf and when the time comes
l decide you are to lose it...
...l myself will take it away.
Solitaire, go to sleep.
You have made me angry with you...
...and l have no wish to be.
Tee Hee.
Put down those cards!
lt is a blasphemy!
They tell nothing
to those who cannot see.
But they do.
That's a bit of luck.
Good luck for both of us.
The cards say we will be lovers.
You're mistaken.
lt's impossible, forbidden for me--
Now you must go.
But you do believe...
...l mean, really believe in the cards.
They have never lied to me.
Then they won't now.
Pick one.
You knew the answer
before it was given.
Strangely enough, somehow...
...so did l.
So it's finally happened...
...just as it did to my mother and...
...her mother before her.
Well, of course it did.
Well, you're visual proof of that,
aren't you?
Come on. Cheer up, darling.
Has to be a first time for everyone.
Now, tell me, where's Kananga?
l cannot see.
- Oh, yes, the cards.
l'll get them. - No.
There's no need to be frightened.
You'll soon be rid of him,
l promise.
l promise.
l just need a...
...little bit of information,
that's all.
The power...
l've lost it.
The high priestess is wife to the prince
no longer of this world.
The spiritual bridge
to the secret church.
lt's my fate.
By compelling me to earthly love...
...the cards themselves
have taken away my powers.
Darling, l have
a small confession to make.
Now, try not to be too upset.
The deck was slightly stacked
in my favor.
lt makes no difference.
The physical violation
cannot be undone.
When he finds out
l've lost my power...
...he'll kill me.
Now, come on.
He'll have to find you first.
Lovers' lesson number one--
we have no secrets.
For example, l have a boat waiting.
You can be on it.
All l have to know
before we leave is...
...what goes on
back there in Voodooland.
Darling, three men and a girl have
been killed in the last four days...
...not counting the times they've tried
to stop me from discovering...
...whatever Kananga's protecting.
Now, do you want to be
on that boat or not?
l simply read the cards for him.
l've never been there,
and he's never taken me there.
l've never dared to go...
...but l've looked in the cards.
l've seen great riches there.
They'll kill you.
''Us,'' darling.
They will kill us.
Lovers' lesson number two...
...togetherness till death do us part,
or thereabouts.
ls there time before we leave...
...for lesson number three?
Absolutely.
There's no sense
in going off half-cocked.
-This way.
-How can you be so sure?
These scarecrows are to scare people
away. You're not scared, are you?
Lesson number four--
follow the scarecrows.
-Good morning, boss.
-Good morning.
lt's sure gonna be a beautiful day.
Yes, sir, a beautiful day.
They're heading for the hill.
They're here.
lf he finds it, kill him.
Quick!
We've lost him.
He has the girl.
They're somewhere under the nets.
At any cost, any...
...Bond must die.
Unit two-five, we have picked
them up.
<i>Base to 25. Arrest Bond.</i>
<i>But, I repeat,
the girl is not to be touched.</i>
Message received and understood.
Over and out.
<i>Base to all units.</i>
<i>I repeat, the girl
is not to be touched.</i>
-Go get some more water.
-Get out of the way!
Sweet mother of pearl.
All change.
End of the line.
Get down below quickly.
Here. l'll do that.
You get us started.
<i>It appears a bust.</i>
James.
He'll be looking for me now.
l know he'll never stop.
Come on, darling.
lt's all over.
Voodooland was
just poppy fields...
...a simple matter
of heroin smuggling.
l'll have a word with a man named
Felix and turn the case over to him.
Then you and l will be off. By the way,
where would you like to go?
Anywhere where we can
find one of these.
How quickly can we
make it to New Orleans?
Santa Mina, four hours away.
You can catch a flight and
be there in the morning.
Then get in touch with
Felix on the scrambler.
Tell him to meet me there tomorrow.
Royal Orleans Hotel.
Tampa is closer.
Hamilton was killed in New Orleans,
so there has to be a connection.
And this is a valuable piece
of merchandise we're carrying...
...which, with any luck,
they'll want back.
Royal Orleans Hotel, please.
Are you sure this is
the way to New Orleans?
l don't know, but it sure beats
the hell out of Harlem, don't it?
Well, hello, Jim!
What's happening, baby?
Just ease back now, Jim. Relax!
Mr. Big wants to see you.
You made a mistake back
on that island, Bond.
You took something that
didn't belong to you...
...and you took it from
a friend of Mr. Big's.
That type of mistake is
tough to bounce back from.
-But l've only just arrived.
-Today is your lucky day, Jim.
You're going skydiving.
There's a hell of a view of
the lake from 10,000 feet.
My only regret
is l won't be there to see it.
-Hey, that's him! Let's go!
-Come on, come on!
-Good morning. You're, uh--
-Mrs. Bell. You're not my instructor?
-Where's Mr. Bleeker?
-lndisposed. l'll be giving the lesson.
Come on, come on!
-What's on for today?
-Well, let's just wing it, shall we?
You're over-revving.
Leroy, slow down!
For Pete's sake, slow down!
-Do what the man say!
-l can't find the brake!
Close those doors!
Holy shit!
Look out! Look out!
Okay, Don. Don't worry.
l'll take care of it.
Right. Talk to you later.
l gotta go and give a lesson.
Same time tomorrow, Mrs. Bell?
Yes, Mr. Bleeker.
Yes, sir. Well, l know you just...
...can't glue the wings back on.
Now, Mr. Bleeker, l'm sure...
-...there's no reason for name-calling.
-You can fit the rest this afternoon.
-Right, sir.
-Don't forget the double vents.
l appreciate she may be...
one of your best pupils, yes.
That'll do nicely. That's a little
frantic. l'll keep the other three.
Any suggestion of that kind should
be forwarded in writing to Washington.
-How is Mrs. Bell?
-lntensive care. She'll pull through.
Yes, sir. Oh, no, sir, no one's
questioning your patriotism.
l'm sure you're a veteran, sir.
Felix, you might find out if there's
a Fillet of Soul restaurant in town.
We're way ahead of you. lt's on Docker
Street. Strutter's watching it now.
Hell of a send-off. This way.
-Where's Strutter?
-He's gotta be inside somewhere.
Two, gentlemen?
l got a nice booth over here
just against the wall.
Do you think you could find something
a little closer to the stage?
-What's wrong with a booth?
-l once had a nasty turn in a booth.
-Bourbon. No ice, please.
-Two Sazeracs.
Where's your sense of adventure,
James? This is New Orleans. Relax.
-One of you guys called Felix Leiter?
-Yeah. Right here.
Telephone call for you.
Guy called Strutter.
Thanks. For a minute there, l thought
Harry was laying down on the job.
What happened to my--
-What happened to my friend?
-What happened to your friend?
Thanks for dropping in, baby.
Yeah, you one tough pig
to nail down.
You've been picking at me
like some kind of maggot.
First you go up to Harlem
and kill one of the brothers.
That disturbed me.
Well, then you go and steal
this valuable young lady...
...from my good friend,
Dr. Kananga.
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all
that card crap. l mean, he's mad.
Well, possession being
nine points of the law...
...l would say Kananga is
your problem now. Thank you.
ln fact, if l were you,
l'd watch my step from now on.
Yeah, well, you just let me handle
our business with the man.
l've got my own plans
for you, baby.
But first...
...there's one little question
that he wants answers for.
ln that case, you'd better ship me back
to the island and let him ask in person.
l'm not in the habit of
giving answers to lackeys.
You damn lucky you got a ear
left to hear the question with...
...which is--
Did you mess with that?
That's between Solitaire and myself and
Kananga. l'll tell him when l see him.
You won't see the sunlight
unless you answer me!
l had no idea you were
so frightened of him.
-Did you touch her?
-When l see Kananga.
Right.
Quite revealing.
Kananga, poppy grower in thousands
of acres of well-camouflaged fields...
...protected by the voodoo
threat of Baron Samedi.
And as Mr. Big,
distributor and wholesaler...
...through a chain of
Fillet of Soul restaurants.
Wholesale?
Sell heroin for money?
My apologies. l'm sure
you simply give it away.
Excellent, Mr. Bond.
That's precisely
what l intend to do.
Two tons of it to be exact.
When entering into
a fiercely competitive field...
...one finds it advisable
to give away free samples.
Man or woman, black or white.
l don't discriminate.
Two tons of heroin with a street value
well over a billion dollars...
...nationally distributed free?
That should make a certain group of families...
...rather angry, wouldn't you say?
Angry?
Why, my dear Mr. Bond...
...it'll drive them out of their minds
and, subsequently, out of the business.
Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkie's welfare system.
Well, merely until the number
of addicts in the country...
...has doubled, shall we say?
Then l will begin to market that acreage
that you blundered into the other day.
That heroin will be very expensive...
...leaving myself and the phone company...
...the only two going monopolies
in this nation for years to come.
And here l thought it was Solitaire
did the fortunetelling.
Let's hope for both of
your sakes she still can.
The question still stands, Mr. Bond,
asked by the gentleman concerned.
Did you touch her?
Why, it's not the sort of question
a gentleman answers.
Well, having set the example...
...l don't expect Miss Solitaire
to be any less the lady.
By the way...
...that's a particularly handsome
watch you're wearing, Mr. Bond.
-May l see it, please?
-You'll forgive me if l don't get up.
Butter hook.
Tee Hee...
...on the first wrong answer
from Miss Solitaire...
...you will snip the little finger
of Mr. Bond's right hand.
Starting with
the second wrong answer...
...you'll proceed to
the more vital areas.
Solitaire, my dear...
...l want you to listen
to me very carefully.
On the back of Mr. Bond's watch,
the registration number...
...3-2-6-6.
Do l speak the truth?
You speak the truth.
Well.
lf nothing else, at least
l have laid your fears to rest.
My compliments on
a splendid operation.
There is one thing,
however, the--
Whisper, take him
to the farm.
When do we start back?
Soon, Solitaire, soon.
Solitaire, why?
l treated you well.
You lacked for nothing.
-l don't understand what you--
-Mr. Bond's watch, my dear.
l gave you every break possible.
You had a 50-50 chance.
You weren't even close.
l had no choice.
Please believe me. The cards.
When the time came, l myself
would have given you love.
You knew that. You knew that!
There's only one proper
way to deal with this.
And one proper time.
The tonnage order
is nearly complete.
We move it out tonight.
And l mean tonight.
Mr. Bond.
How much do you know
about crocodiles, Bond?
Oh, l've always tried to keep
them at arm's length, myself.
Cute little nippers,
ain't they?
l don't suppose those potential
overnight bags are orphans?
Oh, no. We have some
moms and dads as well.
ln fact,
quite a few thousand.
This is the part
l like best-- feeding time.
l suspect
the highlight of the tour.
Some of these babies
live to be 200 years old.
Look over there.
That's an alligator. You can
always tell by its round nose.
Aha! There's old Albert.
Now, he's a croc.
Got overcareless with him sometime
back and he took my whole arm off.
-Well done, Albert.
-They'll eat anything, even each other.
Then again, sometime they can go
a whole year without eating.
-Oh, l was rather counting on that.
-There are two ways...
...to disable a crocodile,
you know.
l don't suppose you care to
share that information with me?
One way is to take a pencil and jam it
in the depression hold behind his eyes.
And the other?
Oh, the other is
twice as simple.
You just put your hand
in his mouth...
...and pull his teeth out.
lt's on fire!
Adam, get him!
Adam, get the car! Cut him off!
Hector, move, damn it!
Bond ripped off one of our boats!
He's headed for the lrish Bayou.
<i>The man that gets
him stays alive.</i>
Now, move, you mother--
Toby!
Toby, l got me a regular
Ben Hur down here...
...doing 95 minimum.
<i>-Need any help, J. W. ?
-Hell, no!</i>
You got a set of wheels
that just won't quit, boy...
...if they's yours, that is.
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.
Legs apart.
l'm sure this ain't exactly
your debut with this sort of thing.
You picked the wrong parish
to haul ass through, boy.
Nobody cuts and runs
on Sheriff J.W. Pepper...
...and it's him speaking
now, by the by.
What the fu--
<i>J. W., soon as you nail
that offending vehicle...</i>
<i>...Miss Pearson just called.</i>
<i>Seems her dog's
foaming all at the mouth.</i>
<i>She's got him
locked up in the shed...</i>
<i>...wondering if you'd like to
come over and shoot it for her.</i>
You tell Miss Pearson
take a flying-- Dog.
That look like a boat stuck in
the sheriff's car there, Eddie?
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there's one of them new car-boats.
By the powers invested in me...
...by this parish...
...l hereby do commandeer
this vehicle...
...and all those persons within.
And that means you, smart-ass.
<i>Unit 23 in position.</i>
<i>Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28.</i>
<i>Hey, J. W., seems
like Deke Rogers...</i>
<i>...done got his boat stole
off the river...</i>
<i>...but picked up a new one
in his swimming pool.</i>
<i>Sheriff, you want to get
your boys off our frequency?</i>
Give me that! Now you
listen to me, trooper boy!
We got a swamp full
of black Russians...
...driving boats to beat
the band down here!
<i>Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock
waiting for them at Miller's Bridge.</i>
Unit 26 at Miller's Bridge.
We're just about all set here.
Make that secure there,
you hear?
Okay, fellas, here they come.
All right, out of my way!
l'm in charge here!
You two boys, come on!
<i>I don't want excuses. I want
those two men and their boats...</i>
<i>...apprehended immediately,
did you hear?</i>
Yes, sir, Captain. l understand.
But l don't know right off...
...where we'll find a boat
fast enough to catch them.
l got it. You call
my brother-in-law Billy Bob.
He got the fastest boat
on the whole damn river!
Billy Bob will sure enough fix
their ass, huh? Yeah, call Billy Bob.
<i>Now, there's two boats, Billy Bob,
and they're moving like buttered pigs.</i>
<i>Now, I promised these boys
here you would get them.</i>
<i>-Don't let me down, hear?
-Cool down, J.W. l'm on my way.</i>
-You want something, boy?
-l'd like to borrow this boat, if l may.
Everybody on the river
would like to borrow this boat.
<i>Billy Bob, we got them spotted.</i>
<i>They're headed
for Haley's Landing.</i>
That's my brother-in-law!
That's Billy Bob!
He'll get them.
Billy Bob'll get them.
Hot damn!
lf one side of the Pepper family
don't get them, the other side will.
Let's go!
lf any man can show
just cause...
...why they may not
lawfully be joined together...
...let him now speak, or else
hereafter and forever--
<i>Headquarters to all units,
suspects seen...</i>
<i>...proceeding down via Liberty
towards Highway 11.</i>
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>
Would you get that
chicken coop off the road?
Did you ever think of getting
a driver's license, boy?
Are you sure that was
your brother-in-law, Sheriff?
-Hello, Felix. What are you doing here?
-We'll get to that later.
Kananga's in town. He's got your
girl with him. They just took off.
There's the son of a bitch!
l got him!
What are you?
Some kind of
doomsday machine, boy?
Well, we got a cage strong enough
to hold an animal like you here.
-Would you enlighten the sheriff?
-Yes, sir.
J.W., let me have
a word with you.
J.W., now, this fella's
from London, England.
He's an Englishman working
in cooperation with our boys--
A sort of secret agent.
Secret agent?
On whose side?
We busted the Fillet of Soul
an hour ago.
We came up with nothing but these.
Kananga's clear.
You should have seen...
...the size of the guy
who got on the boat with him.
Nine feet tall, l swear.
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in
one hand and Solitaire in the other.
The incendiary bombs
are set for midnight.
Now, that gives you
exactly 30 minutes.
Watch out for sharks
on the way back.
-l'll see you for breakfast, Felix.
-Good hunting.
You're going to need these and
the shark gun on the way back.
-Seems like the party's started.
-My regards to Baron Samedi...
...right between the eyes.
Trouble!
Ah, Mr. Bond, there you are!
And Miss Solitaire, as well.
Hardly unexpected,
but most welcome.
Whisper!
Two more glasses
for our guests!
-What shall we drink to, Mr. Bond?
-Well, how about an earthquake?
-Welcome home! Where's our boy?
-He'll be along anytime now.
l checked behind a rock,
and his wet suit is gone.
Keep the change.
lt's unfortunate that
your wet suit was discovered...
...only minutes before
the field was destroyed.
-Don't tell me you're not insured.
-No. The poppy's a very sturdy flower.
You have been a relatively
minor nuisance, in fact.
But this gun--
l find it particularly
fascinating. What is it?
A shark gun, naturally,
with compressed gas pellets.
lngenious!
Don't pull the pin out.
The air in here is
foul enough already.
Aw! Somehow l never thought
of you as a poor loser.
l was hoping you would join me
to a drink to the future.
Miss Solitaire used to
know all about the future.
She was especially good
at predicting death.
An underground monorail.
Connected to the last refuge
of a scoundrel, no doubt.
The heroin leaves here, l take it,
carried somewhere by that winch.
Correct again, Mr. Bond.
What a quick study you are.
Let me show you
exactly how it works.
-Where in hell can the man be?
-Relax.
He must have got tied up
somewhere.
These cans hold 25 pounds each.
There are 20 cans to a shipment,
packed in watertight...
...metal containers.
lt's your show, but l'm sure there must
be a simpler way of drowning someone.
Drown, Mr. Bond? l doubt
you'll get the chance to drown.
Perhaps we could try something
in an even simpler vein.
On the contrary, Mr. Bond.
l think you'll find
those wounds quite fatal.
Whisper.
The gate.
Oh, slowly, Whisper!
Slowly, slowly.
Let our diners assemble.
Look out!
-Where's Kananga?
-Well, he always did have...
...an inflated opinion of himself.
Oh, James.
How do we get out of here?
We take the train, of course.
Thanks for everything, Felix.
l'll see you tomorrow night...
Thanks for everything, Felix.
l'll see you tomorrow night...
-...at the 21 Club. Don't be late.
-l don't see why you'll travel this way.
l mean, what the hell can the two
of you do on the train for 16 hours?
Say good-bye
to Felix, darling.
Now, the first thing to learn in
playing gin rummy is to never take...
...a card from the exposed pile
unless you really need it.
Gin.
James, what are you doing?
Just testing an old adage.
Unlucky at cards--
-Do hurry up, James.
-Won't be a moment, darling.
Lock the door as well on
your way up, would you, James?
After all, we wouldn't want anyone
to just walk in on us, would we?
The first time in my life,
l feel like a complete woman.
The slightest touch
of your hand--
l was always so afraid that a part
of me would stay with the past...
...but now l know there's
no chance of that any longer.
Just to be able to
reach out and touch you.
Mr. Bond, it's good
to see you again.
James!
What's going on?
Let me out of here!
James, let me go!
Well, that wasn't very funny.
Now what are you doing?
Just being disarming, darling.
