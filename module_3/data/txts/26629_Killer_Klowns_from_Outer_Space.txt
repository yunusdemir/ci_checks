Little son of a bitch.
Cops.
This is Mooney calling in.
<i>I read you. What's doin' Curt?</i>
Nothing yet, Dave...
...but Friday night's just starting.
I'm heading across down to the park.
Check in with you later.
<i>That was a hot tune from The Doorman... </i>
<i>... but now we'll gonna slow it down a bit... </i>
<i>... for all you makeout artists
at the "top of the world"</i>
Give me a cold one, dude
Fine.
<i>I am Jojo, the ice cream clown,
with the bestest ice cream in town. </i>
<i>We'll give you the stick,</i>
<i>... you give it a lick
and it'll tickle you all the way down. </i>
<i>Ice cream, ice cream. </i>
<i>We brought our goodies here to you,
a tasty treat for while you screw. </i>
<i>Let's take a break!</i>
Cool off those hot lips
with our tasty frozen fruity bars...
...icy wiceys..
Fudgy wudgy bars...
...and everyone's favorite frozen delight:
The lick-a-stick!
- Jeez, what the...?
- Get outta here, you morons!
<i>- Hey! Take your ice cream and get lost!
- Oh yeah?</i>
<i>Quiet down, and turn the speaker off. </i>
<i>Now beat it, you jerk!</i>
So you don't want any ice cream?
Well, you're not gettin' any!
We were getting it
before you showed up.
Those guys...
What the hell are they doing here?
Great idea, Paul.
"Everybody loves ice cream."
What do you mean? It was your idea. Hey.
Why don't we just park here for awhile?
Hey... What are you
guys trying to pull here?
We... we thought we'd park here for a while.
You said we could have
all the ice cream we wanted,
...but didn't say anything about parking.
What kind of girls you think we are?
<i>I told you they weren't that stupid. </i>
<i>- We want you to takes us home right now.
- Yeah. </i>
Take it easy...
Keep your shirt on.
Don't worry, we intend to.
<i>Well, this worked out just great. </i>
<i> Don't blame me.
I didn't wanna come here. </i>
<i> - Hey, why don't we try the drive in?
 - Oh, that's dumb. </i>
<i>Wait a minute. What's playing?</i>
Knuckleheads.
You know those guys?
Those guys are my best friends from school.
Whenever I wanna have a good time,
I call Rich and Paul.
A night out with those guys...
...is a total adventure.
What am I talking about
the Terenzi brothers for,
when I would much rather...
be kissing you?
This is great.
Yeah.
Wow! Check that out!
- Did you see that?
- Yea, I saw that!
That was incredible!
Did you see that little little ole sky
doggie zip down in there, Pooh?
It is Halley's comet
and he's landed in our backyard!
There's gonna be thousands of people!
Thousands of people a comin.
They're gonna have hot dogs.
They're gonna have helicopters and airplanes...
...and tacos.
This is our lucky day!
We's gonna be rich, Pooh.
We gonna be rich.
- Come on, let's go check it out.
- Oh, c'mon. No way.
It's a waste of time.
It's gotta be a thousand miles away.
Ruin our whole evening.
Don't give me that.
You saw how close it was.
It landed right over the hill.
Now that is not a thousand miles way.
Come on.
You can find it, Mr. Adventure.
Debbie, don't you want
to finish our champagnes?
Take it with us.
Come on.
Okay.
Heel.
Come on.
That's a dog. Come on.
Well... I'll be greased and fried...
What in blue blazes is a circus doing up
in these parts?
I love the circus.
Come on. Maybe we can
get us some free passes.
Come on, Pooh.
I have never seen one that
looked like this'un before.
Well... I don't know, Pooh.
You know, there's something
kind of peculiar around here.
Where is everybody?
There ain't nobody around.
Where is the dang ticket booth?
How are we supposed to get in
and see the show?
Pooh?
Pooh Bear?
Where is that dog?
Somethin' funny is happenin' round here.
What in tarnations goin' on here?
Where's my dog?
Where's my Pooh Bear?
I'll tear this thing apart
with my bare hands!
This thing is wired.
Get in there!
What's going on, Curt?
Same old shit.
I caught 'em boozin' it up in the park.
We were just walking through the park on
our way to the dorm. We had a bottle of wine.
Yeah. It's a beautiful night.
We were walking around. We didn't do nothing.
- You guys go to the college, right?
- Yeah, right.
So why don't you just stay there
and do your drinking on the campus?
Why do you have to come into town?
Come on...
We live in this town, too.
I mean, we don't have to just stay on campus.
Yeah...
And it's scum like you
that are killing this town.
Come on, Curt!
Come on. Just take it easy!
What's the matter, Dave?
You got a thing for these little boys?
Empty your pockets!
- We just had a little wine. What's the problem?
- You're the problem, you little shit!
Just lighten up, Mooney.
Just lighten up.
Back off, Dave. Open container,
public intoxication, littering,
disturbing the peace,
resisting arrest...
These kids are history.
Unless you wanna rewrite the laws,
Mr. Police Academy.
Look, you got this problem with my training,
I don't care...
...but if you bring someone into this station,
I don't wanna see you beating 'em up.
Now if you're gonna fuck 'em,
do it according to procedure, or I swear, Curt...
...you and that badge of yours will be history.
Tell you what's gonna be history, Dave...
These kids.
Now get them in there.
- Get in there!
- Shit.
Yeah. It looks like we're gonna have to walk from here.
Let's see.
If instinct serve chief correct...
...path lie...
...that way.
We must travel many moons...
Many...
...many moons. Many...
Enough already with the moons.
Lead the way, Chief Running-At-The-Mouth.
Holy shit!
That's no shooting star. It looks like... uh...
...circus tent.
What's a circus tent doing all the way out here?
Pretty lousy location for a show.
Something's wrong. This doesn't feel right.
Were- weren't we looking for
the shooting star?
Come on, this looks neat.
Let's check this out.
No.
Let's go. I've seen enough.
Oh. Come on, Deb.
I wanna take a closer look.
You can stay here.
Alone?
Well, would you be more scared if
you came with me...
...or if I left you here?
If you left me here. Let's go.
Come on. Come on...
Okay, okay. I'm coming.
Come on, let's check this out.
No, Mike.
We better not.
Deb, You are gonna love this.
Don't be a baby.
This is bizarre.
What kind of circus is this?
<i>It is that new wave European
Circus Fantastique.</i>
Hurry, hurry. Step right up.
<i>See the Circus Bizarro. </i>
Come one, come all.
Step right up, little lady.
Do not be shy. Do not be stupid.
Come see the incredible Miss 50-50...
...Half man, half woman...
The perfect double date.
Yeah. That's my little lady.
Step right up here and see Gumbo,
the toothless elephant.
Or right over here, we've got Belinda,
the bulimic wonder.
Watch here binge and purge
before your very eyes.
Mike, keep it down.
Somebody'll catch us.
God, is this place great or what?
<i>It looks as if it was decorated by
Clowns 'R' Us. </i>
I don't know.
So how much further you wanna go?
Well, let's just go don here to the end
of this hall, where these doors are.
Come on.
Woah!
This is no Fun House...
No Circus either.
What?
I can't believe it.
- What is it, a nuclear power plant?
- No.
- A missile silo?
- No.
- A military base?
- No!
- The shooting star!
- What are you talking about?
The shooting star we went to
go look for, we are in it.
What was that?
I don't know...
...but it's coming this way.
Here. Come on.
Look at this place.
It smells like candy.
You know, I do not know what
we saw out there before, but uh...
this looks like a cotton candy factory, to me.
Yeah!
This must be where they hang it up
to dry before they ship the stuff out.
No, it is not.
I've never seen anything
like this before, have you?
No.
Well that's because nobody has.
I do not believe in UFOs...
...but if they do exist,
then we are trapped in one right now.
Will you just calm down? There's gotta be
a logical explanation for this.
This isn't what you think it is.
Nobody stores cotton candy like this.
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.
Look.
Joe Lombardo!
Down this way!
- Are you OK?
- I... I think so.
Come on.
Popcorn? Why Popcorn?
Because they're clowns, that's why.
Mike, get me of here!
Hurry! They're coming!
We have to tell the police.
Oh yeah, right, we're gonna run to the police station
and tell them there's a bunch of clowns...
...running around in the hills, killing
people with cotton candy?
I have a friend there.
I know he'll believe us.
I do not know, Debbie.
I wouldn't even believe us.
Come brothers.
What the heck?
Dave! Oh my God!
Something horrible's happened!
- Somebody's been killed!
- Wait a second, Debbie. What happened?
You gotta help us! We gotta do
something! There are two people dead!
Who, Debbie, who's dead?
- Joe Lombardo. He's dead.
- And some old man, too.
Wait a second, guys.
Are you sure about this?
Yes, you idiot! They were hanging there wrapped
up in these cotton candy things...
...these... cocoons.
- Cocoons?
- Yes, cocoons.
- You know, cocoons.
- Alright everybody, calm down.
Look Debbie, come inside and explain this to me.
I'd like to help you, but before I can,
I got to understand what's going on here myself.
<i>I really need to get some mascara, though, okay?
Yeah.</i>
<i>- Okay, why don't we just go to the drugstore.
- Good.</i>
Okay? And then we'll go on.
Oh, look.
Cute.
Alright, sit down.
Let's start from the beginning, alright?
<i>Okay. We were up at The Top of the World... </i>
...and we saw this shooting star,
and we decided to go look for it.
But instead of finding the shooting star,
we saw this circus tent.
And that's when we went inside and that is
when we saw those people...
...in those pink
cotton candy cocoons.
Dave, it was not a circus tent.
It was something else.
<i>- What? What?
- It was a spaceship,</i>
...and there was these things,
these- these killer clowns...
<i>... and then they shot popcorn at us.
We barely got away.</i>
Killer clowns from outer space?
Holy shit.
Dave, we are telling you the truth.
You've gotta believe us.
Let me tell you something, honey.
I was just over there.
There's nothing goin' on.
Excuse me please,
but we're talking to Dave.
Now just hold on a second, Mooney. They say
some people are dead. Let's hear them out.
Alright, Dave...
Okay.
Clowns, cotton candy...
...flying popcorn.
Go ahead. Let 'em make fools
out of the police department.
I told you I was
just over there!
Who you gonna believe? Me
or this little this little tramp?
Come on, Mooney!
I'm handling this, alright?
Alright, Debbie, who's your friend?
Mike. We go to school together.
<i>You two were up at
Top of the World together?</i>
Yeah.
I know you, you little fart.
You hang out with the Terenzi brothers.
Clowns? I get it.
Another one of their stupid stunts
...to sell ice cream from that goddamn
truck those hoodlums run around in.
Well, now I really believe this.
You better go now, Dave,
...before the clowns take over, huh?
And when you get back from savin' the world,
...I want a full written report so I can give it
to the chief when he gets back on Monday.
Look, everything happened
just the way we said.
We are telling you the truth!
Alright, alright, uh...
You two come with me.
Come on.
Hurry up, Dave.
Don't let 'em get away...
Go ahead, Dave...
Make a dummy outta yourself!
But you're not gonna make
a dummy out of me.
You, in the back.
Uh... oh!
Uh... excuse me...
Oh, my...
May I help you?
Oh no!
Alright, we're goin' up
there to check this out.
First I'm taking you home, Deb.
No way. I'm going back up there with you.
You can't tell me what to do.
Debbie, just listen to me, would you?
I don't have to listen to you.
You are not my boyfriend any more, alright?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm not your boyfriend anymore.
That doesn't change
the way I feel about you though Debbie.
Dave, please.
Don't do this to me.
Alright Debbie, you got a choice.
Either go home, or I take you back to
the station and lock you up for safe-keeping.
How's that?
Pizza.
Oh...
- Pizza.
- Uh-huh.
Oh?
For me?
Oh Jim,
is this from you?
Look, Debbie...
May I please speak to Mike outside?
Fine... Sure.
Thank you.
- Your old boyfriend? This is great...
- You come here?
He's probably gonna take me on top
of the hill and shoot me.
Look, don't worry about Dave.
It's those clowns
you gotta worry about.
Listen... As soon as you guys leave here,
I'm gonna follow you guys up there.
You're gonna follow us up there?
Debbie, I don't even wanna go up there!
Listen, you stay inside the house
and keep the door locked.
I'll be back here in a little bit
to check up on you.
Okay?
You better.
It's good timing.
Wait a minute.
Where is it?
- Yeah, that's what I'd like to know, pal.
- It was right there, where that hole is.
So you're saying that
hole is where the tent was?
The tent made that hole?
Is that what you're telling me?
Yes! It was there.
Look, we saw it. That's a fact.
I tell you what the facts are, mister!
You said people are being killed.
Now, where are the bodies?
I don't know! I saw Joe Lombardo dead.
I can only tell you what I think I saw.
<i>Oh, so now you just think you saw?</i>
No, I know what I saw! I just can't prove it.
My proof is gone.
Yeah right. Turn around pal.
Mooney was right, uh. Got nothing
better to do but cause problems.
- Well, you're not gonna get away with it this time.
- Get away with what? Debbie saw it too.
Yeah, she did, didn't she?
- Ow!
- Come on.
<i>- Hey Eddie, that a new bike you got?
- What's happenin', Spike?</i>
Wooh!
Big Bad Jojo comin' into town.
- Watch this, babe.
- Is that bike too big for you?
Hey Patty!
- Mean bike you got there.
- Yeah.
Can I take a ride?
Pal?
Uh Uh.
Aww, you can't take a ride...
Can I beep the horn?
Uh Huh.
Oh, thank you!
He shoulda let the man ride his bike.
I'm sorry.
I seem to have broken your bike.
Where did he go?
Badaboo. Badaboo!
What are you gonna do,
knock my block off?
Damn!
Come on, let's get out of here!
- Come on, guys!
- Get out of here!
Here's some ketchup
for your french fries.
Now here's some more ketchup. I want
you to sit still and eat your hamburger.
You know, this isn't as
much fun as it used to be.
It is if you're the winners.
Back here, young lady.
You're not going anywhere
'till you finish your food.
What's going on?
Alright, get out.
Turn around.
What are you doing, man?
You're not gonna hit me, are you?
Just turn around, pal.
Alright.
- Look, I'm sorry about Debbie, but I didn't know...
- Just drop it, Mike!
Check this out.
That's the stuff!
That's the stuff that I was telling you about,
that was wrapped all around Joe Lombardo.
- Where did you get that?
- Over in that jeep over there.
That's McReed's jeep.
- Who's McReed?
- Bob McReed.
He was up here
tonight with me and Debbie.
Those are his glasses.
They got him. He's dead.
Crescent Cove Police Station,
Mooney speaking.
<i>I'd like to report a disturbance. </i>
Wait a minute. Calm down,
I can't understand you.
<i> - Clowns!
- What?</i>
<i>...are at my front door,
and destroying my property!</i>
Clowns, huh, and now
they're at your front door, huh?
<i>Yes, they're at my front door right now!</i>
<i>- Wait. Who is this?
- Could you just getover here?</i>
Stupid kids and their pranks...
Rich little bastards.
I'd shoot 'em all.
Daddy sends 'em to fancy schools...
...so the police department
can babysit the pricks.
Police Station. Mooney speaking. Yup.
Hello, Curt?
I think I have a bit of a problem here.
Just a minute.
Jesus, not you too, Mr. Myers.
Police Station. Mooney here.
What?
<i> - took my wife... The clowns...
- They took your wife away in a balloon?</i>
Well, you don't need the police, pal.
You need a psychiatrist!
Mr. Myers?
The Terenzi brothers
have the whole town are in on this?
Well, to hell with 'em all.
They wanna play games...
...they're messin' with the wrong guy.
Jesus! No!
Oh no! Come on, Joe, get going!
Oh God!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaah!
I'll call the state police up
in Marlborough. They've got a lab.
Maybe somebody up there can
tell us what this stuff is.
It is not cotton candy, that's for sure.
Yes. Finally.
That's what I've been telling you.
Look, I'm sorry I was
a little tough on you back there.
It's been a hard night.
Having Debbie involved
just makes it a lot more difficult.
What can I say? I didn't know...
Its got nothing to do with you,
really. It's me.
Its obvious she goes for laughs,
not stability.
<i> Yoo-hoo. </i>
Ahh! Oh!
Boo!
Oh my God.
That's funny.
Oh! Ah!
Look, you can just drop me off over here,
I'll take the bus home.
No way, remember, you're
the one who's seen these things.
Look! A clown! Right there!
There he is, I told you.
Will you get out there and shoot him?
- Get him, Dave!
- Mike, just hang on.
Calm down. Lemme check this out.
- Holy shit!
- I don't believe it.
- Dave, run him down!
- Mike, let go! Mike!
What are you doing buddy?
You could've gotten both of us killed.
I'm sorry,
I freaked out a little bit.
Where is he?
I don't know.
I don't see him anywhere.
He's gone.
He went straight up.
I've seen enough.
One Baker five.
Curt, do you read me? Over.
One Baker five.
This is Mooney speaking.
I was a little worried about you.
I thought the big bad
clowns got a hold of you. Over.
Mooney, I want you to listen to me
and don't say anything.
I want you to call
the state police and get help.
<i>There are clowns
and they are killing people. Over.</i>
Okay, let me get this straight.
You say there are clowns
and you've seen 'em.
Okay, Dave, that's it. Screw you and
your college flunkies.
I've had enough of this from you,
and from everyone else.
I know what you guys are trying to do:
Break me down, drive me out of the force.
Well, it's gonna take a hell
of a lot more than a lame prank like this...
to get Curtis Mooney to throw in his badge.
So fuck you! Over.
- Aww shit!
- Mooney, this is an emergency. Mooney!
He cut me off.
That son of a bitch cut me off!
I gotta- I gotta get back to the station.
I don't know what I'm gotta say,
but I gotta get through to state police.
- Paul! Get the truck!
- What about the girls?
Forget about the girls.
They eat too much.
- But they didn't pay for the ice cream!
- So what? The truck's getting away!
Hey,those aren't killer clowns,
those are the Terenzi brothers.
The Terenzi brothers?
Get back to the station, radio for help. I'm gonna
catch up with my friends, try to warn people.
Alright, tell everyone to stay indoors
and don't do anything stupid.
You too.
<i>- You idiot!
- Oh, shit.</i>
- Don't yell at me. You were driving.
- Can't you do one thing right, for once??
- This whole ice cream thing was your idea.
- My idea? You're the one who said we could get girls this way.
No I didn't. You did.
- You did.
- You did.
Hey Rich! Paul!
Oh man, am I glad to see you guys.
Mike, how're you doin'?
You want some ice cream? We got-
No, no man, listen. Something horrible's happened.
I need your help.
- What are you talking about?
- What's wrong?
There's no time to explain.
There's clowns goin' around killin' people.
Huh?
<i>Look, tonight, Debbie and I were up
on Top of the World... </i>
...and we found this spaceship
and there were these...
clowns and they were carrying these...
cotton candy cocoons...
and they were shooting these..
these... popcorn guns.
Ther's a circus tent-spaceship, right?
But it's not there any more, but we were
there, we saw the whole thing!
And they say we're crazy.
So?
Oh come on, you guys.
I am not foolin' around!
Mike, what do you want us to do?
We have ice cream to sell tonight.
Paul, this is more important
than selling ice cream.
There's clowns goin' around killing people.
We're all in danger.
Well, we haven't sold that
much ice cream tonight.
- We haven't sold any.
- Come on, guys, will you help me?
Look, at least take me over to Debbie's
house, okay? I think she is in danger.
Does she have any roommates?
Yes, she's got two!
She's got two beautiful roommates!
...with big boobs.
Do they like ice cream?
They love it!
What are we waitin' for?
Come on!
Guys get the...
Get out the away.
Freak you's all!
You ain't gonna get the best of me.
I made it through Korea,
I can make it through this bullshit.
Well...
Woop-dee-goddamn-dee-doo!
What do we have here?
Well son, I think you made a big mistake.
You're in Mooney's territory now.
For me?
I ought to shoot you right now...
You red nosed freak.
So you wanna play games, eh?
Turn around!
Alright...
I am supposed to read you your rights...
...but you're in Mooney's jail...
...and you ain't got no rights.
Alright, buster.
God.
Hey officer Mooney,
c'mon, let us outta here!
- Are we gonna be here all night or what?
- Yeah, we get one phone call, don't we?
- Right. I'm gonna call my...
- Shut up!
Get your hands up.
Get in there.
I don't know who you are...
...but before this night's over...
...you're gonna be begging for mercy.
What are you in for?
Mooney!
Police Department. Hello?
Mooney? Mooney, you back here?
God.
Hey Dave...
Who was the lady
I saw you with last night?
Don't worry, Dave.
All we wanna do is kill you.
<i>V.C.P.D., this is
Marlborough state police. </i>
<i>Dave, Curt, are you there? Over. </i>
Jack, Jack, we need your assistance.
The town's gone crazy.
People are being killed. Over.
<i>What's all these reports
about circus clowns?</i>
These clowns aren't people.
They're some kind of creatures,
things from another planet.
Look Jack, they're killing people.
Officer Mooney is dead.
I know. I saw it. He was killed
by one of these things.
Could you send all
available units immediately please? Over.
Come on, Jack!
<i>Okay, calm down buddy.
Help is on the way. </i>
Debbie.
<i>Calling all clowns,
calling all clowns. This is Jojo. </i>
<i>Are there any space clowns out there?</i>
You Guys. Will you stop foolin' around?
Look, Mike, come on.
Cocoons, popcorn guns,
Monster shadows... Woo-hoo.
- What do you think we are?
- We're not as stupid as we look.
This isn't the first wild thing you've
tried to put over on us.
- Look, you remember Hidden Lake?
- Uh-huh.
Oh c'mon, forget Hidden Lake.
This has nothing to do with Hidden Lake.
We would have to be total morons
to believe this clown invasion crap.
If there are killer clowns
runnin' around here,
...then I'm Porky Pig.
Get the hell outta here!
Ugh!
<i>- Debbie, Debbie, It's Mike. Open up.
- Mike?</i>
Debbie...
Debbie...
Okay, see this
white house right over here?
Take a right... I mean, a left right here.
- Left?
- Right.
- Right.
- No, left! Left!
The house's right up.. uh...
Oh shit. What is that?
Wow... Look at that...
Mike!
Oh!
Come on! We can't lose 'em!
They got Debbie!
Hey, Mike!
C'mon Rich, we're losing 'em.
Can you go a little bit faster?
Come on, Mike, what do you want?
This is an ice cream truck.
Hey Rich, the cops!
Stop the truck!
Woah...
Shit, Rich, now you did it.
I did it?! What do you mean?
You told me to stop.
I didn't, I told you to pull over.
No you didn't.
You said "stop", so I stopped.
Well, I meant "pull over".
If you meant "pull over"
you should've said "pull over".
Why don't you say
what you mean next time?
Come on, let's go see what happened.
Dave, are you OK?
God. Oh fuck...
What the hell are you guys doing?
They got Debbie.
Get in the truck , pal.
Gee, officer, I am really sorry.
I was feelin' a little queasy...
Hey Mike, which
way were they heading?
They went that way, but now we
lost 'em, I don't know where they went.
I do. If you were a clown,
where would you hide?
The amusement park!
- Great!
- Alright!
The park's closed.
I'll have to ask you to leave.
What are you gonna do
with these pies, boys?
Hey!
Heyheyheyhey!
Everybody stick together.
She's gone.
Wow...
Hey you guys, this is weird.
- Look at this stuff.
- Looks like a wad of melted ice cream.
- Yes, well, it's not.
- Oh shit.
Yeah.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Sorry
Mike, you take this. Follow me.
Alright, now, you guys, no fooling around,
stick together, okay?
I don't know what the hell's in here?
Ooooooo-hooooo. Scary.
- Dave, did you get through, for help?
- Yeah, yeah, help is on the way.
You tell 'em it was an invasion?
I told 'em, but I
don't really believe it myself.
Where did they come from?
Why are they here? Why... Why clowns?
They're not clowns.
Some kind of animal, from another
world, that just look like clowns.
Shit, Dave.
Dave, maybe from the ancient astronauts, Y'know
that came to our planet centuries ago...
...and our idea of clowns
just comes from them.
Well, how come they are not funny?
Maybe they're from a dying planet.
Maybe their sun pooped out,
and they need a new place to live.
Maybe they're using us for experiments,
to dissect and study.
So, that means they're intelligent.
So why don't they communicate with us?
I mean, talk to us
instead of killing us?
Maybe they're just cruisin' through
the galaxy and stopped here for a bite to eat.
Yeah. Look, everybody,
let's just hold off from the talking, okay?
Let's not give ourselves away.
What are we gonna do when we find 'em?
Can we kill them?
Yeah.
You shoot 'em in the nose.
Hey, watch this.
Cool.
Weeew!
- What happened?
- What did you do?
I didn't do anything...
Look, don't touch anything, okay?
This place is probably booby-trapped.
Alright. Now look you guys, stay together.
I don't wanna have to run around and find you too.
No problem. We can handle it.
Yeah...
Woah!
Alright, let's go.
Aw, Where'd they go?
Come on, Rich, Paul.
Don't worry about the Terenzi brothers.
They do this all the time.
Those guys are like cats.
They always land on their feet.
Weew...
Are you Debbie's roommates?
Wait a second.
I recognize this place.
This is the tent that
Debbie and I were in. Come on!
Go Mike.
Okay, this is where we were before.
Wow, this is incredible.
Looks like they got the whole town.
We got to find her.
What kind of balloon was she in?
Uh... yellow.
Alright.
- You see anything, Mike?
- No.
Its impossible, Mike.
Shh. Quiet.
Move back.
Ah...
Paul was right, man. They are hungry.
They're gonna eat everybody, man!
Calm down! Just calm down, alright?
We gotta find Debbie,
before it's too late. Alright.
Hey. That's the one.
The yellow balloon. Is she in there?
- Yeah, she's in there!
- Debbie?
- She's alive.
- Thank God.
- How the we get her out of here?
- I don't know.
- Careful, Mike.
- Damnit!
Debbie? Honey?
Hang on a sec, Mike. Damn!
- Woah! What are you doing?
- Just stand back, Mike
- You can't shoot. You could kill her.
- Just back off, alright?
Now, just get ready to run.
Are you alright?
- Are you OK?
- Oh yeah, yeah.
I couldn't breathe.
Let's get her up, Mike, give me a hand.
- Oh God.
- We better get the hell outta here.
Come on, come on.
Oh god...
Wait a second guys. We can't leave.
There might be other people
still alive in these balloons.
Come on, it's too late!
Dave!
Woahwoahwoah.
Graagh!
Shoot 'em!
- This way, come on.
- Coming...
- What now?
- Everybody, down!
- We don't know what's down there.
- Come on, Mike
Nobody's gonna
put me in a balloon again.
Come on, Mike.
Get a move on!
How come you guys stopped here?
- Good reason.
- Okay, which way do we go?
- That doesn't really matter.
- Let's go down here.
Alright, come on.
Woooh!
- Come on, let's try here.
- No!
Fuck...
Come on.
Careful.
Come on.
Shit! Another door!
I can't take this anymore!
Come on, open the door!
- Another door!
- Come on, Mike!
Another door!?
- Another door!?
- Hurry!
Debbie, come on!
Dave, come on!
Go Mike!
- Oh...
- Here! Here!
Come on... Oh God.
We got it.
Look at this place.
Where do we go now?
C'mon c'mon let's go.
Oh...
Everyone, up on top.
Come on, let's move!
Come on!
Hurry!
Eww!
Hey Rich, Paul!
<i>Stop! Leave them alone!</i>
<i>Do as I say OR ELSE! Uh... </i>
<i>Gimme the mic!</i>
<i>I am the great and powerful Jojo!</i>
<i>I command you to stop. </i>
<i>Do not hurt them. Let them go. </i>
<i>You will obey me. Let them go. </i>
That's our chance...
Rich! Paul!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Come on, let's go!
Get in the truck! Let's go!
- Come on, Mike.
- Come on, Debbie.
- Come on, Rich...
- I'm tryin'!
- Turn it the right way.
- I am!
Come on, Rich!
Dave...
What the hell is that?
I don't wanna play here anymore.
Can we go home now?
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
Everyone out of the truck!
Come on!
We can't! It's rented!
Nooo!
Wooaaaaaahhh!
- Rich! Paul!
- Mike, Mike! It's too late buddy.
Look, there's a way out now.
Mike, take Debbie and get her out of here.
- I'll draw it's attention.
- No! Dave, don't! We can all make it!
We can't, Debbie.
- Stop him!
- Dave, let's get out of here!
- What are you doing?
- Now, Mike!
Dave!
Come on, guys, move! Run for help!
Over here!
Come on, you damn clown.
Come on, you!
Aaargh!
Come on!
They're takin' off!
Dave!
You made it!
You got 'em, man.
Wow! What a ride!
Wheew!
That's the last time we let you drive.
You're alive!
Yeah.
But I saw you guys get
blown up in the ice cream truck.
Oh, that. We hid in the freezer
with the ice cream.
- Does anyone want a dipsicle?
- You and your ice cream.
- What?
- How are we gonna pay for the truck?
Don't blame me. It was your idea.
No, it wasn't. Your'e the one who
said we could get girls this way.
You said we could.
Hey listen, if it wasn't for me,
you'd be a dead french fry.
Oh yeah? Well, you'd be a dead popsicle.
Do you think it's over?
Yeah, sure.
