I don't know, feels like a grave.
Their queen is here.
And we have our orders.
It's a trap.
This is what is known.
There has always been man.
And there have always been vampires.
Since the beginning, the two
have been locked in conflict.
The vampire's were quicker, stronger.
But man had the sun.
It was not enough.
And so it went like
this over many years.
The two races destroying
not only each other...
but the world itself.
Facing extinction, mankind
withdrew behind walled cities
under the protection of the Church.
And then the ultimate weapon
was found, the priests.
Warriors with extraordinary powers, trained
by the Church in the art of vampire combat.
They alone turned the tide to man.
The remaining vampires were
placed on reservations.
And fearing the power of
the weapon they created...
the ruling clergy ordered
the priests disbanded.
The former warriors to be integrated back
into a society that no longer needed them.
And as the years passed,
the few surviving priests
faded into obscurity...
like the vampire menace before them.
Residual radiation is still spotty,
but the soil contamination
is close to zero.
With a little luck, we can
finally start planting.
I'm proud of you, Owen.
Great, stew again.
- Atoning for your sins?
- No, why?
Wearing the nicest dress, where else
would you have been all day, but church?
I was in town.
I figure someone here needs
a life outside this outpost.
I thought I said I didn't want you
to spending so much time out there.
- I'm old enough to go where I want.
- You're 18. That's not old enough, not out here.
I know it's hard, but we
all have to make sacrifices.
Sacrifices?!
You mean living out
here like a prisoner?!
- Lucy?
- No friends, no fun?!
Just that someday you might be able to
grow something in these godforsaken lands?
Enough!
Bow your heads and say grace.
Dear Lord, we thank you for
what we are about to receive...
- Daddy?
- Shush!
- Owen?
- Tear down below!
What's going on?!
Hurry child!
Hurry!
- Mama.
- Whatever you hear... don't scream.
Oh, my god!
Get behind me!
Shannon!
God protects you, the
Church protects you.
The city protects you.
Absolution is the only way.
Absolution is the only way.
Remember, to against the
Church, means to go against God.
Confession room 5 is free.
Move forward.
Initiate confessional sequence.
Please speak at the tone.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
- Yes, my son?
- I had the dream again
- about the war.
- Tell me more.
We were in the hives, like always.
Each fell, and I wasn't strong enough.
Tell me more.
I have questions, doubts.
The Devil comes in many shapes.
The best way to combat him, is
through personnel sacrifice...
and a long day's labor.
Yes, Father.
Now say three Hail Mary's
and four Our Father's.
And remember, to go against the
Church, is to go against God.
- Don't point.
- Mom, what's on that man's face?
It's a tattoo.
Did it hurt?
- Why can't I talk to him?
- You don't talk to priests.
- Who are you?
- Name's Hicks, on the Sheriff from Augustine.
- What do you want?
- There was a vamp attack.
They took Lucy. Your brother is hurt
bad. He told me where to find you.
- And Shannon?
- No.
Lucy talked about you. Said
you were a hero during the war.
Said that when it came to killing
vampires, you were the best.
I'm going after her,
I'm gonna get her back.
Just thought I should let you know
in case you wanted to come along.
Figure I could use someone
like you by my side.
Okay.
Thank you for meeting me in
such short notice, Monsignors.
Monsignor Chamberlain has
informed us of the situation.
- Your family is in our prayers.
- Thank you.
I come before you because I
need my authority reinstated.
On what grounds?
- This was a vampire attack.
- Vampires?
Nonsense, we've had no reports of
any escapes from the reservations.
This is obviously the work
of wasteland bandits.
- Monsignor, the boy was clear.
- "The boy" was mistaken.
There is no vampire menace, the wastelands are
heavens for the lawless and the immoral...
To send a priest out there after such a
lot would be both ridiculous and futile.
This is best left to
the local authority.
Monsignor Orelas, this man has been
of great service to the Church.
If it weren't for the priest we
would have been overrun by the...
We are well aware of his
accomplishments, Monsignor Chamberlain.
Thank you, you may sit.
I am begging you.
- Allow me to find her.
- You must understand something priest.
The sanctity of these walls is absolute.
And the citizens from the cities have complete
faith in the Church's ability to keep them safe.
- You will not shake that faith.
- How good is that faith, when it's a lie?
Questioning the authority of the
clergy is absolutely forbidden.
If you take any action
to leave the cities...
it will be seem as an act of
aggression against the Church.
You will be stripped from the
order and excommunicated
immediately. Do I make myself clear?
I said, do I make myself clear, father?
Yes, Monsignor.
Try to remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.
Come on now. Don't be shy.
Give us a kiss.
That's no way to treat a friend.
Please, let me go...
You're in here for your own protection.
If I let you out, you'll be
torn apart, piece by piece.
My uncle's a priest,
he'll come after me.
Really?
- What makes you so sure?
- He'll come after me.
He'll come after you!
Well that's something I'm
absolutely counting on.
The judgment is final. I'm sorry.
I sacrificed everything to serve them.
- And they won't listen to me.
- The war is long over.
You and the other priests did your jobs.
It's not over, not for me.
You can't break your
covenant on a small...
group of savages, it would be sacrilege.
I have to.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Move!
If you go out there right now,
you risk stirring things up again.
You have to look at the bigger
picture, it's for the greater good.
- Is this the world I fought for?
- No.
But it's the only world we have left.
I'm begging you, don't
do anything foolish.
Remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.
Then I go against God.
God help us.
Dear Father, forgive me.
It was never my
intention to offend you.
I would like to firmly resolve
with the help of your grace...
to sin no more, and to avoid
the near occasions of sin.
But I can't.
Looting's not such a good idea mister.
Well, I'll be damned.
Vampires are a vicious lie!
I have seen a vampire
bite a man clean in half.
Salvation is right
here in my very hands.
Authenticated by the
clergy themselves...
- Purchase this holy water and...
- Excuse me in a minute.
Keep your loved ones safe tonight...
I'm tired of you comin' around here,
scaring people, selling your superstition.
The show is over, and
it's time for you to go.
Give me one good reason why I should.
That's one... two...
Alright. Alright, alright!
Goddamn son of a bitch!
You all listen up!
This stuff is good for nothin'...
but lining for that man's pockets
for your hard earned cash!
You don't know that. You're just a kid.
We gotta do somethin' to keep us safe.
Move out of the way!
I don't blame any of
you for being scared,
but the vampires are gone
and they're not coming back.
You have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't to common out here.
Is it true what they say about priests?
You wield the hand of God?
How is he?
He's awake.
Your clergy took away a boy...
and returned an old man.
After the war was over...
Shannon figured you'd come back.
I wanted to.
Didn't seem right any more.
I couldn't save her.
I tried, but I've never had your gift.
You gave her a life I no longer could.
I will always be grateful
to you for that.
You know there ain't one day that went
by, where I wished she'd forget about you.
You find Lucy, you bring her home safe.
And you promise me something brother.
Kill 'em all.
Most people out there know that the clergy
thinks of us as a bunch of godless heathens.
And that's how we like it. It means that they
tend to keep their noses out of our business.
So you can imagine how surprised I was when
they contacted me asking if I'd seen you.
Saying that anyone going after Lucy
is to be arrested immediately.
Said she's in God's hands now.
Problem is, we both now outside
a week Lucy will be dead...
or worse, infected.
So with all due respect to god...
You're wasting your time.
No, no! You're not cutting me out of
this! I'm the one that came and got you!
People in this town don't think
you can keep them safe here.
What makes you think you'll
do any good out there?
- You any good with a gun?
- Better than I am with a knife.
We leave at dawn.
What's with all the bullets anyway? I
thought priests didn't use firearms.
We don't.
They're for you.
You have been called to serve once more.
One of your own has
broken his sacred vow.
His actions are a threat
to the entire order.
You will find him and
bring him back to me.
Dead or alive.
Then I will teach transgressed your
ways and return them back to you.
Save me from blood guilt... and
god who saves me and my tongue...
will sing of your righteousness...
in my mouth declare your prays...
- What is it?
- Vampire tracks are random...
in sets of 2,3 or 4 prints at a
time, but these are two by two.
Must have been some of the familiars.
Vampires don't bring familiars in
the hunt, they slow them down.
All this...
this was something else.
Tracks head north.
- There's a reservation up that way.
- Well, then. That's where we start.
Mangshane Reservation. Nothing
but red-outs and rejects.
They're a fallen tribe.
Either way, we don't have
much time to get in and out.
No guards.
I thought familiars were illegal.
Nobody really enforces it,
as long as it's voluntary.
- Voluntary?
- Yeah, they come from the fringes.
Drifters that want to get infected.
I mean becoming a vampire so
they may live among them.
These people get all sorts of strange ideas.
As long as they keep to themselves...
it makes no difference to me.
You're not welcome here, Priest.
These lands are protected.
No! I got this.
I'm looking for a local girl, kidnapped
about four nights ago by a vamp-pack.
- They came through this way.
- Nobody comes through Nightshade.
It's the way we like it. Nice...
and quiet.
Good, we're sure we
won't have any trouble.
They excrete it, use
it to build the hives.
I guess now we know what
happened to the guards.
No. No, no, you must not...
The Master will be angry...
Where's the girl?
I don't know what you're
talking about. Please! Please!
The Master doesn't feed humans anymore.
Yeah, tell that to the guards.
- Where is she?
- Please don't, don't...
Where is she?
Shit!
Priest! Priest!
Save your bullets.
Now, we can do this the easy way or...
God. I always preferred the hard way.
- Tell me where they took the girl.
- Haven't you done enough already, priest?
- Tell me!
- Look around you. Look what you've done to them.
They once ruled this land, they
were warriors, they were Gods.
- They were murderers.
- They were what nature made them to be.
- Just like you.
- You got 10 seconds to start talking.
Then 10 seconds is all I
need. You're too late, Priest.
It is their time now.
- Did you get your gun on?
- Why?
You're gonna need it.
Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,
- I will fear no evil,
- Your words mean nothing to them, Priest.
For thou art with me.
Focus!
- Should we go after them?
- No need, they'll die at first light.
No more masters, just you and me.
Tell me where they took the girl.
- West. They took her west.
- Why?
You have no idea what's coming, Priest.
The familiar said they
travel west from here.
- Solar mirror.
- A hive?
One of the largest.
But I thought all of the hives
were liquidated after the war.
They were.
That's why we need to go look.
There are more than 50
creeps in this reservation.
But only 6 vampires left. The weak.
They left behind. We find the
missing one, we find Lucy.
I may not have seen the war...
but I know the look a man
gets when he likes killing.
It comes easy to you.
It just comes.
Easy's got nothing to do with it.
Give me your gun.
- What?
- Give me your gun.
Vampires don't move like humans.
Their body weight pulls them
in concentric patterns.
You need to anticipate their
trajectory to get a kill shot.
- Are you teaching me to shoot?
- I'm teaching you how to kill vampires.
There are always two points. A and B.
Know them both, you'll kill a vampire.
A man came aboard. Says
he got something for you.
You told me to come.
I have information, but I...
before I tell you, I
hate to bring this up.
But there is this small little
matter of compensation.
Now, you've been really
good for business.
So I am more than willing
to cut you a deal.
I can smell the blood
running through you veins?
Smells like dinner.
Okay. Alright.
After you snatched the girl, a couple
of nights later, a priest showed up.
- Priest?
- And he was with this Sheriff,
real hard case. He run me out of town
before I could make a single sell.
- You've done well.
- Thank you.
There's your compensation.
Put him to work.
I used to ride out a lot
here when I was little.
Stared at all this stuff.
Wondered what it used to be.
After a while, it just
made my eyes ache.
Did Owen know about you and Lucy?
No, no.
She wanted to tell him, but...
Owen wasn't the easiest man to talk to.
Besides, he was so focused on his work
there wasn't much room for anything else.
Do you love her?
You know if she's infected...
I'll kill her.
You'll try...
but you won't be able to.
I wasn't there to protect her once,
I won't make that same mistake again.
- Feels like a grave.
- It's a trap.
This is a waste of time,
there's nothing here.
Stay here, if anything comes
up that isn't me, shoot it.
Great.
- What are you doing here?
- The Clergy sent me. Ordered me to bring you back.
They sent four of us to track
you. We split up at Nightshade.
I rode out here and hoped
they didn't have you.
The others went up to Jericho.
I didn't believe it when they
told me you broke your vow.
They left me no choice. Hicks!
What the hell is that thing?
- A hive guardian.
- Who the hell are you?!
It's too big to get down here. Which
is the only reason you're still alive.
Who the hell is that?
Are you ready?
Hey!
Not bad.
Point A, meet point fucking B.
The hive's been abandoned for years.
Why would something be protecting it?
Does the lawman know what
you'll do if she's infected?
He knows.
- He'll try to stop you.
- He won't be able to.
It's been hard all these years...
not seeing the others, not talking.
Sector 7 was the only
place I could find work.
Waste management.
No one would hire me.
"No applicable skills."
I heard that, too.
I didn't come here to bring you back.
I came here to warn you.
There are nights when I wake up...
I think I'm back on the red mines.
I'm sweating. My muscles are clenched
like, like I'm ready for something.
Nights like that, I
don't go back to sleep.
I have bad dreams.
Me, too.
There are other nights,
the good nights...
I dream about other things.
- Why doesn't it look like the rest of the hive?
- This sections new. They must have rebuilt it.
My God.
They bread a new army.
Where did they all go?
Only one way to find out.
Are priests allowed to have relations?
- We take a vow of celibacy.
- So, you mean you've never...
I was a young girl when
the Clergy found me.
What about him?
His talents developed later.
He was nearly you're age when
the Clergy came for him.
That made his sacrifice
greater than most.
The air is changing.
Well, there's your answer.
They dug right through
the mountain and...
made a hole big enough
to fit an army through.
What town is that?
It's Jericho.
Where'd you say the others went?
What the hell?
Hello?!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
Let's begin.
I don't see anything.
Brothers, you have a choice.
You can follow in my footsteps
or you can follow in his.
We're too late.
We separate. Go through each
building, and see what we find.
There's nobody left. Not a soul.
Too many mouths to feed.
Killing three priests? What kind of
vampire could do something like that?
Nothing we've ever seen before.
How could they take an entire town
over night, and vanish by sunrise?
There are no other hives
around here, no reservations.
- Where does this rail line go?
- It's an old mining line.
It starts in the Dunkirk
mine above Augustine.
- Jericho's the last stop before it reaches...
- The cities.
Heading back to the cities
would be suicide, right?
- The sun will kill them.
- There is no sun in the cities.
Not anymore.
Without us, they're defenseless.
- I'm responsible.
- No, this was systematic.
Whoever took Lucy knew
that you'd come for her...
and that we'd come for you.
They were drawing us out.
They must have been picking
up different factions
along the way, moving during
the day and feeding at night.
- It's going to be a massacre.
- It's going to be a war.
Train carrying an army of vampires?
What chance do we have
stopping something like that?
I'll overtake the train and blow the
rail-line. You two get aboard and find Lucy.
I'll start charging the bikes.
It's gonna take everything we have
to stop that train before
it reaches the cities.
You must be starving. You
haven't eaten in days.
Have you ever had a real roast duck?
It's very rare, very exotic.
- Of course not.
- Try it, you'll never have better.
- What do you want?
- I want the same things that you want.
I want to be free from a life
of suffering and sacrifice.
To no longer be told that
your every desire is a sin.
And after all, if you're not committing
sin, you're no longer having fun.
What are you?
The Church teaches us that the
eyes are the window to the soul...
and since the vampire evolved without
eyes, it is a soulless creature...
to be eradicated.
And I have seen the soul of the
vampire. And let me tell you...
it is far more pure
than that of any man.
Now you ask me what I am?
I am the bringer of the tide...
I am the wave to wash
clean this unclean world.
And you and your priest...
will help me do it.
He's gonna kill her, isn't
he? If she's infected?
She talked about him. Said
she never got to known him.
She wanted to.
What kind of man would kill
his own flesh and blood?
If she becomes a familiar,
she's no ones flesh and blood.
Not anymore.
I've held on to it all these years...
to remind me of everything
they've stripped away from us.
Our honor, our abilities, our faith...
Today when we ride, I
want you to remember
our power doesn't come
from the Church...
it comes from God.
With or without the Clergy,
we're still priests.
I can't.
When I heard what happened to Shannon...
I prayed for her salvation.
And then I prayed for mine.
Because in the darkness of my heart...
I hoped her death
would free you at last.
- Tell me you won't kill her.
- Hicks, don't do this.
Tell me, or I will shoot
you where you stand.
It would be easier to face you bullet
here than face what may lie up ahead.
Why do you even care? She is
nothing but a stranger to you.
She's his daughter.
- She was just a baby when the Clergy took me.
- You're lying. I knew Owen.
The child needed a father.
We all made sacrifices.
Hicks.
If you do this, it won't
matter if you find Lucy.
It won't stop the train, and
you won't be able to save her.
You won't save her.
We ride out and meet this together.
When the time comes, you blow the
tracks and then you get out of there!
What if you're still on the train?
Good-luck.
Focus!
Holy shit.
Hello, my friend.
- You fell!
- You let go!
In the depths of that hive, I crossed
the threshold between life and death.
And do you know what I found?
The queen we had come to
kill, my angel of mercy.
She turned me into something that
had never existed in this world.
A human vampire.
Join me. Accept the blood of the queen.
And together we can
return to the cities...
as brothers.
- Where's my daughter?
- Waiting for your decision.
You can't win. I'm stronger
now than you ever were.
This is your last chance, Priest.
The queens hands have not been idle.
Mankind will find no
quarter from what's coming.
Join me, and your life of
sacrifice will be over.
Never.
Hicks!
Lucy!
- Fuck.
- Did you find her?
I couldn't get close. They
took her to the front.
- You would have made a good priest.
- Thanks.
Don't let it go to your head.
- Hicks!
- Lucy!
No!
Stop it!
No, Lucy!
Very good! Fast.
Just like your father.
He never told you?
Oh, god!
Burn.
At this time of need, strengthen me.
You are my refuge and strength...
I do not fear, for you are with me.
I won't let you go!
Your faith has failed you!
No!
For the life of the
flesh is in the blood.
And I have given it to
you upon the altar...
to make atonement for your souls.
How dare you come back
to this holy place?
A man who would defy the Church,
for his own selfish crusade!
Look inside the burning train
just behind these cities walls...
you'll find hundreds more like it.
- And their queen was not among them.
- Lies!
This man is a charlatan. A risk
to the security of the cities.
There is no vampire menace!
- The war is over, Priest!
- No.
It's just beginning.
I've notified the others. We'll meet
you at the rendezvous at City 7.
Godspeed!
