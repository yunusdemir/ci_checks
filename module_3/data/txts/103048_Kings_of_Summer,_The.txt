Hey.
So, are you guys around tonight?
Because you should totally come
to Thirsty Thursdays.

- I'll... I'll be there.
- Cool.
So it's at Wolf's Pond,

Oh... my God.

I can lend you a shirt.
I've got like five

Oh... Grandma,

Hi, Mrs. Keenan.
Darling, would you
like a cold washcloth?
What? No. No washcloth.
How about you, Joseph?
Actually, yeah, I would...
I'd love a washcloth.
No, Mom, sit. What the hell?

My mom reminds me of Blanka.
That's the sound I hear

I have a party tonight,

Sorry.
Too bad.
The plans are already made.
Your sister's driving

I'm making lamb stew.
Are we in Beowulf?
Look, after dinner,
I was thinking
we might bring back Game Night.
It'll be fun.
Game... Game Night's
a family thing, Dad.
I'm not going to play Game Night
with some spider woman
you found in the gutter.
Carol is not a spider woman
that I found in the gutter, Joe.
She's a very nice lady
who happens to like me.
And I like her.
So, we haven't played Game Night
since Mom died, and then,
all of a sudden, you meet
some floozy and expect...
Enough! Enough, Joe.
This is not a debate.
My house, my rules.
Now, go get ready.
WOMAN: So, Joe,
your dad told me
that you go
to Tottenville.
Are you on any teams?
Carol, before we go any further,
you should know--
Frank is not my real father.
I love him,
and I owe him a lot.
You know,
he's very special to me,
but he's not my blood.
Is that true, Frank?
That's completely untrue.
I'm taking Ventnor.
Frank, the lamb
was delicious.
Just so tender and...
it was like I was
chewing avocado meat.
I'm not sure I know

Yeah, I do-- mostly
'cause I'm not a man.
Nor am I Chinese, so...
Oh, my God, what a panic.
That's something

He's a racist.

Hope so.
A bear would feed us

Dude,

Guys, stop yelling!
This isn't helping anything!
- He's getting worse. -Oh, my
God, he's really letting it go.
- You're pissing yourself, kid.
- KELLY: Guys, he is burning up.
We need to get him
out of here.
You up for a little walk, buddy?
All right, look,
you two, run up ahead,
pull the car up
as close as you can
to the mouth of the woods.
- You know how to put it
in gear? -Fuck, yeah.
Watch your mouth. Good, good.
Let's go! Let's go! Move!
Come here.

JOE:
So...
you honestly believe
that you saw Heaven?
Yes.
There were many demons.
(JOE CLEARS THROAT)
But I'm better now.
Stronger.
If I had to do it over,
I'd get bitten again.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I know you would, Biaggio.
You're a good friend.
Remember when I said,
"If I had to do it over,
I'd get bitten again"?
You... you just said that.
I was wrong.
I would never do that again.
KELLY:
Joe.
I...
I, um, got this for you
from the gift shop.
Uh, it has an eagle on it,
the snake's natural enemy.
"You're miles above the rest."
(CHUCKLES)
I-I guess they didn't
have one that said, uh,
"You saved me
from an agonizing death
by rapid blood oxygenation."
Uh, they did; just no envelopes.
Look, Joe, just...
just because we're not dating
doesn't mean that I don't
care about you at all.
We didn't even know
if you were dead or not.
You know?
I would give you a hug
or something, but I don't know,
maybe you don't want
to be anywhere near me.
No.
A hug can work.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
VICKI:
Hey.
Is he okay?
Uh, yeah.
Biaggio is in there.
(QUIETLY):
Okay.
Okay.
See you, bro.
FRANK (VOICE-OVER):
So, who's this Kelly?
Is that Patrick's girlfriend?
Yep.
Looking that way.
She looks like
a real heartbreaker.
(CHUCKLES)
Yes.
You were very good, Joe.
In the woods, before.
Good?
Yeah.
You were very good.
I was really proud of you.
(CHUCKLES)
Thanks.
Guess I'm a man now, huh?
(LAUGHS)
You're getting there, bud.
No need to rush.
WOMAN (OVER P.A.):
Stroke alert.
Fifth floor, building B.
Room 514.
Stroke alert.
So, uh...
how are things
between you and Carol?
Carol?
You're referring
to the spider woman
I found in the gutter?
That you found
in the gutter, yes.
- That's the one.
- The same. One and the same.
Things, uh...
things are actually
cooled down between
Carol and me.
It's baffling.
Just... I can't quite
pinpoint the exact moment
when everything went south.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
- Yeah.
- It's a puzzle.
Sorry about that one.
It's okay.
It wouldn't have worked anyway.
She didn't...
(SIGHS)
(VOICE-OVER):
I don't know, she...
she didn't make me nervous.
Not like your mom did, anyway.
And you need that.

FRANK:
Mm-hmm.

Patrick's just being an idiot.
