Ghost Two, this is Echo One.
Ghost Two, this is Echo One.
E.T.A.: four minutes.
Repeat: four minutes.
- [Both Grunting]
- [Man Shouting In Foreign Language]
[Continues In Foreign Language]
Intel confirmed.
Nine hostiles, three marines.
Ghost Two, you are not to engage.
Alpha Team is on its way. No time.
[Shouting In Foreign Language]
- You guys ready to go home?
- Yeah.
- How do we get around them?
- We don't.
We go through them.
[Soldiers Shouting In Distance]
Atten-hut! Look sharp, marine.
As you were, gentlemen.
- Triton.
- Sir?
Outside. Ten minutes.
Yes, sir.
We have approached this thing from every angle.
The judge advocate's done hearing your case.
- What about an appeal?
- They're not accepting more appeals.
Bottom line is, you disobeyed a direct order.
You're being discharged.
You served your unit, your corps
and your country with honor, son.
Walk away with dignity.
Colonel...
I am a marine.
One of the best. Remember that.
On behalf of a grateful nation
and the United States Marine Corps...
I thank you for your loyal service.
- Thank you.
- Oh!
You're home.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I just...
I can't believe you're here.
You know, the hardest thing
about you leaving was not knowing.
You know, not knowing where you were
not knowing if you're coming home...
not knowing if I am going to get
that phone call saying that you wouldn't be.
You married a marine, Kate.
I know it's not going to be
easy for you, John.
We will figure it out together.
I am home now,
and I am not going anywhere.
Good. And speaking of that are you
sure about starting this job tomorrow?
Oh! I just think there's so many
other things you could be doing.
If I sat around here all day, I'd go insane.
I just want you to be happy, John.
I am happy. Come on.
- Oh! Geez. Where are we going?
- To make me happy.
- I will be right back.
- You got it, man.
What?
You got it, man.
You know, Scarface. Come on.
Do it again.
Okay. You got it, man.
Wow. That's horrible.
[No Audible Dialogue]
- How you doing?
- Fine, sir.
Excuse me.
Everybody down.
Everybody on the ground, now!
Ladies and gentlemen,
keep your heads down and your mouths shut.
I don't want to see any eye contact.
I have severe intimacy issues and a gun
so do yourselves a favor and don't look up.
What I want is on
the other side of this door...
but that's going to be a little tricky
because... it's bulletproof.
So here's how we're going to do it.
Hi, honey. Can I borrow you for a second?
How you doing in there, sport? Oh, God!
Please! Oh, don't look at him. He can't help you.
Please! I have children!
I don't think he cares.
Please!
Fill it.
Get down!
Thank you.
Rome.
You got to hit me.
It's got to look real... For the cops.
That's real.
Well, the cops are coming. I'd love to
stay and chat, but, uh,
I can't. I apologize for that little
outburst of anger I showed earlier.
That's really more for dramatic purposes
than anything else.
I hope that what I have done here today
doesn't force you to have...
a negative opinion of me or how you think
I feel about the great state of South Carolina.
Because I love it here. I do.
I love the people.
Enjoy the rest of your day.
What? Too much?
Ooh...
Okay.
We know how they got in here.
Once they're in, they don't bother
with any small stuff.
They just go right for the vault
with 12 million in diamonds in it.
The same diamonds
that were delivered just 24 hours ago.
What are the odds of that?
And how did our guys know...
that they were going to get
so lucky today?
We could ask our friend
on the floor over there.
I will bet he knows.
[Chattering]
I don't care.
No, do you understand
what I am saying? Oh, really?
See if you can understand this.
Is this what you do all day?
Hmm?
I had a Game Boy but they took it.
Come on, man. This is a great job.
Good benefits. Great money.
A couple two, three years,
they move you to management.
How long you been working here?
Nine years.
How come you're not in management?
Security.
We will be right there.
Psycho ex-boyfriend on 12.
Rick, have you lost your mind?
This is my job.
Oh, really? It doesn't
look like a whorehouse.
Where's all the other whores?
Where's your pimp?
You were with him. That's the reason why you
didn't answer your cellphone all weekend!
Sir, could you please come with us?
Don't mess with me, pork chop.
You're causing a scene. "Pork chop"?
You think this is a scene? Wait till I tell
Daddy about the little whore he raised! Sir.
- I am just going to have to ask you to come...
- Ask me to what?
Take a seat, flattop. I will get to you
in a second. Oh, really? Now, listen to me...
Hey. Get your hands off me!
Why are you so angry?
You got the Drake.
Dude, let me call you back later.
Because I am trapped in an elevator
with a couple of jackasses, that's why!
We kindly ask you
to leave the premises, sir.
Thanks.
Seriously, just spit-balling here.
You know, tell me if I am close.
Right out of high school,
straight into the military?
Realized you'd never be all you thought you could
be and that's how you ended up as a rent-a-cop.
Tell me I am wrong.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The genie just tried to hit me, man! I know.
I saw that, and he shouldn't have done that.
You shouldn't have done that.
But he missed, and you're fine.
We deal with people like this every day,
and in order to avoid an incident...
sometimes you just got to let things go.
Yeah? Well, you better
tell your boyfriend to back off.
Unfortunately for the genie,
this is not one of those times.
Oh....
It's on now.
See, you really messed up.
Somewhere, somehow,
somebody just got all this on video.
By the time you go to sleep tonight,
I am going to own this building.
And tomorrow...
...don't be late.
Because when you clock in, you're fired!
Johnny.
A toast.
To your first and last day on the job.
Yeah.
- About that...
- Dude, I told you, don't worry about it.
It's not the first time
I have been suspended.
That's not it. Um... John, you will find
another job. You got all that training.
Training.
Covert reconnaissance.
Close-quarter hand-to-hand combat.
Demolition.
Not a high call in the workplace
for skills like that, Joe.
Okay, but you're a smart guy.
You can do whatever you want.
You don't get it. It's not...
It's not about work.
It's not about a job.
Being a marine meant everything to me.
Now I go and get fired
from some bullshit security job.
Sorry.
I don't know what to do.
Look.
I am not going to try and pretend
I know what you're going through...
...because I don't.
And... And your time as a marine.
Yeah, it's over.
And that sucks, man.
But your life's not over.
I mean, it's changing
but you got to learn to change with it.
Sometimes... Sometimes, it's good to just
take a step back and see what you still have.
You know, I think I am going to
go home and see my wife.
Yeah. She's hot.
What happened today?
We made a lot of money.
In the vault... with the kid.
That kid showed that
he couldn't keep his mouth shut.
And Morgan blowing up that cop car?
He went a little overboard.
But in all fairness to Morgan...
I was firing an automatic weapon at those cops.
Dead cops, all those witnesses....
Doesn't that pose
a potential problem for us?
So does a prison term.
Bottom line is, we got away clean.
What's the matter, Angela?
Don't you trust me anymore?
Look at me.
That kid knew my name.
That's dangerous for all of us.
Baby, is there anything in these eyes that
makes you think I could ever hurt you?
What? Let's forget about what you
did to our guy in the vault.
You killed two cops today,
and that's a problem.
Don't start with me. You arrogant bastard.
You have lost control.
That's where you're wrong, my friend.
You see...
...I have gained control.
Is that right? You bet your ass that's right.
What's the matter with you, Rome?
Have you lost your mind?
Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?
I know exactly who I am talking to.
You see, I have the diamonds.
Therefore, I have the power.
You have no idea of the level of hell
I could bring down on you.
Yeah, but you won't,
not if you want to see these diamonds.
Tomorrow, noon. I get my diamonds,
you get your money.
Listen. About what happened at work today...
I am not telling anybody.
Cool.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
- How was work?
- Fine. Yeah? What? What happened?
- Talk to me.
- Nothing.
Stuff.
They're hired to protect us.
But who will protect us from them?
Security guards out of control tonight at 11:00.
Stuff. Like you throwing a guy out of a window?
Yeah.
I thought my days of worrying
about you were over.
What happened?
This isn't me. Well, you jumped
into work the minute you got back.
Kate, what was I supposed to do?
Come home, sit around?
- That's not me. I can't do that.
- I know you can't.
- What if we just took off?
- What?
Yeah, just... left. Gone.
Do something crazy. We will get up
in the morning and we will go somewhere.
- Where? I don't know where.
- Anywhere. It doesn't matter.
That's not the point. I just...
I have been thinking a lot about it.
- You have?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- What do you think? Just me and you.
I really want to do this. Come on.
Say yes.
Say yes.
- John, say yes! Come on!
- Okay, okay! Yes, yes.
Hey, man! You're Lincoln Kennedy!
Hey, man, what are you doing here?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.
Oh, come on, 72. I know it's you.
Husky Hall of Fame,
three consecutive Pro Bowls.
Man, you even started in a Super Bowl.
You didn't win, but you started.
Come on, man.
I know it's you.
Morgan...
Thanks, L.K.
Let's take a walk.
- Rock candy?
- Oh, man, you know I hate rock candy.
Oh, that's right,
because of that one time.
- Ooh.
- Yeah.
Let's walk it off, big guy.
How'd you like that Benz
I hooked you up with? Liked it?
Shit! 24-valve V-8.
Fourmatic all-wheel drive.
What's not to like?
If you like that, you're going to love this.
- What's it going to be, a Mustang?
- Nah.
- A Jag? Better. Come on, man.
- Tell me, what is it? Right there.
Man, that's a minivan.
Rome said inconspicuous.
Yeah. But how are you going to send
a brother out in a minivan?
- Man, I am a criminal, not a soccer mom!
- Come on, big guy.
CD, DVD.
If you want, I will even have
Johnny throw some spinners on it.
- Fuck you!
- Or not.
Maybe I am not making myself clear.
You see, I am a black man.
- Yeah, I got that.
- Okay. Okay, and that is a minivan.
Right.
Black men don't drive minivans, Frank.
They do now.
Morgan, the five of you
are never going to fit in one of those.
Take the van. Nobody pays attention.
You guys can just disappear.
What do you say?
Keys are in it. Knock yourself out.
# Sunshine #
# I can call you my baby boy #
# You can call me your baby girl #
# Maybe we can spend some time #
# I can be your sunshine #
Mount Cedar. I used to go to camp there.
God, I haven't thought
about that in a long time.
But the mountains are hours away.
Are you sure you don't want to
just stop at the beach?
- I think I have seen enough sand.
- Okay.
Besides, you're not the only one with
childhood memories of the mountains.
You never told me
that you went to Mount Cedar.
It wasn't Mount Cedar. Further up.
So are you going to tell me where?
It was just a place that my daddy
used to take us when we were kids.
What'd you guys do up there?
Was it fun?
It was all right.
- Dad liked it.
- Why?
I guess it's because he knew
it was far enough away...
...where nobody could hear
me and my brother scream.
We got to get some gas.
- Ahem. You want anything?
- Uh, a Diet Coke. Okay.
- Nice butt.
- What?
Oh, man.
How you doing?
Cadillac man, huh?
Yeah.
- What happens there stays there.
- What?
The Vegas sticker.
Oh, yeah. It's my brother's car.
- He lives in Vegas.
- You visit him much?
Couple times a year.
Me too. My mom lives there.
I just love it there, you know?
Especially downtown.
You ever go to the Olympus?
Oh, not since they tore it down last year.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Don't move.
Great.
Take the truck!
- Come here! Bring her!
- Where you going? Come here!
- Damn!
- John! Stay down!
- Shut up!
- John....
- Get off of me! John!
- Where the hell did she come from?
- Do we kill her?
- No. We might need a hostage. John....
- Get off me!
- John!
Morgan, get in the truck!
Come out here.
OK. Come on. Hang in there.
Okay, keep pressure on that.
I am going to call for help.
Highway Patrol, this is John Triton.
You have officers down at Manze's Gas.
Multiple assailants.
Four men, one woman headed
southbound on I-95 in a black Navigator.
They have a hostage. It's my wife.
"Kate Triton." Married to John Triton.
Sergeant John Triton.
She married a marine.
What'd you marry him for? Benefits?
Hey...
- Settle down!
- Get off me! Settle down!
You got to be kidding me.
The cops.
That ain't the cops.
I hate cops.
And rock candy.
- Shoot him.
- No!
Will somebody please shoot this guy!
- What does it look like we're doing?
- Missing.
Hey, slow down!
Slow down!
Look out....
Hey!
Whoa!
No, no, no, no!
Hey!
This guy's like the Terminator.
You murdering sons of bitches!
Somebody shut her up
and get her out of here.
You murderers!
Now, Angie, baby, I know you got a hair
trigger but I said shut her up, not kill her.
We might need an insurance policy.
Get a rope and tie her up.
Put your hands together.
Front axle's history.
We're not going anywhere in this thing.
Oh. Now, you figured that out all
by yourself, huh? Actually, I did. Yeah.
But, hey, you know what else I figured out?
What's that?
That you're a trigger-happy nut job
who belongs in a cage.
All right!
We are monumentally screwed here...
and the last thing I need is you two
bickering like a couple of little girls.
So as of right now, it's over.
Are we clear?
Because if we're not, I give you my word,
I will absolutely shoot you myself.
- What do we do now?
- The way I see it, we got two options.
"A," we stand here
and try to kill each other...
and then no one gets paid
and someone gets dead...
or "B," we get out of the swamp,
make our drop and collect our dough.
And maybe it's just the greed talking,
but I am sticking with "B."
Yeah, well, I say we move, because
every cop in the state heard that blast.
We will follow the swamp downstream.
- Through there?
- Yeah, through there.
The trees will give us cover from the air.
The swamp will slow down the cops.
What do you want to do with our little
insurance policy? Oh, go to hell.
Angie, why'd you do that?
Now Morgan's got to carry her.
Morgan's got...
Morgan's got to do what?
Watch out for crocodiles.
What's the matter with you?
Ain't no crocodiles in South Carolina.
- Detective Van Buren.
- Sir.
- What do we got?
- Well, we got one deceased officer here...
and another found seriously wounded there.
The guy who called in?
John Triton. He's an ex-marine,
and he's for real.
His description of the perps sounds like the crew
that hit the diamond store in town yesterday.
- Are the roadblocks up?
- Yes, sir.
Choppers and search teams
are on their way.
So what else do we know about these guys?
They're sloppy.
Unit four, come in.
Go ahead.
We got a report of a multiple car accident.
And shots fired five miles
south of your position.
That Highway Patrol car from your location
was involved. Check and advise.
I am en route.
Detective Van Buren, Homicide.
I am going to assume you're John Triton.
They took my wife. That's a matter
for law enforcement now. Listen,
I have seen them kill three people.
My wife will not be number four.
- I can't give you permission to pursue.
- I am not asking for it.
You know, this whole area's tidal.
The way the water level changes, these guys
are going to be impossible to track.
- I can handle it.
- Triton?
I have seen what these guys can do.
You better hurry.
Get the chains out. I want
this river dragged. Are we in the air yet?
If you and I are going to be friends,
you need to learn some manners.
Bitch.
Man, the hell with this.
What, do you got a problem, brother?
My problem is walking through this dirty-ass
swamp with the entire county looking for us...
because somebody decided
that killing cops was a good idea.
Genius, that somebody's you.
- You're the one that killed the cops.
- Yeah. Both of them.
Oh, so now we want to start
playing the blame game, huh?
Always want to blame the black man.
Somebody steals a car, the black man did it.
House gets robbed, black man.
Cop car gets blown up by an Israeli
single-shot shoulder-fired rocket launcher.
- Guess who.
- The black man.
That's right, Vescera. The black man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Morgan.
You are one crazy son of a bitch.
I like that. I do.
But no one's going to get killed here until
I give the go-ahead and I didn't give it.
- What was that?
- The go-ahead.
Why Vescera? You never know when
you will need a crazy son of a bitch.
- I thought you said there were no crocodiles.
- Those are alligators.
Do you think they're hungry?
Not anymore.
- What do you got?
- Nothing yet.
There's no way anybody
could have lived through this.
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.
Yeah?
Where are you?
How you doing?
How am I doing?
Not so good, huh? Well, you know that
triple homicide I was just involved in?
- The one all over the news?
- Yeah, right. That's the one. Yeah, I know.
Bad. Anyways, I think I can now add
kidnapping to my litany of atrocities.
As a matter of fact, I know I can, because she's
standing there right in front of me right now.
- Why are you telling me all this?
- Why am I telling you all this?
Well, because in the middle of blowing up the
gas station killing the marine and now kidnapping,
I had a great idea. As a matter of fact, it's such
a great idea that I even came up with a name for it.
It's called "you're out."
Which basically means you get nothing.
No split, no diamonds,
no payoff, no nothing.
- We had a plan, Rome.
- I know we had a plan, but plans change.
At least, for one of us they do.
Now listen, if you think for one second...
There's no way you can get away with
this without me. Can you hold on? Yeah.
- Yeah?
- This is he.
I am just calling to let you know
that your order has been approved.
Yeah? Now, does that include all the premium
channels and the sports package? It sure does.
All right, the air show's over.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Go on.
That's a creepy-ass snake.
Slimy and scaly.
It's terrifying, all these animals and bugs.
I hate this, man.
I am not built for this stuff.
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me? Think about it.
How many brothers you see in Deliverance?
The answer is "zero."
Do you know why?
Because brothers don't camp.
Why does everything always
have to be racial with you, Morgan?
Why do you feel the need
to confine us to these labels?
Why can't we just be people?
What do you think, Kate?
I think you're psychotic.
Ho, ho. Now, how can you say that?
You don't even know me.
That's very judgmental.
Is she looking at me?
I am going to be totally honest here.
I, uh....
I thought that you and I, you know.
We could have had a future, you know,
if it wasn't for....
Mmm.
What?
- Mmm.
- You're insane.
Maybe.
Good talk.
- Cops.
- Get the truck loaded.
Hold it right there, cop.
I am not a cop.
I am just looking for some people.
Boy, I will end you.
I told you, I am not a cop.
Wait here. And somebody shut her up.
- What do you got?
- Nothing. All right.
- Van Buren here.
- Sir, come in.
What's going on at the south fork? There's
nothing here. We're headed for the marina.
I want every shack
on that riverbank searched.
- Find them.
- Copy that.
What did you find?
There's a lodge up there.
It's swarming with cops.
What do you want to do now?
We will let the cops leave,
and then we will cross the river.
- [Man, Indistinct] Take these.
- Get them loaded. We got to move.
What the hell you doing out here, cop?
You guys got it all wrong.
Save your lies, boy.
If I was a cop,
I'd have a badge. A gun.
I don't. I am just out here trying to...
Just trying to what?
They got choppers buzzing around here.
And I got you sneaking up our asses.
And you're not a cop?
Right.
You're right.
I am a cop.
They're tracking my G.P.S. right now.
G.P.S.? I told you to search him.
- I did!
- Find it!
Where's the goddamn bug, cop?
What you doing, man?
No contact point. No alarm.
It's a freaking shack.
Get in there.
Something die in here?
I don't know, but it smells like baked ass.
Morgan, see if you can
go find a generator.
- Why me?
- Why not?
What if there's some guy out there
with a hockey mask and a hatchet?
Or a group of country-ass crackers
craving some man love?
It will be fun, like summer camp.
Yeah, but brothers don't camp.
Yeah. Well, actually, I did go to camp once.
I was 13 years old.
And there was this camp counselor.
Cool honky.
Timothy.
Tim.
Or, as he liked to be called,
Johnny Whiplash.
Well, tell us, Morgan, what did this, uh...
Johnny Whiplash have to offer?
Well, at first, he offered friendship.
Then some rock candy.
Then he offered me something
that I never should have accepted.
Wow.
Well, good luck with all that.
Now go find the generator.
Hey.
What we talked about...
- Ain't leaving this room, right?
- No. No.
Now go find the goddamn generator.
Cool.
- Hello.
- Yeah, hey. It's me.
- Hold on. Frank.
- What?
It's Rome.
- So how's my Cadillac?
- Plan A's screwed.
- No shit. You're all over the news.
- We're switching to plan "B."
- Well, what the hell is plan "B"?
- I don't know what plan "B" is.
- I am making this up as I go.
- Great.
You know that joint, Rita's,
down by the marina? Yeah.
I want you to leave a car there for me. I am
going to need some time. Give me till tomorrow.
No. As soon as you can.
Looks like we're going to Phoenix.
What are you looking at?
Why so sad?
Don't like your new friends?
- You're pathetic.
- How so?
You're like his little puppet.
So what's the plan?
Where are we going?
What, no faith?
I have faith. I just need to know
if I am still in the loop.
There's this guy in Phoenix.
I figure since we did 100% of the work...
...why not keep 100% of the diamonds?
Can he move them?
That he can, my friend.
That he can.
- You grew up on the water, right? Louisiana?
- Miami. Yeah, whatever.
See if you can go get
that boat started out there.
Hey, uh, Bennett.
Check out Morgan.
See what he's up to.
Morgan.
How many are left?
There's two upstairs.
- You wait here.
- I am not waiting anywhere.
You don't know what you're walking into.
Listen. It's only a matter of time before
they realize these two aren't coming back.
I got to do something,
and I got to do it now.
Okay.
Playtime's over.
There's a crazy son of a bitch.
Where is she?
Oh, this just gets better and better.
Put it down.
All right.
Easy, big guy.
He's still got something I need.
Listen, I don't care what you do with him.
I just want my wife.
Oh, he's not going to do anything to me.
Not until he finds out what happened
to those stolen diamonds.
Because that's what he's after.
His cut.
Isn't that right, Officer?
Now, why don't you just take a second
and let that sink in there, champ?
- Where are they, Rome? Where's what?
- Give me my damn diamonds!
Whoa! Calm down, V.B.
I know our last deal didn't work out too
well but I am willing to make a new one.
You see, I tried to kill this guy twice today.
And he just won't die.
Maybe I am having an off day.
I don't know.
But if you shoot him right now...
I am willing to split the diamonds with you.
What do you say?
- There's our ride. Let's go.
- Go where? What happened?
A marine showed up, that's what.
John! He's still alive?
Let's go!
Oh, no. You're not putting me in there.
You're not putting me in there.
Out of the water!
Get out of the water now!
Turn around.
Put your hands above your head.
Turn around.
I am John Triton.
Shut up! Down on your knees.
Place your hands behind your head.
- I am the guy that called you.
- They have my wife. Shut up, boy!
You're under arrest. You have the right
to remain silent. I suggest you use it.
You're dead, boy!
Son of a bitch!
Look at that.
You don't mind if I keep this one, do you?
I am sure we can work something out.
Work something out?
Whoa. Wait a minute, baby. Work something out?
I got to drive. Baby, I can't do this.
Say yes.
Baby, I got to drive.
Oh, yes. Yes.
What's the matter, baby?
Don't you trust me anymore?
Unit 4, this is Command. Over.
We got to get rid of this car.
Any suggestions?
Van Buren.
Yeah....
I got one.
# Should have been gone #
# By now #
# By now #
# Don't know why #
# I am sticking around #
# All you do #
# Is run me down #
# Should have been gone, gone, gone by now #
- Hi.
- Hey, girl.
- Nice truck.
- Want to go for a ride?
Base to River Unit. We have a positive
identification on your trucker.
Last logged in driving a gray semi.
A vehicle matching that description was just
seen five miles north of Rita's Marina,
heading southbound on Route 16.
So what's the plan? We will pick up our
clean car, and then we're home free.
Get that bitch off me.
I don't see the car.
Let's check the other lot.
What the hell was that?
John!
John....
John!
John......
John!
Got to go, babe.
John......
Say hello to your wife!
Come on. Come on.
No, Kate. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Wake up....
Come on!
Come on.
Come on, wake up!
Wake up!
That's it. Come on. That's it.
We should have gone to the beach.

# Uh, this is how it go down #
# I have the black pound silence
so it don't make sound #
# I pile 150 out of town,
ain't nobody around #
# I am in the back seat breaking it down #
# My love has been a bad streak, dog,
lately I have found #
# Hard press made us turn the radio down #
# But God bless,
now they talking about laying me down #
# Now they on about shovels
and the weight of the ground #
# What now #
# Preaching on the way that they handle thing #
# Waiting patiently
to do the six-foot sand thing now #
# So I take a second look at my life #
# I made too many mistakes
that I just couldn't make right #
# Should have been more focused
than I take things light #
# When I am gone
this is what you all will say I was like #
# An arrogant fool,
no, not the baddest or cool #
# Just a big fish caught up
in the shallowish pool #
# Not a big name player, in fact it's true #
# Never would have been
without the cats he knew #
# He got lucky,
rode the coat-tails of everyone's fame #
# In two weeks ain't nobody
going to remember his name #
# I am ready to go, I done made records #
# Made monetary off of the flow #
# More importantly, though,
I proved everyone wrong #
# It's all over regardless of what you say
when I am gone, what now #
# What would you do if it all ended tomorrow #

ain't no more you can borrow #

# What would you do? What would you do #
# I want you all to feel the realness,
the truth in my words #
# I have been quiet for too long,
the truth should be heard #
# It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn #
# Cat showed up on my lawn
in a rugged uniform #
# Unexpected, there's a knock on my door #
# I met this fool in the club #
# I don't see him before #
# Open to greet him,
but the second he sees me #
# His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy #
# But it's cool,
I didn't even catch it at first #
# I check his shoulder,
homie's rocking a purse #
# Now I know something's tricky,
but I am already sitting down #
# Homie pipes up,
you should hear what he's spitting out #
# Says I have been sleeping with his wifey #
# And he ain't the type of cat
to take that lightly #
# I made a move and he told me,
"Homie, wait" #
# Reached in his purse, pulled a chrome .38 #
# He asked me if I am ready to die #
# Said he was going to blow my brains
all over the sky #
# Said he was leaving the country
and he's straight with the passports #
# Cocked the hammer,
I am thinking my last thoughts #
# I am in a bad way, nothing could save this #
# I close my eyes hoping it's painless #
# Just waiting for the sound,
ready to swallow too #
# But homie having trouble
with his follow-through #
# By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground #
# Homie's confused,
he just want to be talked down #
# His wife is sleeping through town
and he knew it #
# Picked me out of a crowd but couldn't do it #
# He squashed it, and as he's walking away #
# I realise life is short
so I am marking the day #
# Now it's full speed ahead,
I will rest when I am dead #
# And I could give a...
what the next man said #
# I live how I want to live,
buy what I want to buy #
# Do what I want to do,
try what I want to try #
# Fear nothing, take chances #
# Not afraid to fail,
always making advances #
# So when I ride on the grim reaper highway #
# No regrets, I did it my way #
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #
