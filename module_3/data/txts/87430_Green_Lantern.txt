<i>Billions of years ago,...</i>
<i>...a race of immortals harnessed
the most powerful force in existence...</i>
<i>...the Emerald Energy of "will power".</i>
<i>These immortals,
the guardians of the universe,...</i>
<i>...built a world from where they could
watch over all of existence...</i>
<i>...the planet, Oa.</i>
<i>They divided the universe
into 3600 sectors.</i>
<i>A ring, powered by the energy of will,...</i>
<i>...was sent to every sector
to select a recruit.</i>
<i>In order to be chosen by the ring,
it was said one must be without fear.</i>
<i>Together, these 3600 recruits formed the
"Intergalactic Peace Keepers"...</i>
<i>...known as the "Green Lantern Corp".</i>
GREEN LANTERN
Subtitle by Darkopal
<i>Of all the threats
the corp ever faced,...</i>
<i>...the gravest was an entity of fear
known as "Parallax".</i>
<i>Only the legendary Green Lantern "Abin Sur" was
capable of capturing and imprisoning this beast.</i>
<i>Which he did
on the lost planet of Ryage.</i>
<i>PLANET Ryage: LOST SECTOR</i>
Explorer 6 to base, our ship has crashed
somewhere in the northeast of the Lost Sector.
Please send help immediately.
You are afraid. Good.
<i>Six months later
SECTOR 2814</i>
Sinestro, I'm traveling at maximum velocity.
Tell Fentara...
Fentara is dead.
And the planet's inhabitants?
Permission to evacuate them
is no longer necessary.
It's just as it was on Talok.
Every life form destroyed
and their essence absorbed.
Traces of yellow power everywhere.
- And the Guardians?
- The Guardians are silent.
I've demanded an audience.
<i>Abin Sur...</i>
<i>I'm badly wounded.</i>
<i>Heading to the nearest inhabited planet,
for the selection process.</i>
<i>Tell the Guardians that
it was "Parallax".</i>
Oh, no! No!
Sorry, but I've gotta run.
Make yourself at home, okay?
There's water in the tap.
Asshole!
The "Ferris Saber 3" is state of the art
with artificial intelligence fighter flights.
It has all of the flying and combat
capability of a human pilot,...
...but with none of the human error
they comes with it.
Carl does not just tell stories
to get the contract, gentlemen.
Your staff, these contractors, my office...
...we have all part of this
from round up.
Well, I appreciate that, Senator.
Today, the rubber meets the road.
We have a simulated
combat situation.
Two Sabres against
Carl's two best pilots.
Hey, Carol!
It's gonna be a little dull fly day,
what do you think?
I think you are late!
Yes, but that's only because
I slept in.
Well, I used to sleep in,
but then I turned 11.
Let me give you a little heads up...
I've gone up against
these Sabers all week...
...and they have smoked me
every time.
There is nothing that you can do,
that they can do better...
faster and without
disappointing women everywhere.
I think we both know that is not true.
That is the exact reason I did
not want you for this...
...my father did, I would have
chosen Jenson.
I would have chosen Jenson, too.
Unfortunately, he is busy...
...not being good enough.
At least he shows up.
Hal, this test today
it's important.
I got it. I'm going to make you
look good out there, don't worry.
Okay, now... let's get these pants off
and fly some planes.
- Highball, weapons check now.
- Roger, that.
- Good morning, Mr. Ferris.
- Good morning.
Gentlemen.
- Are we almost ready, Tom?
- Yes, Mr. Ferris.
We are go for test.
Sapphire, you're authorized
to go "weapons hot".
Ferris Test, Sapphire...
Weapons are hot.
Hide and seek, Highball?
Ahhh... Yeap.
God damn it! Tom, what the hell
are you feeding those things?
F-35s, what else?
Wakey-wakey, Sapphire.
If you got a clean shot,
now it's a great time to take it!
Easy, Highball. Just lining it up.
There is no way we're
taking these out solo, Sapphire.
Get over here and let's figure
something out.
On my way, Highball.
Now stay right there
and look real pretty.
Highball, did you just use
your wingman as a decoy?
Highball, those Sabers on your tail,
can fly anywhere you can.
Then lets go somewhere,
where I can't fly.
What the hell is he up to?
Cover corner.
Highball, rules of engagement set
the ceiling at 50,000 feet.
Yeah, that's because the Sabers will stall
if they go any higher, right, Tom?
And so will you.
<i>Compressor stall.
Compressor stall.</i>
Yes!
I mean... damn it, Hal!
Your boy certainly
takes his job seriously.
<i>Ailerons, Hal, side to side.</i>
I got it.
<i>Hal!</i>
Keep it warm for me.
Going to 25,000 feet.
- Are you okay there, Highball?
- Yes, just taking my victory lap.
- Going to 20,000
- Highball, give me some roll!
Yes, Dad!
<i>Hal, do you read me?</i>
<i>Highball, you're approaching minimum
ejection altitude.</i>
<i>Highball, you're below 10,000 AGL,
spins are unrecoverable!</i>
<i>Eject! Eject! Eject!</i>
- You're not scared, are you dad?
- Lets just say, it's my job not to be.
Dad!
Dad!
- You stupid, son-of-a-bitch!
- Calm down, Bob. It doesn't matter now.
It does matter. Never mind that
you crashed a brand new F-35...
...you broke the rules of engagement,
you sacrificed your wingman...
...and you blew the contract that this company
and half the state were depending on.
I am sorry!
I thought that this was a dog fight.
I was under the impression,
that the objective was to win.
The objective was to show what the Sabers
could do in actual combat.
And in combat, no pilot is going
to sacrifice his own plane.
I did.
Now you know, you gotta boost
the ceiling on your robots.
I also showed you what they can't do.
You didn't have to make that point in front
of the commander of air force aquisitions.
Enough, Carol.
Since I'm going to have to lay off most
of my company, anyway you're fired.
- It's too late, Carl, I quit.
- You don't get off that easily.
He's not fired and you don't quit.
You're grounded...
...pending the results of
an investigation.
Watch your back.
That's impossible, Bob.
- You wanna tell me what happened up there?
- The controls locked up.
Don't give me that, Hal. You had a window,
and you could have recovered.
Did you chock? You wouldn't be the first
pilot it happened to, but I need to know...
My controls locked up.
What the hell is all this anyway, huh?
What's with the ridiculous suit?
I know your dad's been bugging you
to take over the company...
- But this is taking things a little far,...
- Listen, my career choices are not...
- ...don't you think?
- ...on the table right now.
You're a pilot, Carol
and a good one.
Giving up flying to take
a goddamn desk is bull shit.
Hal, I like the business part
and I'm good at it.
Which by the way it doesn't mean
I'll never get on cockpit again.
It isn't one way or the other.
That's the way a child looks at things,
and we aren't children anymore.
At least...
I just don't want to see someone
I care about getting hurt.
Least of all, you.
Choose well.
<i>A test pilot's daring manouvers,
almost ended in tragedy.</i>
<i>Witnesses say pilot Hal Jordan, ejected
at the last possible second,...</i>
<i>...before his plane crashed
in the open desert.</i>
<i>He is the son of the late Martin Jordan,...</i>
<i>...who was killed in his own ill fated
test flight, back in 1993.</i>
<i>Now we are told that Hal Jordan
is doing fine right now,...</i>
<i>...though we have yet to hear
an official statement from Ferris Air.</i>
Hey, guys.
Hey, how was work?
It was amazing, Jack! Thanks for asking.
Hi, Janice! How's teaching going?
Hey, just help me out here because
I'm really trying to understand this.
Do you want to be like him so bad
you need to die like him too?
- I see, you just assume that it was my fault.
- I talked to Carl, Hal!
He said that you forced the plane
so far past the limits...
That's my job.
It was an accident,
everybody walked away.
Like your motorcycle accident, that put you
in the hospital for a month?
You know I miss all this
quality family time.
Good talk, Jack!
- God!
- Jack, come on!
You okay?
- Where's Jason?
- In his room.
Why?
Hey, it's uncle Hal.
What's up there, Ace?
This is the worst 11th
birthday party I've ever been to.
No dancing girls?
- I'm fine.
- I guess I got a little freaked out or something.
- It happens.
- Not to you.
Look... I told you that you
don't have anything to worry about.
Do you want to know why?
I may be a total screw up,
in every other part of my life...
...but the one thing that I do
know how to do is fly.
Hey! I got you something birthday boy.
I wrapped it myself.
- Cool. It's an X-1, right?
- It's a Starfighter.
My dad gave me that.
Lets put it up.
What happened today,
I mean, when you crashed?
Not really sure, exactly.
Were you scared?
My job not to be.
You know, you're totally missing your
super lame birthday party.
Beat it... Go, go, go, go, go!
I'm glad you're okay.
Me too, Ace.
Stay with me. Stay with me.
I'm gonna get you some help.
You'll be okay.
Everything will be okay.
- Your name... Your name?
- Hal. Hal Jordan.
Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur,
protector of Sector 2814...
Listen, we are going to get you
to a hospital, okay?
That has purple blood.
The ring, it chose you.
Take it!
Place the ring in the lantern.
Place the ring... speak the oath.
- A great honor... responsibility...
- I don't understand... you have to breath.
All you gonna do is breathe.
Just, just breathe, okay?
No, No! Hey! No!
Hey, come on, man. Don't do that.
Don't... Don't do that.
Aww... Come on!
Come again?
- Is that a spaceship?
- Yeah.
Is it real?
It's real.
Okay. Let's see what kind
of power source...
- We can learn from...
- We can't stay here!
- What?
- We gotta go.
A pilot, he wore a uniform.
I think he was a soldier.
- He gave me this.
- He proposed?
We're gone! We're gone, now!
They're going to know someone was out there.
Alien pilots don't just bury themselves.
I couldn't just leave him there.
I hope this thing isn't radio active.
Well, you're the genius...
Wow! Jesus!
I got it.
He said that the ring chose me.
He said it was a great honor
and a great responsibility.
Responsibility? You?
Maybe on their planet,
responsibility just means asshole.
Let's hope so.
A great light as gone out
in the universe.
Abin Sur is dead.
Four of my lantern brothers killed.
The inhabitants of two worlds
annihilated by an unknown enemy.
An enemy that possesses
the yellow power of fear.
We know it originated from somewhere
within the lost sector.
We know it grows more powerful
with each encounter.
According to Abin Sur's last transmission,
he seemed to know what it was.
His only words were:
"It's Parallax."
We are aware of the threat.
We are assessing the situation.
While you assess,
innocent lives will be lost.
Let me take the fight
to this new enemy.
There is much of which you are
not aware, Sinestro.
If the danger is as great
as we suspect...
What are you saying?
You believe this enemy
can defeat us?
Guardians, if your faith in our power
is faulted,...
...let me renew it.
Let me take a squadron of my strongest
lanterns against this enemy...
...and I will prove to you that our
best days are not behind us.
<i>"BUSINESS - Rising Star

Dr. Hammond?
Dr. Hector Hammond?
We need to ask you to come with us.
Did Adam put you up to this?
Get out of the car please.
Dr. Hammond? Dr. Amanda Waller.
I must apologize for the theatrics,
but the goverment does like it's protocols.
Please, follow me.
Is that what I think it is?
An alien life form, doctor.
The first that mankind
has ever encountered,...
...despite what the conspiracy
theorists would have you believe.
We want you to do the initial assessment
of his physiology.
My God!
Why me?
As a xenobiologist, your skills are
specifically suited to the task.
Beyond that, I am not at liberty
to tell you.
Hello!
The eyes, nose, ears and mouth
are humanoid.
And the left anterior thoracic region,
has a 10 centimeter wound,...
...with jagged edges containing
"attached cyanotic colored cohesion".
Okay, alright. Place the ring
and speak the oath.
The oath...
Is everybody knows the oath?
Used to say it at camp.
I, Hal Jordan,...
...do solemnly sware,
to pledge allegiance...
...to a lantern that I got
from a dying purple alien...
...in a swamp.
The epidermis is magenta,
appears transparent and
is extremely thin...
allowing visualization of muscles
and individual muscle fibers.
"To infinity and beyond!"
"By the power of Grayskull!"
What the hell!
Come on, if you can fly me a hundred miles
to the middle of nowhere, you'd think you...
<i>Brightest day, and blackest night,</i>
<i>No evil shall escape my sight.</i>
<i>Let those who worship evil's might</i>
<i>Beware my power,
Green Lantern's light.</i>
Carol.
- Is everything okay in there?
- Fine.
- Well, Can I come in?
- No. Yeah. No... Because...
Do you want to get a drink?
- Can we talk?
- Yeah, we can talk and drink.
- My initial analysis.
- Thank you, doctor.
I do not need to tell you that the mere fact
that it is humanoid, is extraordinary.
It is indicating
a convergent evolution,...
...or perhaps a common ancestry,
and the implications of that...
...are staggering!
Where did it come from?
This could completely change how
the world views itself.
Can you imagine how the public
will react to this?
But, I know that won't happen. I do.
Like yourself doctor,
I am a seeker of truth.
But the people who pay
for facilities like this,...
...have other priorities
and the power to enforce them.
So we have to keep it a secret.
People like us have to work
within the system, doctor.
We do the best we can.
Right.
- I am really sorry.
- Did you just apologize?
Have you ever been replaced
by an alien or something?
No. I'm good.
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm totally good. I...
Do you think I'm irresponsible?
No need to answer.
That's fine.
Hal...
You look pretty.
We haven't been in this place
together since...
...that night.
- You forgot that it was my birthday.
- Did I?
That was also the night
that was the first time we...
...flew together.
Well you've been flying ever since,
with anyone who would be on the plane.
Oh... Yeah...
- Come on!
- Oh... no.
- Let's go. Dance with me.
- No.
No.
No.
Hal, no.
No.
I really am sorry.
That's okay,
the contract is not over yet.
- I told you I was good at this.
- I wasn't talking about the contract.
I would have screwed this up.
Even if I didn't go
into the airforce,...
...I would have found some way to...
...you and me, were involved.
- Is that what you tell yourself?
- Yeah. What do you tell yourself?
That you were scared
that I was getting too close.
You know what I spent
my afternoon doing?
- What?
- Worrying about you.
Hal, I went over every inch
of the flight data,...
...there was nothing wrong with the plane.
- What happened up there was...
- Thanks for the dance.
I told you to watch your back, Jordan!
You cost us all our jobs,
you son-of-a-bitch.
You're pathetic.
Bastard has been living of his old man's
reputation his whole life.
My face is just getting warmed up.
Have you concluded admiring yourself?
Yeah.
Well, your ring translator
is functioning properly.
Your mask will appear when
protection of your identity is required.
There is no need for it on Oa.
- You're a talking fish.
- Actually, my race is Zudarian.
Our DNA does somewhat resemble
your own ecological species.
I am Tomar-Re,
Protector of Sector 2813, and home to...
...80,012 galaxies,
2.34 million celleon species.
How do I know that?
The induction process, it activates
the ring's higher functions,...
...including a working knowledge base.
In truth, we were curious,...
...the process had never been attempted
on a species as young as humans before.
As you are the first to be chosen,
I have been sent to welcome you here.
And here is?
Welcome to "Oa".
This planet has been our home
by countless millennia.
It was created for us
by the Guardians.
- Guardians?
- There stands their citadel.
They are immortals among
the most ancient of races.
They made all you see,...
...and are responsible
for all we are and do.
Since time immemorial,
the Green Lantern Corp,...
...served as the keepers of peace, order
and justice throughout the universe.
To be chosen to join its ranks,
is the highest of honors...
...and the greatest of responsibilities.
Yeah, that part I heard about.
We're going to fly now.
- Fly?
- Absolutely.
Alright! I can do that.
Join me.
I can do that.
Yeah!
What is that?
It's the energy that's generated
from the central battery.
It's power comes from the will
of every living creature in the universe.
It in turn, charges your lantern,
which in turn charges your ring.
Even your suit is comprised
entirely of energy.
What's with all the green?
Green is the color of will.
The Guardians harness will because...
... it's the strongest source
of energy in the universe.
There is so many...
The stars you can see from your
home planet on the clearest night,...
...your sector
is a thousand times larger,...
...and 3,600 lanterns
each with a sector...
...just as vast.
Lanterns...
I've called you here
for an unprecedented gathering,...
...because we face
an unprecedented danger.
Our four lantern brothers were killed
by a enemy called "Parallax".
The enemy we don't yet fully understand.
We do know that it is powerful enough
to destroy entire civilizations.
Powerful enough to defeat even,
Abin Sur,...
...our finest warrior.
His light can never be replaced.
The Guardians have charged me to lead...
...a squadron of our strongest Lanterns
on an assault on Parallax.
We will seek out and
find this enemy,...
...and we will destroy it.
Alone, we are vulnerable.
United, we are still invincible.
We have never been defeated.
- Will we be defeated now?
- No!
It was for this moment,
that we were created.
But I don't need to tell you
your duty...
I don't need to tell you,
who we are.
We are the Corp!
We are the Corp!
Your will turns thought
into reality.
To master the ring,
you must learn to focus your will...
...and create what you see in your mind.
The ring's limits are only
what you can imagine.
Do that again.
Now, you try it.
Concentrate.
The ring will inform you
where there is an imminent threat.
This particular threat's name is,
Kilowog.
He will be your combat training officer.
Never let your guard down, poozer.
Welcome to "Ring Slinging 101"...
...or as I like to call it,
the worst day of your worthless life.
The human, ain't never seen one before.
- You smell funny.
- I smell funny?
Yeah, I heard about humans.
Think you're the center of the universe.
You wanna be a Lantern,
you gotta commit to the Corp.
Alright, Poser. Let's see what you got.
Your constructs are only going
to be as strong as your will,...
...and your will is pathetic.
I'm going to work you,...
...and I'm going to hit you
until you're will is strong enough...
...to be worthy of the Corp.
Next lesson.
Feel that?
Just the gravitational pull
of your average sun.
Makes flying through space
very dangerou.
The bigger you are,
the quicker you burn.
Gravity's a bitch.
Here, let me help you.
Remember, your enemy,
he's not going to play fair.
Well, that's good advice.
- Thanks, gorgeous.
- So...
...this is the human.
When I learned Abin Sur's ring
had chosen you,...
...I said there had to be a mistake.
I see nothing to change my mind.
I'll take it from here, Kilowog.
The Corp is only as strong
as its weakest link...
...and I will tolerate no weaklings.
Understand me?
Do you afraid, human?
Do you afraid?
Don't...
Don't do that.
Shall we?
Sure.
A sword... How, human.
I do believe I smell fear.
I'm a Green Lantern,
I fear nothing.
Fear is the enemy of will.
Will, is what lets you take action.
Fear is what stops you,
and makes you weak.
And makes your constructs,
feeble.
You must ignore your fear.
If you are afraid, you can't act.
If you can't act, you can't defend it.
If you can't defend, you die.
You reek of fear, Hal Jordan.
Abin Sur, was a great warrior.
My mentor. My friend.
You insult his memory
by wearing his ring.
I'm done.
He's right, I'm only human.
We're not ready to defend
the universe.
Up until a few days ago, we thought
we were the only ones in the unverse.
The ring chose you.
It wouldn't have done so if it hadn't
seen something in you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Something you yourself don't yet see.
- The ring never makes a mistake.
- This time it did.
Many of these little critters,
that we have been calling bacteria...
...weren't bacteria at all.
They were entirely different type...
...of primitive prokaryotic cell.
These little buggers called "Archaeans",
are still poorly understood.
But might turn out to be different
from bacteria.
But might turn out to be
as different from bacteria...
...as bacteria is from us.
Some people call them
"extremophiles",...
...because they live in the most extreme
enviroments on earth, such as...
<i>It's so boring.</i>
...the boiling waters of a geyser.
<i>What a looser.</i>
Michael! What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
Did you just call me a looser?
<i>Holy shit!
What kind of freek is this?</i>
Freek?!
What happened?
That's crazy.
Class dismissed.
MESSAGE:
"My office at 3pm, be there, Dad"
How you've been?
Been a while.
Looks like you had a rough night last night.
Did you get her name, huh?
You need to get some sleep, son.
- Have a seat.
- What can I do for you, dad?
Well, actually you've already done it.
For me and for your country.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you impressing
a whole lot of very important people.
Where did you get that?
I'm on a subcommittee,
overseeing the agencies involved.
- There are top secret...
- It was you...
That's why they chose me.
Because of this, we're going to be able
to get you a top post on the inside now.
Helping oversee the entire operation.
There are scientists that
work there whole life for this,...
...people more qualified.
And less connected. Don't be naive, son.
It's the way the world works.
You have to seize an opportunity
when it presents itself.
<i>He'll never get it, just wasting his life away.
What an embarrassment.</i>
Bill, how are you?
I'm terrific.
No, no, just finishing up a meeting.
Got plenty of time.
SECTOR 2312
Edge of the Milky Way galaxy
<i>With my own eyes, I saw this creature,
induce fear in our finest warriors,...</i>
...and then fed on that fear.
There's more. We tracked its trajectory.
Parallax is headed for Oa.
Never before has an enemy dared
attack us here.
You must tell me what you know.
Will has always been our sole weapon...
...against the forces of darkness
in the universe.
But, as that power began
to seem insufficient,...
...a great debate arose among us.
Should we exploit
another source of power,...
...one we had long since sworn should
never be used.
Fear.
But the power of fear,
was too unpredictable.
The change of corruption, too great.
And so we decided against it.
<i>All of us, that is, except one.</i>
<i>Alone, this Guardian entered
the forbidden chamber.</i>
<i>He wanted to prove the light
of fear could be mastered.</i>
<i>His intensions were pure.
But, his hopes were naive.</i>
<i>Consumed by the yellow power
of fear,...</i>
<i>...the Guardian became the evil
he had wished to destroy.</i>
<i>He became "Parallax".</i>
For the universe's safety
and his own,...
...Abin Sur was charged
with imprisoning Parallax...
...in the lost sector.
- But he escaped.
Feeding on the fear of others,
he grew larger, more powerful.
And is now headed here...
...to take his revenge on you
and destroy the Corp.
Then we have no choice.
We must prepare to harness
the power of our enemy...
...and fight fear with fear.
To protect our sectors,
we must be able to defend ourselves.
We must forge a yellow ring.
Good evening, sir.
Watch your step!
- Hello.
- Hey.
Rough night, huh?
Hector. How you doing?
What have you been up to?
- Same old, same old.
- Yeah, me too.
Hal Jordan, the worst pilot
I've ever seen,..
...or the best. I'm not sure.
- I've been called both, sir.
I'm glad you made it, son.
Frankly, I was a little surprised
I got the invite.
Well, you're family, Hal.
You know I always say there are thinkers
in this world and there are doers.
And you, are one of the doers.
Yeah, but you know the thinkers make
what I do possible.
I wouldn't have a plane to fly in
unless someone thought it up.
Of course.
Excuse me, I need a drink.
And I gotta get back to work.
- This is work.
- Yes, sir.
- Nice to see you.
- You, too. You, too.
Nice.
Yeah, my dad used to train in them.
I was talking about your dress.
Nice jacket.
The last time I checked,
you didn't even own one.
Yeah, I've been enriching
my wardrobe lately.
Congratulations on the contract.
How did you manage to pull that off?
I pointed out that you only won because
you broke the rules of engagement.
And Tom figured out how to give
the Sabers more altitude.
So, I guess, in a way, without even
meaning to, you actually did us a favor.
Look, I'm uncomfortable
with the word, "Hero".
Thank you, thank you all
for joining us. Great evening!
Somebody very special I'd like to thank
for helping us to nail this contract.
My daughter, Carol Ferris.
Come on!
Congratulations, Carol.
I take one look at you young lady,
or Hal Jordan over there...
...splitting image of his dad.
You give us hope.
A toast to our future.
To future!
We're in good hands.
Hector! Oh my god, hey!
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
- Here's to you and Hal, the future.
- Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry.
I know it couldn't have been easy,
growing up with your dad.
But hey, your doing great, so...
I am. I'm doing great,
he's right thought, I'm not a doer.
Although, I did get to examine
an alien body recently,...
...that was very cool.
I can't tell anyone about it but,
hey, you can't have everything...
You're telling another one
of his science fiction stories?
<i>What the hell is wrong with him?
He can't keep his mouth shut.</i>
You really do have
a creative imagination.
Bye.
Senator, I apologize.
We really must go.
Good night, Carol.
- Senator.
- Hey!
Senator, thanks for everything.
Goodbye, senator!
Get the crash crew here,
our helicopter is going down.
Oh, my God!
<i>What is it? What is that?</i>
<i>He flies.</i>
<i>...they will be talking about it
for years to come.</i>
<i>A helicopter, spinning out of control,
heading for almost certain tragedy,...</i>
<i>...when all of a sudden, a mystery man,
a hero, saved the day,...</i>
<i>...by incredibly diverting a helicopter
from destroying innocent people.</i>
<i>And miraculously saving Carol Ferris,...</i>
<i>...from being crushed by a
collapsing billboard.</i>
<i>The real question tonight is:...</i>
<i>...Who is this amazing hero,
and where is he now?</i>
Start talking.
- A race track?
- Yeah.
That's the best you could come up with,
for your first big appearance.
- A race track?
- I'm sorry. Did I disappoint you?
I materialized a race track
out of pure energy,...
...saving hundreds of people,
and your disappointed.
I'm sorry about that.
No, I want to see this stuff.
You're going to have to show me.
- No, I don't think that is a good idea.
- Come on. I want to see this stuff.
- I want to see the outfit...
- I'm sitting here in my apartment!
...the flying, you've got to show me...
- What do you want me to do?
...I love you, but being your best friend...
- I've just got up. Give me a little space.
- It's for emergency heads up...
- You owe me!
Hal, I want to see it.
Fine!
Hold on to your glasses.
Question...
- Are you ready to have your mind blown?
- Yes.
Ring. Finger.
Here we go.
- Did you break it already?
- I didn't break it, okay? It's just...
It's out of juice,
I have to recharge it.
Now, pay attention.
Ahh, green.
- Wow!
- I know, right?
- Not bad, huh?
- You're a super hero!
Don't they always get the girl?
Good evening, Mame.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Are you okay?
Yeah, no, I'm... I'm glad
to have a chance to thank you.
Just doing my job.
No thanks are necessary, Miss.
No, it is. You saved my life.
You saved all of our lives.
That was a very...
- Hal?
- Miss?
Hal?!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my God, Hal!
How did you know that it was me.
What do you mean!
I've known you my whole life!
I've seen you naked!
You don't think I would recognize you,
because I can't see your cheek bones?
What is this?
Why is your skin green?
Why are you glowing?
What the hell is with that mask?
It came with the outfit.
Cool, huh?
So it all works because
of this magic ring?
No, there is no such thing as magic.
Intergalactic green peace keepers,
thousands of them, but no.
I'm not making it up.
Well, I remember when we were kids,
who would have thought.
I did, actually.
I called this early on... and said...
...one day, I'll be a green
space goblin. Here I am.
Okay, so at the party, how did you
make that big green ramp thing?
Anything I see in my mind,
I can create. I just have to focus.
- Anything?
- Anything.
Happy birthday!
Better late than never.
Okay, so how does it work,
they just call you on your cell...
...cat in a tree in downtown
of the Milky Way?
No, I don't think it works
exactly like that.
Well, technically speaking...
...I actually, sort of, quit.
- What do you mean? How?
- It's a lot like quiting anything else, really.
I don't understand, how do you walk away
from something like that? Is it even possible?
Oh, I think we both know
I'm pretty good at walking away.
If for once, you didn't quit something
you cared about...
...what's the worst that can happen?
Well, thank you.
This has been really...
- I know, I've made a lot of mistakes.
- Look, Hal, I'm not mad at you.
I feel bad for you, really.
You've been given so much, so often.
I just...
Good night.
Dr. Hammond.
There's something I'd like to show you.
I'm fairly certain you will want to see it.
<i>- Later, Mom.
- I love you!</i>
<i>Bye, sweety.</i>
Physical contact accessses
mnemonic data.
I can see your memories.
Dad.
Son, this is my fault.
But, I'm going to fix it.
We're going to get you well again,
whatever it takes.
I don't know what you're talking about.
We detected traces of
a second alien life form...
...buried within the body of the first.
You've been exposed.
I've never felt better in my life.
We know everything, son.
I've never felt better in my life!
<i>To be chosen to join its ranks,
it the highest of honors...</i>
<i>...and the greatest of responsibilities.</i>
<i>The ring never makes a mistake.</i>
You're gonna be alright. They just
need to run some tests, that's all.
Keep him under.
I only want what's best for you.
Run!
Hector...
Don't worry.
I only want what's best for you.
<i>The ring, it chose you.</i>
<i>Take it!</i>
Hal, hi.
The alien was one of you.
How did we end up
so different?
Sit down!
Now...
How's Carol?
<i>- I came out and...
- Please...</i>
<i>I know, I've made a lot of mistakes.</i>
<i>Look, Hal, I feel bad for you, really.
Good night.</i>
You're just as much of
a failure as I was...
...and just as afraid.
I used to fight my fear...
...but now, that I have tasted
it's true power.
I'll never go back.
No!
You have the ring of the Lantern
that imprisoned me.
You will suffer the same fate.
Once I have devoured your world,
I will have all the strength I need...
...to defeat the Corp and
destroy the Guardians.
Let me get this straight.
This thing that's out there attacking
planets is connected to Hector?
Somehow it infected him,
after it killed Abin Sur.
- Well, your just going to have to stop it.
- Oh, I'm just gonna have to stop it.
Well, I tried that and I failed
then the senator died.
- I told you the ring made a mistake.
- Way go back. How did the ring make a mistake?
The one thing that a Green Lantern
is supposed to be is fearless.
Fearless is the job description.
- That isn't me.
- So, you're just going to walk away, again.
Explain this to me, Hal.
Please, explain to me just once, why?
Because I'm afraid!
You don't think your dad
ever felt afraid?
If he did, he would
figure out some way to bet it.
Yeah, well, there is a word for that,...
...courage.
They said that the ring wouldn't
have chosen me if it didn't see something...
...something I don't see, yet.
I see it. I always have.
The ring didn't see that
you were fearless.
It saw you had the ability
to overcome fear.
It saw that you were courageous.
But you are, just like your dad.
<i>The Lantern is a threat...</i>
<i>...eliminate him.</i>
Our new weapon is ready.
Once I have mastered it's power, I will
begin training the Corp to do the same.
The Earth will be lost.
But we'll be ready to make a stand
against Parallax before it reaches Oa.
And the power of the enemy,
will be ours.
At what cost?
- You dare enter this chamber.
- I need your help.
You have got to help me
save my world.
I know that humans aren't
the strongest species or the smartest.
We're young, we have a lot to learn,
but we're worth saving.
This new weapon of yours,
you can't use it.
Once you cross that line,
once you've given into fear...
...you'll never go back.
I've seen it.
Look, I know right now you're afraid.
You dare accuse the Guardians
of feeling fear?
Yes, I do.
And that is exactly what Parallax
is feeding you...
...because you are afraid
to even admit you're afraid.
I know.
I spent my entire life doing it.
You know, we have a saying on Earth.
We say, "I'm only human".
We say it because we're vulnerable,
we say it because we know we're afraid.
That doesn't mean we're weak.
Help me save my planet.
Don't give into fear.
Fight it...
Fight it with me.
Your words are compelling,
young human.
But as immortals, we must measure
our actions over billions of years...
...and the fate of the universe.
We simply can not risk loosing everything,
on the chance that you might be right.
Then don't, don't risk
anymore lives... just mine.
Let me go fight for my world...
...and I will show you that will,
is stronger than fear.
There is no way you can succeed.
You will die, Hal Jordan.
Then, I'll die trying.
Good luck, Green Lantern.
I wouldn't do that.
Look closely.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
I loved her from the moment
I first saw her.
But she could never see me because
you were always standing in the way.
But, not anymore.
No! No! Don't!
Don't do this, Hector! Please!
Please!
I know how you feel.
Come on, look at yourself.
I know what it's like,
to not live up to expectations...
...to feel that nothing you do,
will ever be good enough.
I know what it's like to be afraid.
Let me help you.
Hal, you've changed.
How wonderful, but all it took for you
to grow up, was the end of the world.
Now, it's my turn.
And if I can't be like you,
then I'm gonna make her like me.
And let's face it,
once she's like me...
...and you wouldn't be very interested.
Hmm, now will you?
Why can't you?
Why can't you be like me?
Let her go...
...and you can have it.
You can do anything,
be anything.
Take it.
Let her make the choice.
Okay.
Wow!
Now, bring her down.
Hal...
I lied.
I lied too.
You see, the way it works is,
you have to be chosen.
You have failed me!
- Stay here.
- No problem.
<i>X-97 Development Project</i>
Your will is strong,
but not strong enough.
You are nothing without the ring.
<i>You must move out of the area, now.</i>
<i>Please clear the streets.</i>
<i>Clear the streets, immediately.</i>
- You can never beat this, you'll die.
- At least I can get it away from here.
- How do you think your gonna do that?
- I don't know... I don't... I don't know.
Maybe, I can out think it.
The dog fight, remember?
- Those were a couple of jets.
- Unbeatable jets.
The ring chose me for a reason,
this is why.
- Look, I'll... probably not...
- Please, don't do this.
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation.
Everyone just clear the streets, immediately.</i>
<i>This is an emergency,
everyone must clear the streets, now!</i>
- What the hell is that thing?
- Run!
Watch out! Watch out!
Everybody out now! Now!
Go! Go!
Run!
I feel your fear growing.
- You will be dead soon.
- In brightest day,...
...in blackest night...
- And when you're gone...
...I'll destroy everything,
you ever loved.
No evil shall escape my sight...
Your family, your home,
your planet will be no more.
Those who worship,
evils might...
The entire human race will be wiped out
because you, Hal Jordan, are afraid.
Beware my power...
Green Lantern's light!
The bigger you are,
the faster you burn.
Though his time wearing the ring
has been brief,...
...Hal Jordan's defeat of Parallax,...
...will be remembered as long
as the Corp exists.
His actions, are a reminder
of why the ring chose each of us.
To overcome fear, and destroy evil
wherever it may hide.
As Lanterns, we must fight
with all our will.
Our wills haven't always been united.
It's time they were.
Can I train him,
or can I train them.
You're impertinent, Hal Jordon.
You're rash, volatile, opinionated.
It seems Abin Sur found another,
just like himself.
Wow, I'm never getting used to that.
My new job requires that I travel.
I'll be away for a while.
Away, never gone.
- Hal.
- Yeah?
Can you take off the mask?
That's really cool.
- So what happens now?
- I'm gonna look for trouble.
<i>Of all the Lanterns who have ever
worn the ring,...</i>
<i>...there was one whose light
shined brightest.</i>
<i>At first, his humanity was thought
to be a weakness.</i>
<i>And yet it proved to be his
greatest strength.</i>
