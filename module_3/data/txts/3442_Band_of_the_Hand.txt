<i>- Oye,</i> come on, <i>maricón!</i>
Come on, man!
- Come on!
- Try me!
Let 'em kill each other. I'm tired
of their nigger-spick bullshit.
You! You too.
All of you.
You want it that way?
You try me.
<i>- Oye,</i> man, where you going?
- Supermarket.
Try not to kill each other.
Yo, Crazy!
Let me check that out.
Too small for me.
Go do mine now.
Your ears don't work?
Go ahead!
You do good work.
The rest of you drag-asses,
you need help?
When he's done with mine...
I might rent you Crazy here.
That's not bad.
What's in here anyway?
Cattail, milkweed, wild onion,
other things.
What's this chewy stuff?
Snails.
Snails them worms in a shell?
Main course.
Worms! I can't eat this!
It's zoo food!
I want a cheeseburger.
Escargot and frog legs.
You know what this would set you back
at Regine's in the Grove?
About a hundred with the wine.
Next thing you know,
he's having us eat turtle shit...
alligator dick.
- Joe, what's that white stuff?
- Termite eggs.
Protein.
Anyone for seconds?
I want some black-eyed peas
and rice.
Sweet potato pi...
Get me down from here!
Crazy, I'm gonna kill you!
Get me down!
I can't take it!
Crazy, that's it for you
when I get down from here.
I'm getting sick!
Yo, I can't wait!
God! Crazy, get me down from here!
It's gonna be your ass
when I get down!
Hey, <i>chango.</i>
Carlos! Wake up, man!
Rattler's gone.
So's the Indian.
- He got something!
- Come on!
- Yo, let me have it!
- Don't let go of it! Come on!
Don't let go of it!
- You're pulling it too tight!
- Yo, Carlos, man! Shut up!
- What do you know about fishing?
- You don't know nothing either!
- Let me pull it in!
- You gotta get in everything.
- Let me pull...
- Don't let that fish go!
Don't, Moss!
That fish'll take one look at you,
and run the other way!
- Don't be stupid, man!
- You're gonna lose it!
- Get it, Moss! Get it!
- I got it!
You're pulling it too tight!
Come on, Moss, man!
What do you mean,
he's pulling it too tight?
Oh, shut up, Carlos, man!
You don't know nothing about fishing!
- All right! All right!
- Yeah!
- He dead?
- What do you care?
He took two hits.
That's a lot of venom.
I shot him up.
He's got a fifty-fifty chance.
<i>Mi pana,</i> Flaco,
sitting right next to me.
Car came by full of Latin Kings.
Boom, boom! Dead.
I ain't got a scratch.
Here, grab his legs.
Grab his arms!
Okay. Okay, breathe.
Easy.
Easy.
<i>Oye! El Rattler</i> lives!
Nikki. Come in.
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Quintana.
Sit down. Have a drink.
Felix.
No, that's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Quintana.
Maybe Perrier.
Have you heard from Carlos?
Not a word.
Nothing.
I've been making calls.
I can't find out where he is.
I thought you might know.
One day I went to see him
at the youth hall.
The next day he was gone.
They tell me your family
has money up in Palm Beach.
I don't talk to them.
They don't talk to each other,
and they don't care what I do.
Works out fine.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
Good. Smart girl.
You know how to handle yourself.
You think you'll be able to find out
where Carlos is and get him out?
Sure. Sure I will.
Now you go upstairs
into the bedroom.
Take off your clothes.
I got a few more things
to take care of down here...
and then I'll come up.
I said go upstairs,
take off your fucking clothes.
A cloven hoof.
Wild boar.
We'll find other game.
Nobody hunts boar.
Except a few wild men who think
they're good eating.
- Let's get out of here! Move it!
- Oh, shit!
- Hurry up!
- Keep going, man!
It thinks we're stick people!
<i>Jesucristo!</i>
Hurry up, Moss!
- Move guys!
- Shit!
Hey, wait a minute!
- Get out of my way, man!
- Hey, come on!
Shit, that thing is ugly, man!
Come on, guys!
Let's get him!
Man, barbecue!
All we need is some rib sauce
from Mokey's on 27 th Avenue.
Man, this is a lot better
than an alley cat.
I ate an alley cat once
goin' through Detroit.
Detroit? Miami.
<i>Calle Ocho,</i> Little Havana!
27 th Avenue! Get down and boogie!
- Nikki.
- Oh, man! Nikki again.
Lots of mommies happy
when Ruben hits the streets.
And what's they doin'
while you away, homie?
Improvin' themselves.
Like us. Ask this guy.
You can say that again.
- Don't mess with the best.
- Exam time.
Map. Compass.
Destination is marked.
You track me, you should get out alive.
See ya.
He's joking, ain't he?
We've been through here already.
Which way's what, man?
Rattler's got the map.
I can't read.
Oh, shit!
- Why didn't you tell us before, man?
- Because I didn't!
That way.
<i>Oye,</i> Carlos!
Can you read, man?
Hey, wait up,J.L.
We gotta keep moving northeast.
That way.
Man, you lostJoe's trail.
Let me see.
Man, you don't know shit, man.
Give me that compass!
- Give me the compass!
- No way, Jose!
Now what you gonna do?
- I'm gonna kill you this time, spick.
- Stop!
I'm gonna kill you!
Stop!
What are you doin'?
If we don't learn to live,
we're gonna die likeJoe said, man.
So come on!
Come on!
You lost the compass, find it!
Now!
Assholes.
Saw grass.
Cut the shit outta you!
Piss on this.
This is worse than work.
My turn.
You're havin' all the fun.
Northeast, almost.
Whoever's snoring,
shut the hell up!
Wake up!
Gimme a stick! Come on, guys!
- Get outta here!
- Do something!
- Get outta here!
- Yeah. Get out of here!
I done fought everything, but I never
fought a bear! Get outta here!
Oh, Joe!
Hey, wake up!
Smokey the Bear's gone.
Panther.
Maybe the compass is broken.
Check it against the North Star.
There's no North Star!
It's still daylight!
- Check it against the sun.
- Another night.
And more water!
More water!
Listen.
Hey, look!
Joe! It's Joe!
Right there!
Look! Joe!
- We made it!
- All right!
How you doin', man?
- Hey, we made it, man!
- Hey, man, we saw a panther!
- Anyone else see a panther?
- How'd those guys do?
- Weren't no others.
- What?
You're the first.
The first?
What do you mean, the first?
We could've died out there.
We're the first, man.
That's right man.
We're <i>numero uno.</i>
Yeah, we the best!
We number one! All right!
We the shit!
You ready for Miami?
You mean, we're out?
Free?
No.
I got us a house.
Program's movin' to Miami.
This is it?
- How'd you get this house?
- From the city. Dollar a year.
Well, you got screwed.
What are we supposed to do with them?
Haitians is scurvy!
- No shit.
- What do you wanna do with 'em?
- Throw 'em out!
- Junkies too, man!
Hey, man, they're the worst!
They'll sell you out for a nickel bag!
I am <i>puertorriqueño,</i> man!
I ain't no raggedy-ass Haitian!
And look at this place.
It's disgusting!
- It's not so bad.
- Yeah, it looks like home to you.
Man, look, what are we doin',
runnin' a hotel, here?
You guys afraid you haven't
got enough to go around?
Around what?
Around the block for a bit of shit?
Yo, there's junkies here!
- Same question goes.
- What's that?
- You got the balls?
- To what?
Cut it in Miami.
- Cut the shit, okay, man?
- Man, what the hell does that mean?
- Hey, man...
- Shut up!
Is that in our house?
What'd you take
those boards down for?
- We use this place the way it is.
- We're movin' in. You're movin' out.
Oh, yeah?
Well, who's doin' the movin'?
We are!
I'll bust you upside your head!
- You want us, we'll be in the park.
- Well, go on right now!
Get outta here! Give me a hand.
He weighs a lot for a junkie.
Get your ass across the street.
I do not believe this.
I don't believe this!
This is who you let
run you outta the house, man?
Five punks and Tonto.
What's this sign here?
Ain't no pimps and pushers around here.
You see any?
Hey, who was that?
That's Cream. Everybody knows him.
He runs this part of town.
Yo, nobody messes with that man,
not even the police.
- What are we gonna do about that?
- Nothing. Mail this.
Here's $125.
You take that to Power and Gas
over on the Avenue.
The man will show you
where to sign your name.
You learned that already.
Hey, Joe?
What's to keep me from takin' a hike?
Nothing.
I gotta go.
Hey, Aldo!
Hey, Carlos! My man!
You look different, huh?
Gina, this is my main man, Carlos.
We did some bad moves together.
Listen, your timing is perfect,
man, okay?
Because Gina's got a little friend
who's gonna be flyin' by later on.
- You get a line on Nikki?
- Crystal's a major fox!
I gotta find Nikki.
Okay, I'll be in touch.
Carlos.
I don't got a phone number,
but I got an address. It's in the Grove.
You go dressed like that,
you're gonna get busted for nothin'.
Come on up.
All right, all right.
You don't know how much
I've been missing you.
Hey, whose place is this?
Mine.
Talking to your father now?
Uh-uh. Never.
A condo like this is big dollars.
Well, it's not exactly mine.
Kathy, you know,
my friend from Palm Beach?
She's in Europe.
She lent it to me.
- Men's cologne. This Kathy's?
- That's mine.
I use it. It's fun.
What's going down?
Why was it so hard
to find you?
I'm in the business now.
- I'm working for Nestor.
- Working for Nestor.
- You're fucking him!
- No, Carlos. I swear.
You bitch!
You lying whore! You <i>puta!</i>
Wait! Carlos, you don't know!
- I know enough!
- Listen, please!
Carlos! Wait!
Carlito.
You're looking good.
Nikki, come here.
Now you got nothin'.
Go on.
Get lost.
You're out of Miami.
Hey, yo, man! Look, man!
Hey, look, man!
Hey, man, we heard
you livin' here with them.
You swore you were gonna
waste that nigger!
Hey, man, you watch it!
Quiet!
I been waiting on them brushes.
What's up?
- You got it.
- Oh, what?
- We don't take that shit.
- What you talkin' about?
Yo, cupcake!
- You paint like my Aunt Mary!
- Hey, man, what you doin', paintin'?
- Hey, look at that, man!
- Hey, yo, Rembrandt!
You ain't worth a shit, man!
Moss is painting himself
yellow like a chicken!
Think you can do better, jack-off?
Home slice! You don't see
those spots you missin'?
- Got your contact lenses in?
<i>- Mira,</i> Chooch.
Not on the glass, man, okay?
And don't get the yellow on the pink!
- What you wearin' a doo-rag like that?
- Yo! What you doing over here?
Yo, bubble butt!
Yo, how's your sister Yolanda?
Yo, man, Moss, your guys
are really bad, man.
Look what they doin', man.
They gettin' paint everywhere.
<i>Oye,</i> the lover!
I knew you'd be back, man.
You was just horny.
Catch them vines!
Silk, baby.
This Nikki, she got a sister?
When we gonna see her?
Antoine's going to plant a garden.
Good.
- I'm glad we could get...
- Hold on, hold on.
Get Harvey and Inez. Ask them if they
want to eat at Cats tonight, okay?
<i>Yes, Mr. Chavez.</i>
- You'reJoe Tigre.
- You've read the reports.
We're coming up
for 90-day funding...
I haven't gotten to them.
I'll try this weekend.
The funding review
is set for Tuesday.
<i>They said they'll meet you</i>
<i>for dinner at 8:00.</i>
Thank you.
Sorry. You were saying?
The funding review is Tuesday.
I'd like to know where you stand.
- Campaigning, are we?
- Where do you stand?
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is it all in the reports?
- Yes.
Well, then I don't have
to read them, do I?
Then you'll approve?
Well, we try these programs on.
They look good on paper.
Draws federal funds.
But the fact is we find out that
half the personnel are moving junk.
Three months ago,
we had a halfway house for girls...
running an outcall service
on the side.
- Look, I'm running late, so...
- Listen, friend.
This program is important.
Last one you had, two of your kids
got killed robbing a 7-Eleven.
That halfway house you had
in Overtown, real successful.
Listen to me. Each of these kids
has learned how to survive.
Each one of these kids
has learned self-esteem.
Each of these kids
means something to himself now.
Now that means
that other people's lives...
other people's rights
mean something too.
You understand?
They've changed.
We've broken down
the gang barriers, the race barriers.
They work together. A team.
A band. The program works.
How long you had these ideas?
What the hell is wrong
with my ideas?
One of your kids gets busted...
misdemeanor, spitting on the sidewalk...
I'm gonna put 'em all back
where they belong.
I'll see you on Tuesday.
Stay out!
That's enough!
That's enough!
I said that's enough!
- Gotta teach 'em some respect!
- There's another way!
Get out of here, bitch!
Don't bring your ass back!
You mothers! Get out!
Carlos, cool it! Get off him!
I said get off him!
Get outta here!
All right! All right!
- They ran like skeeter-jeeter.
- You know it, baby!
- I told you all to stay out of it.
- You want us to watch you get killed?
- Move it out.
- Come on, give it back.
Let's go!
All right!
You have got to be kidding, right?
I mean, what you gonna do, Tonto?
You gonna take over
my territory?
Don't you know
this park is mine?
You lookin' to die, Tonto?
Yeah. Now you wisin' up.
Tell them to put down the guns.
- Now!
- Put 'em down.
I said put 'em down.
- All of'em.
- You heard him!
Collect 'em.
Don't play with 'em.
You should've killed me, Tonto.
- You should've killed me.
- You get outta here!
And you take this with you!
Move! Move!
Get out!
That's enough!
You want to use a gun, you start with
respect, not your barrio bullshit!
You pop off rounds, the only one gets
hurt is a kid in an upstairs window.
- I'm not backin' up anymore.
- What does that mean?
Too many losses.
- Lost the guys.
- What guys?
The Band.
I lost the kids
back to the streets.
They OD'd. Got shot down
in nickel and dime robberies.
All the kids before you.
All the programs.
I lost all the causes.
I lost all the people.
I'm not backin' up anymore.
I'm not losing to Cream
when he comes.
You changed.
The streets don't change.
The streets will curve you back in.
You can't change the people
without changing the environment.
We cleaned up this house.
We cleaned out the park.
Next come the streets.
It's a straight line, see?
- What part of the program is this?
- This is my part of the program.
- Since when?
- Since right now.
You kids are out.
You're not part of this.
You got what they call
"self-esteem" now.
Class is over.
You graduated.
You kids are gonna boogie.
That's okay.
I'll cover you in my reports
as long as I can.
- What about you?
- I stay.
This is where the war is.
- That's heavy duty.
- That's what we are.
I'm with you.
- Whatever.
- What do we do first?
Learn.
Wind is from the right, allow three
feet for wind plus one foot for drift.
That's four feet.
Wind from the left...
allow three feet for wind,
subtract one foot for drift.
That's two feet. Clear?
You're spraying fire
all over the place.
You're waiting ammo.
You have a zone to cover. Cover it!
You're a perfect target.
Zigzag. Use your body.
Bob and weave.
Get over the wall. Get to cover!
So what's the big deal? L...
Each guy's life depends on all...
on each man doing his job.
You cover your zone.
You know the man on your right
has got your right covered.
You know the man on your left
will kill everything on your left.
You're all part of each other.
Fingers on a hand.
A fire team!
Let's retake the house... again.
I hear you got problems
with some street gang...
and some strong-arm Indian moving in,
put you in the hospital?
No, Mr. Quintana, you see,
I'm on top of the situation.
It's nothing but a bunch of punk kids
living across the street from the park.
So me and my people,
we go and we torch the place.
We dust them off. You don't have
to worry about your product...
'cause your sales be back
to where they was in no time at all.
- I guarantee it.
- Don't need you, man.
Your action is worth
steady, serious money.
If you can't handle it,
I've got people who can.
Nikki, cover yourself
when there's niggers around.
You take care of business
or get out of business.
Clean up the mess.
Come in.
Pretty sharp.
I'm leaving.
- Not comin' back this time.
- You asking me or telling me?
I got another war.
Same war.
You're just changing sides.
- Hey, I want what's mine.
- Drug business?
The life. Makes you feel
like you're somebody.
You think you'll get your girl
back that way?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.
Carlos, I've been
looking all over for you.
Wait a minute.
I'm leavin'.
I've got $10,000 cash.
We can go away together.
Far away.
You think I want your money,
you stupid bitch?
Go back to Nestor.
And fuck you too!
- Let go of me!
- How much did he pay? You <i>puta!</i>
Jesus Christ!
Please calm down!
Hurry up. All right, this is it.
You stay cool and you stay low.
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know. I can't see.
I've never been anywhere
but Miami.
Well, Cuba, but I was a kid.
- I can hardly remember.
- It's gonna be great.
I mean, we have enough money.
We can go anywhere we want.
Yeah, Nestor. That <i>cabron.</i>
I should kill him.
I'll never go back
to Miami.
Today on the boat he put a knife
through some guy's hand...
because he was
looking at me, he said.
But it was because of business.
Nestor was on the guy's boss,
some huge black dude...
because of some street kids
and an Indian...
- causing trouble and cutting into sales.
- What was that?
Some house on a park near Little Havana.
They're gonna hit it tonight.
What are you doing?
- Where's Joe?
- He's out there.
Let's go.
Get out! Come on!
Fuck this! Come on!
How is he? Carlos!
Come on, man.
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.
My God.
Look at the house.
Where's Dorcey?
I'm okay!
He's not...
Get the jeep.
Get the jeep!
Get the guns.
<i>So what now?</i>
Back to the slam.
Police get their hands on me.
Never. Not me.
We're on our own now.
Adios, amigos.
"Five... man...
marine...
unit...
decorated..."
- What's this word?
- "Posthumously."
It means after you're dead.
"Sole survivor of fire team
awarded Medal of Honor."
"Band of the Hand."
Joe said we're all
part of each other.
The fingers of a hand.
His signs.
Brujeria.
Black magic.
Nestor the guy
you worked for?
Cream was Nestor's trigger.
Nestor killed Joe.
Nestor's the man.
Let's take the man down.
Is everything set
with the Colombian?
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
In two weeks, I'm setting up the biggest
processing plant in North Miami.
Don't give me this
"Don't worry" crap.
So who's the courier
for my money?
Flamingo Torres.
Payoff's in Nassau.
I want him tailed until I fucking hear
the deposits are in.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
All right.
What about the kids?
You wanna do anything?
When you get around to it,
you take Nikki.
You do to her whatever you want,
then kill her.
Kids.
Nothin'. Nobody.
- Maybe he's sick.
- Go to a big hospital, no clinic.
Stays two minutes each time.
Ether.
Truck's moving.
Coffee beans, my ass.
$117.35.
Yo, mama, pay the man.
So what do you guys
need this stuff for anyway?
We're gonna plant a garden
and fertilize it with the nitrogen...
and if there's gophers,
we're going to get them with a trap.
If that doesn't work,
we're gonna use the gopher gas.
And if that doesn't work, we're gonna
cement it all in and paint it green.
There's no gophers
in this area.
Who do you think
you're talkin' to?
Armadillos. Those are the meanest
suckers you're ever gonna want to see.
I'll tell you how you
take care of'em.
Pour a little painting fluid out there
and make 'em drink it, okay?
That cuts off the oxygen
to their brain.
What you wanna do then is zap 'em
with a little fluorescent paint...
so you can see 'em
in the dark.
Then you can get behind 'em
with some reinforced tungsten steel...
you can get it around 'em
and... Johhny Ola.
Just cut their motor.
But you gotta kill 'em the first time.
'Cause if you don't, they get
this revenge thing in their mind...
and they come back
lookin' for you.
I grew up in Pecos.
You know where that is, in Texas?
Well, down there, the armadillos
grow to about nine feet tall.
They take babies away and...
Things are dangerous.
LikeJoe said, it's zones.
So I'll be on top, covering
the roof and front. Go.
I do my thing,
then fall back. Then?
I get to the left corner of the house so
I can cover the left flank. Meanwhile...
I cover the rights side of the house
from the right porch corner so...
So I can make it
to the front door.
If we don't make it
to that front porch, we're dead.
- How far we gotta be when it goes off?
- All the way back to the wire.
<i>Oye, mano,</i> it's a snap.
If everything goes A-okay...
we got maybe a one in a five chance
of pulling this thing off.
- The Colombian is here.
- All right. It's now. We're on.
Come on, we gotta go
with what we got.
- I need more time.
- We ain't got it. It's now or never.
Come on, bitch.
Let the big boys know you're here.
- What are we gonna do?
- Keep cutting.
You sure she's in heat?
Here they come.
Sure glad those dogs are horny.
- They're probably after a squirrel.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's nice, huh?
Air conditioning
sucks the ether out.
Filters it clean.
No smell outside.
There's nothing like this
anywhere in the States.
The switch!
The air conditioner! Turn it off!
- Get him!
- Tommy, come here!
Who the fuck is out there?
On the roof!
- Holy shit!
- I got 'em! I got 'em!
- Motherfucker's over there!
- Let's do it!
Behind you!
Get behind there!
Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on, let's go! Move it!
- Come on, let's go!
Yo, come on, man!
Come on!
Give me the gun, Nikki.
Come on,J.L., blow it!
Come on! Come on, blow it!
Joe should've been here.
We did what he wanted,
didn't we?
There's nothing we can't do.
Hi, Officer.
What happened back there?
Yeah. We could see that fire
back in Homestead.
I don't know, kids. You know
as much as I do. Where you headed?
Miami.
- We gotta jam!
- Yeah!
Easy on the beer, huh?
Drive safe.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Officer!
- See ya later!
- Have a good night, Officer!
