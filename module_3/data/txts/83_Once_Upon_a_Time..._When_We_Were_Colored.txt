(grunts and pants)
You're too late.
No.
No!
Open it.
I'm sorry. She's gone.
At least let me say
good-bye.
(whooshing)
(gasps)
(pants)
You.
You found me.
Did you ever doubt
I would?
Truthfully...
The glass coffin
gave me pause.
Well, you never have to worry.
I will always find you.
Do you promise?
I do.
And do you, snow white,
Promise to take this man
to be your husband
And love him
for all eternity?
I do.
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
(cheering)
Hey.
Mm?
(door bangs open)
(crowd gasping)
Sorry I'm late.
(whoosh)
(women scream)
It's the queen. Run!
(blade whooshes)
She's not a queen anymore.
(indistinct whispering)
She's nothing more than
an evil witch.
No, no, no. Don't stoop
to her level. There's no need.
You're wasting your time.
You've already lost,
And I will not let you ruin
this wedding.
Oh, I haven't come here
to ruin anything.
On the contrary, dear.
I've come to give you
a gift.
We want nothing from you.
But you shall have it.
My gift to you...
Is this happy, happy day,
For tomorrow
my real work begins.
You've made your vows.
Now I make mine.
Soon everything you love,
Everything <i>all</i> of you love
Will be taken from you forever,
And out of your suffering
Will rise my victory.
I shall destroy your happiness,
If it is the last thing I do.
Hey!
(grunts)
(whoosh)
(crowd murmurs)
That a good book?
This?
It's more than just a book.
Oh. (chuckles)
<i>(man over p.A.)</i>
<i>boston south station.</i>
<i>Thank you for riding greyhound.</i>
(sirens wailing, horns honking)
I don't know...
Hold on.
(window whirring)
Uh, you take credit cards?
Where to, chief?
(elevator bell dings)
(indistinct conversations)
Emma?
Ryan?
(chuckles)
You look relieved.
Uh, well, it <i>is</i> the internet.
Pictures can be...
Fake, outdated,
Stolen from
a Victoria's Secret catalog.
(both laugh)
Exactly.
So...
So... Um, tell me something
about yourself, Emma.
Oh, uh, well...
Today's my birthday.
And you're spending it
with me?
What about your friends?
Kind of a loner.
And... You don't like
your family?
No family to like.
Oh, come on.
Everyone has a family.
Technically, yeah,
But not everyone knows
who they are.
Ready to run yet?
(chuckles) oh, not a chance.
You, Emma, are, by far,
The sexiest friendless orphan
that I have ever met.
(both laugh)
Okay. Your turn.
No, wait. Let me guess.
Um, you are handsome,
charming...
Go on.
The kind of guy who...
And now stop me
if I get this wrong...
Embezzled
from your employer,
Got arrested,
and skipped town
Before they were able
to throw your ass in jail.
(chuckles) what?
And the worst part of all
of this is your wife.
Your wife loves you so much
that she bailed you out,
And how do you repay
that loyalty?
You're on a date.
Who are you?
The chick who put up
the rest of the money.
You're a bail bondsman.
A bail bondsperson.
(chuckles)

Look, you don't have
to do this, okay?
I can pay you.
I've got money.
No, you don't,
and if you did,
You should give it to your wife
to take care of your family.
What the hell do you know
about family, huh?
(grunts)
(horn honks)
Nothing. (sighs)
(door closes)
Another banner year.
(blows air)
(doorbell rings)
Uh...
Can I help you?
Are you Emma swan?
Yeah. Who are you?
My name's Henry.
I'm your son.
Whoa. Hey, kid.
Kid. Kid!
I don't have a son.
Where are your parents?
Ten years ago, did you give up
a baby for adoption?
That was me.
Give me a minute.
(panting)
Hey, you have any juice?
Never mind. Found some.
(sighs)
You know, we should probably
get going.
Going where?
I want you to come home
with me.
Okay, kid.
I'm calling the cops.
Then I'll tell them
you kidnapped me.
(clicks, dial tone sounds)
And they'll believe you,
Because I'm
your birth mother.
(beep)
Yep.
You're not gonna do that.
Try me.
You're pretty good,
but here's the thing.
There's not a lot
I'm great at in life,
But I have one skill.
Let's call it a superpower.
I can tell
when anyone is lying,
And you, kid, are.
(click, dial tone sounds)
(beeps)
Wait.
Please don't call the cops.
Please.
Come home with me.
Where's home?
Storybrooke, Maine.
Storybrooke? Seriously?
Mm-hmm.
All righty then.
Let's get you back
to Storybrooke.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're thinking about
what the queen said again,
Aren't you?
Snow, please. I can't keep
having this conversation.
You have to let it go.
We're about to have a baby.
I haven't had a restful night
since our wedding.
That's what she wants,
to get in your head,
But they're only words.
She can't hurt us.
She poisoned an apple
Because she thought
I was prettier than her.
You have no idea
of what she's capable.
(sighs) what can I do
to ease your mind?
(gasps)
let me talk... To him.
Him?
You don't mean...
I do.
No. No, no.
It's too dangerous.
He sees the future.
There's a reason
he's locked up.
Can you promise me
that our child will be safe?
Can you guarantee it?
Because he <i>can.</i>
(sighs)
All right.
For our child.
(siren wailing, horn honks)
(Henry) I'm hungry.
Do you want to stop somewhere?
This is not a road trip.
We're not stopping for snacks.
Why not?
Quit complaining, kid.
Remember, I could have put
your butt on a bus.
I still could.
You know, I have a name.
It's Henry.
(sighs)
What's that?
I'm not sure you're ready.
Ready for some fairy tales?
They're not fairy tales.
They're true.
Every story in this book
actually happened.
Of course it did.
Use your superpower.
See if I'm lying.
Just because you believe
something doesn't make it true.
That's exactly what
makes it true.
You should know
more than anyone.
Why is that?
Because you're in this book.
Oh, kid.
You've got problems.
Yep, and you're gonna
fix 'em.
<i>(whoosh, bells tinkle)</i>
(man) when we reach the cell,
stay <i>out</i> of the light,
And whatever you do,
do <i>not</i> let him know your name.
If he knows your name,
he will have power over you.
Rumplestiltskin.
Rumplestiltskin!
I have a question for you.
No, you don't.
<i>They</i> do...
Snow white and...
(mocking voice) prince charming.
(laughs)
You insult me.
Step into the light and take off
those ridiculous robes.
Ah. (cackles)
That's much better.
We've come to ask you
about the...
Yes, yes!
I know why you're here.
You want to know about
the queen's threat.
Tell us what you know!
Ohh. Tense, aren't we?
Fear not, for I can ease
your mind,
But it's gonna cost you
something in return.
No. This is a waste of time.
What do you want?
Oh...
The name
of your unborn child?
Absolutely not.
Deal. What do you know?
Ah. (chuckles)
The queen has created
a powerful curse,
And it's coming.
Soon you'll all be
in a prison,
Just like me, only worse,
For your prison,
<i>all</i> of our prisons
Will be time,
For time will stop,
And we will be trapped
someplace horrible,
Where everything
we hold dear,
Everything we love will be
ripped from us,
While we suffer
for all eternity,
While the queen celebrates,
Victorious at last!
No more happy endings.
What can we do?
We can't do anything.
Who can?
That little thing
growing inside your belly.
(blade whooshes, thud)
(inhales deeply)
Next time I cut it off.
(clicks tongue)
The infant is our only hope.
Get the child to safety.
Get the child to safety,
And on its... 28th birthday,
The child will return.
The child will find you,
And the final battle
will begin!
(laughs)
I've heard enough.
We're leaving.
(laughs)
oh, ho! Ooh! Yoo-hoo!
Hey! You! We made a deal!
I want her name!
We had a deal!
I need her name!
H-h-her name!
"her"? It's a boy.
Missy. Missy,
you know I'm right.
Tell me. What's her name?
Emma.
Her name is Emma.
Emma.
Ah.
(thunder rumbles)
(Emma) okay, kid.
How about an address?
(Henry)
44 I'm-not-telling-you street.
(brakes squeal)
(electricity crackles)
(sighs)
(car door opens)
Look, it's been
a long night,
And it's almost...
8:15?
That clock hasn't moved
in my whole life.
Time's frozen here.
Excuse me?
The evil queen did it
with her curse.
She sent everyone
from the enchanted forest here.
Hang on.
An evil queen sent a bunch
of fairy tale characters here?
Yeah,
and now they're trapped.
Frozen in time
And stuck
in Storybrooke, maine...
That's what you're
going with?
It's true.
Then why doesn't everybody
just leave?
They can't. If they try,
bad things happen.
(man) Henry.
What are you doing here?
Is everything all right?
I'm fine, archie.
(whimpers)
Who is this?
Just someone trying
to give him a ride home.
Oh, she's my mom, archie.
Oh. I see.
Do you know where he lives?
Uh, yeah, sure. Just, uh,
right up on mifflin street.
The mayor's house is
the biggest one on the block.
You're the mayor's kid?
Uh, maybe.
Hey, where were you today,
Henry?
'cause you missed
our session.
Oh, well, I forgot to tell you,
I went on a field trip.
Henry...
What did I tell you
about lying?
Giving in to one's dark side
never accomplishes anything.
Okay.
Well, I really should be
getting him home.
Yeah, sure.
Well, listen,
um, have a good night,
And, uh, you be good, Henry.
(chuckles) yeah.
(thunder rumbles)
So that's your shrink?
(whistling)
I'm not crazy.
Didn't say that.
Just... He doesn't seem
cursed to me.
Maybe he's just trying
to help you.
(speaks indistinctly)
He's the one who needs help,
because he doesn't know.
That he's
a fairy tale character?
None of them do.
They don't remember
who they are.
(sighs) convenient.
All right. I'll play.
Who's he supposed to be?
Jiminy Cricket.
Right. The lying thing.
I thought your nose grew
a little bit.
I'm not pinocchio.
Of course you're not,
'cause that would be ridiculous.
(engine rumbles)
I say, we fight!
Fighting is a bad idea.
Giving in to one's dark side
never accomplishes anything.
And how many wars has
a clear conscience won?
(rattle)
We need to take
the queen out
Before she can inflict
her curse.
Can we even trust
rumplestiltskin?
I've sent my men
into the forest.
The animals are abuzz
with the queen's plan.
This is going to happen,
unless we do something.
There's no point.
The future is written.
No. I refuse
to believe that.
Good can't just lose.
Maybe it can.
No. No. Not as long
as we have each other.
If you believe him
about the curse,
Then you must believe him
about our child.
She <i>will</i> be the savior.
(door bangs open)
What the hell is this?
(bells tinkle)
Our only hope of saving
that child.
A tree?
Our fate rests on a tree?
Let's get back
to the fighting thing.
The tree is enchanted.
If fashioned into a vessel,
it can ward off any curse.
Geppetto, can you build
such a thing?
Me and my boy...
we can do it.
This will work.
We all must have faith.
There is, however, a catch.
The enchantment is
indeed powerful,
But all power has its limits,
And this tree can protect
only one.
Please don't take me
back there.
(latch clicks)
I have to. I'm sure your parents
are worried sick about you.
I don't have parents...
just a mom, and she's evil.
Evil? That's a bit extreme,
isn't it?
She is. She doesn't love me.
She only pretends to.
Kid. (sighs)
I'm sure that's not true.
Henry?
(voice breaks) oh, Henry.
Ohh. Are you okay?
Where have you been?!
What happened?
I found my <i>real</i> mom!
Y-you're
Henry’s birth mother?
Hi. (sig)
(british accent) I'll just go
and check on the lad,
Make sure he's all right.
How would you like a glass
Of the best apple cider
you ever tasted?
Got anything stronger?
(door squeaks)
How did he find me?
No idea.
When I adopted him,
he was only 3 weeks old.
The records were sealed.
I was told
the birth mother didn't want
To have any contact.
(liquid pouring)
you were told right.
And the father?
There was one.
Do I need to be worried
about him?
Nope. He doesn't even know.
(ice cubes clinking)
Do I need to be worried
about you, Ms. Swan?
Absolutely not.
Madame mayor, you can relax.
Other than being
a tired little boy,
Henry's fine.
Thank you, sheriff.
I'm sorry he dragged you
out of your life.
I really don't know
what's gotten into him.
Kid's having a rough time.
It happens.
You have to understand,
ever since I became mayor,
Balancing things
has been tricky.
You have a job, I assume?
Uh, I keep busy, yeah.
Imagine having another one
on top of it.
That's being a single mom,
so I push for order.
(chuckles) am I strict?
I suppose, but I do it
for his own good.
I want Henry to excel
in life.
I don't think that
makes me evil, do you?
I'm sure
he's just saying that
Because of
the fairy tale thing.
What fairy tale thing?
Oh, you know, his book,
How he thinks everyone's
a cartoon character from it,
Like his shrink is
Jiminy Cricket. (chuckles)
I'm sorry. I really have no idea
what you're talking about.
You know what? (sighs)
it's none of my business.
He's your kid,
And I really should be
heading back.
Of course.
(jangles keys)
(engine rumbling)
Sneaky bastard.
(gasps)
(brakes squeal
and tires screech)
(crash)
(thunder crashes)
(howling)
(rattles)
♪
I don't want to do this.
It has to be you.
I'm not leaving you.
It's the only way.
You'll go in there,
And you'll be safe
from the curse.
He said it would be
on her 28th birthday.
What's 28 years,
when you have eternal love?
(crying)
I got faith.
You will save me,
as I did you.
(sniffles)
(flames crackling)
What is it?
(gasps) the baby.
(strained voice)
she's coming.
(whooshing in distance,
birds crying)
(sighs)
(snoring)
wake up.
Wake up!
Look!
(cries, thunder crashing)
The curse! It's here!
(rings)
(man whistling
"whistle while you work")
What are you looking at,
sister?
(italian accent) hey, leroy.
Manners. We have a guest.
So you are,
uh, Henry’s mother?
How lovely for him to have
you back in his life.
Actually I was just
dropping him off.
(scoffs) don't blame ya.
They're all brats.
Who needs 'em?
Well, I'd give anything
for one.
My wife and I...
we tried for many years,
But, uh...
It was not meant to be.
Well, cry me a river.
Leroy, I'm going to let you out.
You need to behave.
(jangles keys)
(lock clicks)
Put on a smile,
and stay out of trouble.
(whistles)
Seriously?
Regina's drinks...
A little stronger
than we thought.
I wasn't drunk.
There was a wolf standing
in the middle of the road.
A wolf. Right.
(regina) graham, Henry’s run
away again. We have to...
What is <i>she</i> doing here?
Do you know where he is?
Lady, I haven't seen him since
I dropped him at your house,
And I have
a pretty good alibi.
Yeah, well, he wasn't
in his room this morning.
Did you try his friends?
He doesn't really have any.
He's kind of a loner.
Every kid has friends.
Did you check his computer?
If he's close to someone,
he'd be e-mailing them.
And you know this how?
Finding people is what I do.
Here's an idea.
How about you guys let me out,
and I'll help you find him?
(beeps, mouse clicks)
Smart kid.
He cleared his in-box.
(sighs) I'm smart, too.
A little hard disk recovery
utility I like to use.
I'm a bit more old-fashioned
in my techniques...
Pounding the pavement,
knocking on doors,
That sort of thing.
(clicking keyboard keys)
(sighs) you're on salary.
(beeps)
I get paid for delivery.
Pounding the pavement is not
a luxury that I get.
(beep)
Huh. There's a receipt
for a web site...
WhosYourMomma.Org.
(beep)
it's expensive.
He has a credit card?
He's 10.
Well, he used one.
Let's pull up
a transaction record.
(click, beep)
"mary margaret blanchard."
Who's
mary margaret blanchard?
Henry's teacher.
As we build our birdhouses,
remember,
What you're making is a home,
not a cage.
The bird is free and will do
what it will.
This is for them, not us.
They're loyal creatures.
Ohh.
(boy gasps) wow.
If you love them
and they love you,
They will always find you.
(school bell rings)
We'll pick this up after recess.
No running.
(indistinct conversations)
Why, thank you.
Ms. Mills,
what are you doing here?
Where's my son?
Henry? I assumed he was
home sick with you.
You think I'd be here
if he was?
Did you give him your
credit card so he can find her?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm his... I'm his...
The woman who gave him up
for adoption.
(sighs)
You don't know anything
about this, do you?
No, unfortunately not.
Clever boy.
I should never have
given him that book.
What in the hell is this book
I keep hearing about?
Just some old stories
I gave him.
As you well know,
Henry is a special boy...
So smart, so creative,
And as you might be aware...
Lonely.
He needed it.
What he needs is
a dose of reality.
This is a waste of time.
(books thud)
Have a nice trip
back to boston.
Sorry to bother you.
No, it's...
It's okay. I fear this is
partially my fault.
How's a book
supposed to help?
What do you think
stories are for?
These stories...
The classics?
There's a reason
we all know them.
They're a way for us
to deal with our world,
A world that doesn't
always make sense.
See, Henry hasn't had
the eaesiest life.
Yeah,
she's kind of a hard-ass.
No, it's more than her.
He's like any adopted child.
He wrestles with
that most basic question
They all inevitably face...
"why would anyone
give me away?"
I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
in any way to judge you.
It's okay.
Look, I gave the book to him
because I wanted Henry
To have the most important thing
anyone <i>can</i> have...
Hope.
Believing in
even the possibility
Of a happy ending is
a very powerful thing.
You know where he is,
don't you?
You might want to check
his castle.
(snow white screaming)
Aah! Aah! No.
No. I can't...
Have this baby now.
Doc, please help me.
It's gonna be okay.
(exhaling deeply)
The wardrobe's almost finished.
Just... just hold on.
(screaming)
(grunting)
(screaming)
It's ready.
(moaning)
It's too late.
We can't move her.
Push.
(snow white) aah!
(baby crying)
(thunderclap)
(crying)
The wardrobe.
It only takes one.
(men screaming, swords clashing)
(rumbling)
Then our plan has failed.
At least we're together.
(men continue screaming)
No. You have to take her.
Take the baby
to the wardrobe.
Are you out of your mind?
No. It's the only way.
You have to send her. No.
No, no, no, no. You don't know
what you're saying.
No, I do. We have to believe
that she'll come back for us.
We have to give her
her best chance.
Good-bye, Emma.
(blade whooshes)
(Emma crying)
(sobbing)
Uhh! (grunts)
(squish)
(blade whooshes)
(grunting)
(clank)
Aah!
(grunts)
Uhh!
(panting)
Find us.
(man grunts)
(grunts)
(clanking)
Uhh!
(whoosh)
(sword clanks)
(man grunting)
You left this in my car.
Still hasn't moved, huh?
I was hoping that
when I brought you back,
Things would change here,
That the final battle
would begin.
I'm not fighting
any battles, kid.
Yes, you are. You're here
because it's your destiny.
You're gonna bring back
the happy endings.
Can you cut it
with the book crap?
You don't have to be hostile.
I know you like me. I can tell.
You're just pushing me away
because I make you feel guilty.
It's okay.
I know why
you gave me away.
You wanted to give me
my best chance.
How do you know that?
It's the same reason
snow white gave <i>you</i> away.
Listen to me, kid.
I am not in any book.
I'm a real person.
And I'm no savior.
You were right about
one thing, though.
(seagulls crying)
I wanted you to have
your best chance.
But it's not with me.
Come on. Let's go.
Please don't take me back there.
Just stay with me for one week.
That's all I ask.
One week,
and you'll see I'm not crazy.
I have to get you
back to your mom.
You don't know what it's like
with her. My life sucks.
Oh, you want to know
what sucking is?
Being left abandoned
on the side of a freeway.
My parents didn't even bother
to drop me off at a hospital.
I ended up
in the foster system
And I had a family
until I was 3,
But then they had their own kid,
so they sent me back.
(sighs)
Look...
Your mom is trying her best.
I know it's hard,
And I know sometimes you think
she doesn't love you,
But at least she wants you.
Your parents didn't leave you
on the side of the freeway.
That's just
where you came through.
What?
The wardrobe. When you went
through the wardrobe,
You appeared in the street.
Your parents were trying
to save you from the curse.
Sure they were.
(chuckles)
Come on, Henry.
(snow white moans)
No.
No.
No!
No!
No. No.
(whispers) no. No. No. No.
Please.
Please come back to me.
What?
(footsteps approach)
Oh, don't worry, dear.
In a few moments,
you won't remember you knew him,
Let alone loved him.
Why did you do this?
Because this is
<i>my</i> happy ending.
The child?
(man) gone.
It was in the wardrobe,
and then it was gone.
It's nowhere to be found.
Where is she?
She got away.
You're going to lose.
I know that now.
Good will always win.
We'll see about that.
(laughing evilly)
(wind howling)
Where are we going?
Somewhere horrible.
(glass shatters)
Absolutely horrible.
A place where the only
happy ending will be mine.
(thunderclap)
(birds chirping)
Thank you.
No problem.
He seemed to have taken
quite a shine to you.
(chuckles)
You know what's kinda crazy?
Yesterday was my birthday,
And when I blew out the candle
on this cupcake I bought myself,
I actually made a wish
That I didn't have to be alone
on my birthday.
And then Henry showed up.
I hope there's no mi.
I'm sorry?
Don't mistake all this
As an invitation
back into his life.
Oh.
Ms. Swan, you made a decision
ten years ago.
And in the last decade,
while you've been...
Well, who knows
what you've been doing?
I've changed every diaper,
Soothed every fever,
Endured every tantrum.
You may have given birth to him,
but he is <i>my</i> son.
I was not...
No, you don't get to speak.
You don't get to do anything.
You gave up that right when
you toss him away.
Do you know what
a closed adoption is?
It's what you asked for.
You have no legal right
to Henry,
And you're gonna be held
to that.
So I suggest you get in your car
and you leave this town,
Because if you don't,
I <i>will</i> destroy you if it is
the last thing I do.
Good-bye, Ms. Swan.
Do you love him?
Excuse me?
Henry.
Do you love him?
Of course I love him.
(door closes)
(wind whistling)
(door creaks)
(woman) you're out all night,
and now you're going out again.
(woman) I should've moved
to boston!
I'm sorry that my heart attack
interfered with your plans
To sleep your way down
the eastern seaboard.
Excuse me?
I'd like a room.
Really?
Would you like a forest view
or a square view?
Normally, there's an upgrade fee
for the square,
But as rent is due,
I'll waive it.
Square is fine.
Now... What's the name?
Swan. Emma Swan.
Emma.
What a lovely name.
Thanks.
(drawer opens and closes)
It's all here.
Yes, yes, of course.
Yes, dear, thank you.
You enjoy your stay...
Emma.
(door creaks)
(door closes)
Who's that?
Mr. Gold. He owns this place.
The inn?
No. The town.
So how long
will you be with us?
A week.
Just a week.
Great.
Welcome to Storybrooke.
