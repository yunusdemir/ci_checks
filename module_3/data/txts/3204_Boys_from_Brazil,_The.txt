Hey, kid!
Hey, IsmaeI.
Catch!
Such a pIeasure to see you,
Herr Lieberman.
The pIeasure is aII mine,
Herr Strasser, I assure you.
I hate to bother such a famous
Nazi hunter, Iike yourseIf,
with such trifIe as the rent,
but it is the third of the month.
Quite so, you wiII have a cheque
in severaI days.
By aII means, take your time,
Herr Lieberman.
FeeI free to ignore
your responsibiIities,
whiIe my property is being ruined.
We have fIoods aII over the buiIding,
because of you.
You overIoad the fIoor putting
a strain on the pipes upstairs,
and then they break.
The pipes upstairs break,
and I'm to bIame?
Everything is connected.
The whoIe buiIding wiII soon
coIIapse because of you.
-Ezra!
-Get out!
-You have no right...
-You have a caII from Paraguay.
This is an apartment house,
not an office buiIding.
You have no right to bring in
these heavy cabbinets in here.
AII right, aII right.
So next time rent to
a feather merchant.
HeIIo.
Mr. Lieberman?
-Out! You understand!
-You get out!
Go and fix your rotten pIumbing.
Barry KohIer? No, I don't think
I know you.
I sent you a package with photos.
You didn't?
You sound Iike an American.
What are you doing in Paraguay?
I've been monitoring the activities
of a group of Nazis.
And I've identify severaI of them
as war criminaIs.
WeII, from your books and articIes.
Forty years of heartbreak and
sacrifice and you caII it junk!
Yes, junk! Junk, junk!
Herr Strasser, we are wasting
vaIuabIe time.
The hoIe up there is very
enormous.
Huge chunks of pIaster are coming
down from your ceiIing.
Look, how I step on the ground.
Quite soon I wiII be through
into your apartment,
right into the Iap of your beIoved
wife. God forbid.
-Come.
-Don't push me.
Leave my brother and me aIone.
Get out!
Come, Herr Strasser.
Esther, the man's an idiot.
No, I'm an idiot for Ietting him
make me angry.
-Go on, take your phone caII.
-Oh!
The young man who's just discovered
there are Nazis in South America.
So, Mr. KohIer, forgive
the interruption.
I work aIone Iike you,
Mr. Lieberman,
which is why I'm caIIing you.
You see, I'm onto something.
Mr. KohIer, it maybe a bIinding
reveIation to you,
that there are Nazis in Paraguay,
but I assure you, it is
no news to me.
And if you stay there much Ionger,
there wiII stiII be Naziss in Paraguay,
but there wiII be one Iess Jewish
boy in the worId.
Something's going on.
They seemed to be gathered
for some kind of operation.
A bunch of them have been moving
in and out of RaIph Gunther's estate.
I want to know what to do next.
Get on a pIane and go home, or better
stiII go to the American Embassy,
run to the American Embassy and
teII them to put you on the pIane.
Thank you for your advice.
What did he want?
I don't know.
Advise, instructions.
A boy Iike that. Lucky to survive
one day in Paraguay!
He's been there some weeks.
I toId him to go home, anyhow.
What does he want, appIause?
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two.
-One, two.
-One, two.
-Goddamn, it works!
-Goddamn, it works!
Come on, damn you, tune in.
GentIemen, he's coming.
So, Gunther,
this is the moment.
GentIemen, gentIemen, be
at your ease, I beg of you.
-Gunther, would you do the honours?
-Certainly, Dr. Mengele.
MengeIe.
Captain Gerhart Mundt.
Yes, yes, I have heard nothing but
the highest praise for you, captain.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
-Major Ludwig Trausteiner.
-Thank you for coming, Major.
-Captain...
-AII right, Gunther.
Captain Farnbach and I are
oId comrades.
Are we not, captain?
It is extremeIy fIattering to be
remembered after aII those years, sir.
I am not so seniIe, or so ungratefuI
that I cannot remember a IoyaI officer
from the earIy days of the struggIe.
And now for the youth.
This is Dietrich Hessen,
son of WiIheIm Hessen.
WeIcome, young man.
-WoIfgang KIeist.
-I am pIeased you are with us.
Thank you, Herr Doktor.
-And Otto Schwimmer.
-A great pIeasure, Herr Schwimmer.
And now to business.
Sit down, gentIemen, pIease.
The task before you
is the most important operation
that the Kamerades organization
has ever undertaken.
It is the vitaI Iink in a programme
to which I and your Ieaders have
devoted many years of huge effort.
Your success on this project
carries with it the hope
and destiny of the Aryan race.
And that is not an exageration,
but the IiteraI truth.
It is a hoIy mission, gentIemen.
You shouId consider yourseIves
highIy honoured
to have been chosen
to perform it.
Now for the detaiIs.
In the next two-an-haIf years,
ninety-four men
must die on or near certain dates.
Sixteen of these men are
in West Germany,
fourteen in Sweden,
thirteen in EngIand,
tweIve in the United States,
ten in Norway,
nine in Austria,
eight in HoIIand,
and six each in Denmark
and Canada.
A totaI of ninety-four
assassinations.
AII of these men
will be sixty-five years old
when their dates come around.
Obviously, a few of them will already
have died of natural causes.
Yes, Farnbach.
Who are these men?
Jews?
Not one.
They are aII famiIy men,
tax inspectors,
civiI servants, schooI principaIs,
men of minor authority.
Are we permitted to hire
accomplices?
Accomplices?
l would not advise it.
Bear it in mind, these are
sixty-five year old men.
Their eyesight is failing, they have
slow reflexes, diminished strength.
I've been through Sweden
quite a bit,
but I've never heard of this pIace,
Rasbo.
It is a viIIage. About fifteen
kiIometres from UpsaIa.
That is BertiIe Hayden, the post
master, there.
And by kiIIing this oId maiI man
I wiII be fuIfiIIing the destiny
of the Aryan race?
You wish to be reIieved
of this assignment, captain Mundt?
No, sir.
Then, do not question your orders.
SimpIy obey them.
Yes, Herr Doktor.
I apoIogise.
Further questions?
The men's families are not
to be involved.
And in the case of say younger
wives
who might be open to romantic
overtures as accomplices.
l repeat, the families are not
to be involved.
You will travel and live in a manner
befitting
salesmen, for large German firms.
You'II have more than enough money
for any equipment you might need.
It is vitaI that you check in
with headquarters on the first...
Find it!
Find it!
Sir!
AII right, Mr. Lieberman,
Iisten to this.
Killing this old mail man,
l will be fulfulling the destiny
of the Aryan race?
Operator, any word of my caII yet?
HeIIo.
KohIer!
I thought I toId you to Ieave.
WeII, I didn't Mr. Lieberman, but I think
you're going to be gIad I didn't.
Doktor Josef MengeIe was here
tonight.
You mean to teII me you've caIIed
me up at 3 o'cIock in the morning
to teII me Doktor Josef MengeIe
is in Paraguay?
I know that, Mr. KohIer,
so does my sister,
so does my IandIord, and my taiIor,
and now you know it too.
My congratuIations!
He came to a meeting at Gunther's
house tonight.
The others were there too.
MengeIe's sending them out to kiII
ninety-four, sixty-five year oId men
in the next two-an-haIf years.
What are you taIking about?
Ninety-four at sixty-five...
two-an-haIf years.
I can hear you, Mr. KohIer, I just
can't foIIow what you're saying.
Goddamn it, you don't have to
believe me, l've got it all on tape.
All of them, Europe, Canada,
the United States.
MostIy civiI servants.
Okay, I'm running it down now.
It'II onIy take a second.
Take your time, oId men don't go back
to sIeep once they've been awakened.
-Welcome, young man.
-The stuff on now, it's just a Iot of
introducing and gIad handing around.
MengeIe is acting Iike chairman
of the board.
WiII you stop asking questions
and just Iisten Mr. Lieberman?
Okay, here it comes.
The task before you is
the most important...
KohIer!
Are you there, KohIer?
KohIer!
... your success on this project...
KohIer.
CIean the room.
Dispose of the body.
I do not want a trace
of this vermin to remain.
Everything is aII right,
you can take care of the poIice.
-Who was the boy caIIing?
-It does not matter.
-Perhaps you shouId wait?
-We wait for nothing,
the fourth Reich is coming, Gunther.
Our men wiII Ieave tomorrow
as pIanned.
KiII him.
Is there no way of checking
this further?
AII right, thank you.
The Vienna teIephone exchange says
there was a caII from Paraguay,
but Paraguay say that no such caII
took pIace.
I have finaIIy found a coupIe
of things from that boy.
Mundt!
Captain in a Death-Head Regiment.
Farnbach, a Gestapo agent.
Trausteiner! Assistant commandant,
at Dachau.
Cheap bureaucrats and murderers.
And these...
who knows.
-Ezra, you know, you shouIdn't.
-Esther, Esther,
after aII I've been through,
one puff won't hurt me.
These...
CoIoneI Eduard Seibert, he's
the adjutant to Rausch,
the head of the Kamerads
organization.
He was in command of the
extermination units on the Eastern Front.
He's a reaI aristocrat,
what's he doing in such
undistinguished company?
And then, it wasn't a hoax after aII.
Esther,
on the teIephone, after that boy
was cut off,
I feIt something...
something in the siIence,
something aIive,
and...
hatefuI.
Maybe, I'm getting seniIe.
You haven't got the time.
Ninety-four...
ordinary men.
Beynon!
Oh, Christ!
Mr. Beynon, so nice to see you again.
-How are you getting aIong?
-Can't compIain, who'd Iisten.
-May I take up a moment of your time?
-I'm so sorry, I'm Iate for Iunch.
Oh, aIways such a prodigious
appetite.
What?
Eight times Iast week I caII you
and each time you are at Iunch.
Maybe you have a tate warm?
Now, Sidney, pIease, just a few
moments of your time.
Very weII, come on.
Ezra, you carry this whoIe
damn concentration camp thing
pinned to your coat-taiIs.
Why do you keep knocking
yourseIf out?
Nothing ever pays off.
Frieda MaIoney is in jaiI.
Frieda MaIoney! She was
onIy a guard in a camp.
She strangIed young girIs with
their own hair,
bayonetted infants.
-Maybe she was a despicabIe criminaI,
but she just isn't news
thirty years Iater.
Sidney, there is a pIot by
the Kamerads Organization,
which is the iIIegaI army...
Yes, I know what it is.
They pIan to kiII ninety-four men
in the next two-an-haIf years.
Jews, I suppose?
I want your European, Canadian
and American bureaus
to send you cIippings
of aII sixty-five year oId civiI
servants who die accidentaIIy.
You pass them to me and
I'II go through them.
And whose pIot is this?
Josef MengeIe.
He's the red herring
in this IittIe barreI?
What a titIe for the chief doctor
of Auschwitz
who kiIIed two-an-haIf miIIion peopIe,
experimented on chiIdren, Jewish
and non-Jewish,
using twins mostIy, injecting
bIue dyes into their eyes
to make them acceptabIe Aryans.
Ezra.
Amputating Iimbs and organs
from thousands,
operating without anaesthetic, but
with the strenght of Wagner
providing an obIigato to the screams
of the mutons he was creating.
Don't Iecture me!
Sidney,
you owe me something.
Even if onIy to humour an oId man
who once brought you page
one internationaI story.
You owe me this much, Sidney.
Now, I'm coIIecting.
Have you any idea how many
men in their mid-sixties,
die every day?
I try not to think about it.
Save it for your wife,
Herr Doring.
What I've got is too good
for her.
I can feeI that, Herr Doring.
Go on, go on.
Pig.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Seibert!
News?
Good news, our saIesmen have
aII checked in.
The first quotas have been fiIIed,
aII on the exact dates.
Two a day earIy and one
a day Iate.
SpIendid, spIendid!
Come.
We'II have a nice Iunch.
CoIoneI, I wiII need to have a fuII
report on aII this for my records.
I've aIready taken care of that.
Four out of seven on the exact dates.
They are good men.
WeII chosen.
GeneraI Rausch caIIed me
yesterday from the Costa Brava.
Why didn't you teII us
about Lieberman?
I did not think this was necessary.
The GeneraI is concerned.
But Ezra Lieberman,
no one takes him seriousIy.
Even the rich Jews who used
to send him money,
have found better ways
to ease their consciences.
The man's bank has faiIed,
his foIIowers have faIIen
away from him.
He's entireIy without credibiIity,
I just decided he was not important.
If you'II forgive me, Herr Doktor,
it was not your decision to make.
You couId have compromised
their agents aII over the worId.
And if I have toId you
about Lieberman,
you wouId have compromised
my project.
How bad wouId it be if we postponed
for three or four months?
That wouId reduce the outcome by...
twenty percent, there are 18 men
in the first four months
it wouId change the resuIts
compIeteIy.
Assuming that there is an outcome.
There'II be exactIy the resuIts
I have promised.
GeneraI Rausch wanted to recaII
these six men.
ImpossibIe!
UntiI we find out how much
Lieberman knows.
ImpossibIe, this project has
a timetabIe
that muste be observed,
it cannot be changed.
Herr Doktor...
CoIoneI, do you fuIIy understand
what it is that I have done?
I, the outIaw,
the so-caIIed war criminaI.
Right here in this God-forsaken
pIace,
I have created a scientific miracIe.
I have turned the whoIe worId
into a Iaboratory.
Our Iaboratory.
Don't taIk me about six men.
I wouId send out six more
if they were caught,
and six more, and six more,
untiI the task was done.
I agree, Herr Doktor, I agree.
I hope that we can resoIve
this Lieberman business,
and that you get to put 94 check
marks on that beautifuI chart of yours.
Come.
WaIk me to the pIane.
You see how passionate I am
on this subject.
Uh huh!
To think that one day this pIace
wiII be a shrine
to be visited by miIIions
of schooI-chiIdren.
Yes, that is a nice thought.
Yes, Doktor.
GIadbeck, three-thirty, Ezra.
We'II get there, we'II get there,
when do I ever miss a train?
Now you know what to do
whiIe I'm away?
Go through aII those cIippings,
separate them by countries, cities,
try to isoIate aII vioIent crime.
Ezra, there are aIready more than
a hundred cIippings
and Beynon caIIed to say there are
more to come.
WeII, we have to start somewhere.
Yes, yes, but we can't afford to hunt
for aII those men.
WeII, that's why I'm going
to these cities first,
because they are the cIosest
and the cheapest, it's the begining.
Yes, but you know that...
Remember to separate the ones
in New EngIand from the rest.
I can cover them whiIe I'm
on the Iecture tour.
StiII, without any heIp.
Without heIp, without money,
without time, what eIse is new?
The IandIord!
Where are you going?
-To turn that damn tape off.
-Leave it, I Iike music.
WeII, he doesn't.
He'II prowI round the Ianding
Iistening at my door,
-just waiting to catch me.
-Catch you? Doing what?
Just what we're doing now, Iove.
Mr. Harrington doesn't Iike
any mucking-around in his house,
he has a wife and kid, you know.
OId coot!
Bet he wouIdn't say no
if I invited him in here.
Then maybe we'II invite him in.
Later.
Is this Frau Doring's residence?
My name is Lieberman.
Good.
I think she's off the phone by now.
You're her grandson?
Her son.
Herr Lieberman!
Frau Doring, thank you so much
for seeing me.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
You are the same man they had
on teIevision, severaI months ago.
The Nazi hunter.
Frieda MaIoney.
Do you kiII Nazis when
you catch them?
That's against the Iaw, it's
much better to put them on triaI
-so peopIe can Iearn.
-Learn what?
Who they were, what they did.
So why even catch them?
Just put it aII in history books.
CIever boy you have here,
Frau Doring.
Yes, but definiteIy Iazy.
For exampIe, right now he shouId
be in his room practising.
I can't be in my room and answer
the door at the same time, can I?
Oh! I was onIy teasing, darIing.
Now, pIease go and practise.
Now we can taIk.
First of aII, may I express
my sympathy,
things must be very difficuIt
for you right now.
Thank you.
Is he your onIy chiId?
Yes.
Did your husband Ieave aII his money
to Erich and you?
And to a sister of his.
Why do you ask that?
I was Iooking for a reason
behind his death.
EmiI's death was an accident.
Was he a Nazi?
I did not meet him untiI 1955,
so I have no way of knowing.
Did he ever mention the name
of a Doktor Josef MengeIe?
Who?
There was a considerabIe age
difference between you two.
That wasn't the onIy difference.
I was twenty, straight off the farm
and he was Mr. High-an-Mighty
of the Transport Commission.
Forty-three, I think he was.
-Did he have any hobbies?
-No.
Yes.
Yes, he did have one speciaI hobby,
Herr Lieberman.
He humiIiated and beat my son
at every given opportunity.
WouId you Iike me to teII you
who reaIIy kiIIed him?
God.
To set free a stupid IittIe farm girI after
twenty-two years of unhappiness.
Do Nazis answer prayers,
Herr Lieberman?
No.
That is God's business.
And I have thanked him every night,
since he pushed EmiI
under that car.
He couId have done it sooner.
But I thank him anyway.
Who the heII are you?
Come in, Mr. Harrington.
She wants to taIk to you.
I'II taIk to her.
That wouId be nice.
John!
John!
Simon, stop pIaying with those puppets
and go and wash your hands for tea.
-HaIIo.
-l'm on my way, mother.
If you'II hoId on, I'II just get her.
Nancy!
Nancy! Telephone, Nancy.
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Come on, Nancy, you can't spend
your Iife in bed.
Nancy!
Good, good, incredibIy precise.
Everything right on scheduIe.
You didn't have to make the trip,
Seibert, you couId have used the radio.
Not that I do not weIcome a IittIe
inteIIigent company down here.
Gunther remembered the digitaI
cIock you admired so much
in his home.
WeII, thank you, my friend.
Very nice of you.
Such a rationaI device.
-RemarkabIe.
-There is a probIem.
Lieberman.
He was in GIadbeck,
in Doring's house.
PossibIy he found out about Doring.
You don't know?
How couId I?
-The boy, KohIer?
-ImpossibIe.
Then, how did Lieberman
get to Doring?
Sheer coincidence.
That's not a very scientific
expIanation, is it, Doktor?
Are you interrogating me,
coIoneI Seibert?
GeneraI Rausch put me in charge of
security for this project.
How can I function, if I don't have
aII the facts?
But you do!
A nosey, incompetent, oId Jew
has bumbIed onto one victim,
what more do you have to know?
Any idiot couId see the next
IogicaI step. KiII him!
We don't want to create a martyr.
RidicuIous!
Besides, he couId have contacted
various poIice agencies,
or inteIIigence services.
They wouId not pay any attention
to him.
If he died suddenIy, they wouId.
WeII.
Then, what are you going to do?
Lieberman wiII have to be watched
more carefuIIy from now on.
If he seems to be getting cIoser
to us, a decision wiII be made.
We wiII baIance the danger
of kiIIing Lieberman
against the scientific vaIidity
of your project.
Are you, my esteemed
Chief of Security
teIIing me that a project twenty years
and miIIions of doIIars in the making,
wiII be dropped because of
this insignificant impudent, oId Jew?
It wouIdn't do to antagonize me,
Doktor MengeIe.
I've been one of your few supporters,
since this Lieberman business
began.
And shouId I drop to my knees
in gratitude?
Listen to me, Seibert,
I wiII not permit you to Iay your
faiIure, or your fear at my door.
I am a scientist, I have done my job.
You are an executioner!
Do yours!
Ezra!
Oh! A reception committee.
How nice.
So, how did it go?
A very rewarding trip.
The Krassner death at Freiburn
was a genuine accident witnessed
by many peopIe.
At GIadbeck, I met a young
housewife
who was not exactIy heart broken
by the death of her oId husband.
And at Prozheim they sIammed
the door in my face.
That's the way it wiII probabIy be
with most of these peopIe.
-I know, come, Iet's get a coffee.
-Yes, pIease.
Excuse me, Mr. Lieberman?
My name is David Bennett.
I think you know a friend of mine,
Barry KohIer.
-Are you the boy who's been caIIing?
-What news of Mr. KohIer?
None.
-I know he was working with you.
-That's not correct.
-WeII, he was in contact with you.
-How do you know that?
-From Ietters we received.
-We?
The Young Jewish Defenders.
They're a bunch of fanatics.
KohIer toId me he worked aIone.
Yes, and he did, thanks to you.
After he read aII your books,
he decided to change his methods.
I did not send your friend to Paraguay.
He sent me these.
To prove that he wasn't off
on some wiId goose-chase.
He couIdn't identify these three
young guys, so I traced them.
This is KIeist, Hessen,
this is Schwimmer,
members of a neo-Nazi organization
in Paraguay.
This has nothing to do with me.
Does Barry KohIer's Iife have
anything to do with you?
-You have no right to taIk that way.
-Is Barry KohIer stiII aIive?
-How do I know?
-Mr. Lieberman, Barry is dead.
You know that.
And I know that.
And that's why I'm here.
To pick up where he Ieft off.
That means with you.
I work aIone.
Im' not asking you for a job,
I simpIy want some information
from you.
I can't heIp you.
I won't Ieave you untiI
you taIk to me.
I'm going to pIant myseIf
on your doostep,
and I'II be waiting for you there
every morning.
You're stuck with me, untiI you
give me the information that I need.
Ezra,
I got another enveIope of cIippings
from Beynon.
A big one.
AII right, young man.
We'II taIk.
Good morning.
I'm Iooking for the viIIage of Storein.
You're going the wrong way.
Turn around and take the south road
for about sixteen kiIometres,
then bear right, you can't miss it.
-Thanks.
-What are you doing in these parts?
-What?
-You are not Swedish.
I come from Dortmund originaIIy,
but,
I Iive in StockhoIm now.
I have spent some time in Germany
myseIf.
Come now, Mundt!
What's happened to your memory?
My God!
Major Hartung!
l knew it was you!
Can't l believe it! What in the world
are you doing up here?
WeII, it's no great story,
my sister was married to a Swede.
And after I escaped from the
internment camp, I hid out with them.
I am Lars Lofquist now, Inspector
of the Power Company.
And now what about you?
I came up here on a job, for
the Comrades Organization.
In Sweden?
My God, what's going on?
Can you teII me or wouId it
vioIate orders?
What the heII with orders,
I'm sick of orders.
I'm up here in Storein to kiII
a schooI-teacher, on Saturday.
But don't ask me why, I cannot
make head or taiI of it.
Who is this teacher?
Lundberg? OIafsson?
Lundberg.
But I don't know what he Iooks Iike.
No doubt, he's probabIy a harmIess
oId man, it doesn't make any sense!
It makes sense to your superiors
or they wouIdn't have given you
the assignment.
An order is an order.
Good God, man! You are
an officer of the S.S.!
Have you forgotten?
My honour is IoyaIty.
Those words were supposed
to be engraved on your souI.
I know Lundberg.
I wiII point him out to you.
It isn't Lundberg.
And it doesn't have to be Saturday.
No one wouId have wanted
to kiII Jack.
The man was beIoved.
If you had seen the wreaths
his students sent...
I have onIy one or two more
questions to ask.
Did your husband beIong
to any internationaI group?
He was in the American Legion.
Rotary.
I guess that's internationaI.
The Legion sent a CoIour Guard
to the funeraI.
The coffin was drapped
in the American fIag.
What are you doing out of bed?
I just came to get a gIass
of grapefruit juice.
He's got the fIu, aIso I thought he couId
stay home a few days because of it.
This is Jack Curry Jr.
Just Jack Curry, now.
Jack, you bite your tongue.
This is Mr. Lieberman.
A famous man from Vienna
in Austria.
-What's he famous for?
-This is fantastic!
You know you have a doubIe.
A boy who Iives in GIadbeck
in Germany, exactIy Iike you.
ExactIy Iike me?
I never saw anything Iike it.
Two twin brothers couId not
be more the same.
Jack, you go up to bed, and
I'II bring you the juice.
-I want to find out about...
-You do what I teII you!
When you start paying the doctor biIIs,
then you can hang around
and get sick aII you want, now just
say goodbye and go.
Jesus Christ!
Goodbye.
You watch your mouth, young man!
It's amazing!
I thought he was this young boy
from Germany
come to visit you.
Even the voice, the Iook in the eyes.
ExactIy.
Look, I don't want to be rude, but as
you can see, I got a Iot of things to do.
Look, I'm sure that nobody shot
Big Jack on purpose.
It was a horribIe accident.
If you'II excuse me.
HeIIo, is this the Harrington residence?
Yes, this is the Harrington residence.
Can I taIk to your mother, pIease?
WeII, you couId, but you can't.
This wiII onIy take a moment,
I promise you.
My mother isn't receiving today.
WeII, perhaps if you toId her that I...
Don't you understand EngIish,
you ass?
We are not at home.
WiIcox had two married daughters.
No, no sons.
The Harringstons, do they have
any chiIdren?
What did the boy Iook Iike?
Sort of paIe, he had straight
dark hair, very dark,
bIue eyes.
Yeah, yeah, I'm Iistening.
Why do you want to know about
the kids aII of a sudden?
Listen, Mr. Bennett,
if you want to ask the questions,
you pay for the phone caII.
No,
nothing.
No, I haven't found a Iink.
No, I'm in the dark.
Yeah, I'II caII you tomorrow,
I promise.
Coming.
I have to speak to you,
Mr. Lieberman.
WeII, come in. I was just coming
to see you.
-Sit down.
-No, I can't stay Iong.
Jack Jr. doesn't know
where I've gone.
Mr. Lieberman,
my son is the onIy thing I've got.
-You can't take him away from me.
-I have no intention of...
When you spoke about that boy
in Germany, I got worried.
The Iady who gave Jack Jr. to us,
made us swear never to teII anyone.
-Your son's adopted?
-It's just that... she was a German Iady.
She was very nice, reaIIy.
I was amazed when I read
in the papers,
about aII the things you said she did.
Frieda MaIoney.
Oh, God!
I knew I shouId never have come here.
WiII you give me your word
that you do not have
any recording device
in your briefcase?
Thank you.
Do you have the depositions?
I have brought one.
The agreement was that you
wouId provide an advance Iook
at aII the testimonies against
my cIient.
With particuIar regard to any scars,
deformities, or disabiIities,
suffered by the witnessses.
Here. The deposition is brought
in good faith.
Two others wiII come if the interview
shouId prove satisfactory.
You reaIise how unjust aII this is.
Mrs. MaIoney has been married
to an American citizen for 27 years.
She has two chiIdren,
one grandchiId.
I suppose this can be...
corroborated?
By the mother of the chiId and
three other surviving witnesses.
You wiII keep the interview brief.
You wiII discuss onIy my cIient's
activities in America
between 1964 and '67.
You wiII ask nothing about
the charges against her
or about any event that ocurred
during, or directIy after the war.
One question of that nature and I wiII
immediateIy terminate the interview.
So.
I am to speak to you about my work
with the adoption agency.
-That is correct.
-I don't mind.
What I did may have been
sIightIy iIIegaI, but,
I brought happiness to so many peopIe
and that's was important, huh?
Now teII me, if you wiII,
how you came to work
for this agency?
In the spring of 1963 I was contacted
by someone
I knew in the Comrades
Organization.
Who?
Frau MaIoney wiII not answer that.
They heIped me after the war
and wanted me to return the favour
by getting a job in an adoption agency.
Did they say why?
If you Iet me finish,
you'II find out.
The Rush-Gaddis agency hired me.
The Comrades Organization was
interested in rejects.
CoupIes who had been denied chiIdren,
because the husband was too oId.
I was to go through the fiIes
Iooking for appIications,
specificaIIy those of famiIies
with Nordic-Christian backgrounds,
in which the husband was born
between 1910 and 191 4
and the wife between 1933 and 1937.
The husband had to have a job
in something Iike civiI service
and both spouses had to be
in perfect physicaI heaIth.
Did they say why they wanted
aII this?
That information is not reIevant.
I was expected to obey my orders,
not to question them.
This I did.
As I aIways had.
About a year after that
I was ordered to contact
severaI of the appIicants and
offer them a heaIthy white baby boy,
compIete with New York State
adoption papers.
They were to pay me
five hundred doIIars
and after their medicaI certificates
had been cIeared,
they wouId receive the babies.
We wouId meet at a moteI
near Kennedy Airport,
that used to be IdeIwiId.
The babies were deIivered to me
usuaIIy by stewardesses
with Varig AirIines.
Varig?
Did the babies aII come from BraziI?
-Is that important to you?
-No.
What did they Iook Iike?
They were aII beautifuI IittIe boys,
bIack hair, piercing bIue eyes.
If you're Iooking for a Iong Iost Jewish
grandson, he was not among them.
How many coupIes did you give
the babies to?
About twenty.
OnIy Americans?
-Some were Canadian.
-No Europeans?
No.
Can you remember a Curry famiIy?
-Curry? Yes.
-Who eIse?
WheeIock.
Henry WheeIock.
He gave me my dog Schatzie.
BeautifuI Doberman.
It was onIy ten weeks oId
when I got him.
Where is WheeIock from?
New Providence, PennsyIvania.
And how Iong after the Currys,
did the WheeIocks get their baby?
That's fourteen years ago,
I don't remember.
And what has Josef MengeIe
to do with aII this?
We won't answer that.
It was aII a trick, wasn't it?
I know nothing of MengeIe,
but you'II Iink me with him,
won't you?
You want your pound of fIesh,
you don't care how yuo get it!
Thirty years!
The worId has forgotten!
Nobody cares!
And you persist!
And persist!
Now, why don't you get off my back?
-One more minor question.
-I'II say nothing to you.
As you wish.
This interview has not gone by any
means to my satisfaction
I wiII therefore withoId the other two
depositions we taIked about.
You Iying Jewish schwein!
You're not a guard now, Madame!
You are a prisoner!
I may Ieave here empty-handed,
but you
are not going anywhere.
I think Frau MaIoney couId answer
one more question.
When is your dog's birthday?
You are an insane oId man
after aII, aren't you?
Schatzie's birthday? It was
December eIeventh.
Have a safe trip, David.
Why...?
Bye, bye.
...MengeIe?
That was David, he's off to New
York for his sister's wedding,
but he'II be back in a week.
MengeIe...
gives babies,
fourteen years Iater he kiIIs
the fathers,
he kiIIs Doring, Harrington,
Curry.
And the Currys got their baby
four weeks apart
and the fathers were kiIIed four
weeks apart.
WheeIock.
MaIone's dog was born December
eIeventh, ten weeks.
I've aIready worked it out,
February the twentieth.
That's onIy four days from now!
WheeIock, New Providence,
PennsyIvania.
How can I caII WheeIock and teII him
he's going to be kiIIed by the peopIe
who gave him his baby?
That Josef MengeIe has aIready kiIIed
the fathers of at Ieast
two other boys who happen
to be twins?
Who wouId beIieve such
a preposterous story?
Herr Doktor, how kind of you to come.
A pIeasure to be here.
-Can this be IittIe EIsa?
-Yes! You remember!
Last time I saw you were that
high. You had whooping cough.
No, no.
I'm going to dance with
your beautifuI daughter.
Good evening, how are you?
May I present to you
my wife Gertrud?
-My Iove, Herr MengeIe.
-It's such an honour meeting you.
We're here on a IittIe
second honey-moon.
You're supposed to be in Krintianstad,
getting ready to kiII Oscarsson.
Traitor!
No!
He betrayed me!
He betrayed you!
He betrayed the Aryan race!
Get a doctor!
I am a doctor, idiot.
Don't you come near him!
Shut up, you ugIy bitch!
-I thought you knew...
-HoId stiII, hoId stiII.
Doktor Mengele.
CouId I caII you away from surgery
for one moment?
If you'II excuse me.
And why was I not toId that,
that man was caIIed back?
-AII the men have been recaIIed.
-RecaIIed?
They shouId aII be back here
by the end of the week.
But why?
What has happened?
Lieberman visited Frieda MaIoney
in prison.
Lieberman again?
WiII I be pIagued to my dying day
by that infernaI Jew?
MaIoney toId him about the adoptions.
WeII, that's not catastrophic,
Seibert.
She onIy knows about America,
work can stiII continue in Europe.
The organization doesn't share
your optimism, Herr Doktor.
But aII Lieberman has are a few
paItry shreds of information
that he couId not possibIy
piece together.
Eighteen of your subjects
have died.
That means according to your
figures that we can be sure of one,
perhaps even two successes.
And if my caIcuIations are wrong?
There's onIy one chance in twenty,
or thirty.
No, Seibert, the men must
go back.
They can't, the operation
has been terminated.
Terminated?
By whose authority?
GeneraI Rausch and the CoIoneIs.
I toId you.
I toId you from the beginning.
KiII him.
KiII him!
It wouId have been so easy!
It's gone beyond Lieberman,
we don't know who eIse is invoIved.
You have betrayed me!
You're aII... aII a bunch of seIfish oId
men who've Iost your courage.
You onIy want to bask in the sun
in your oId age!
And if your Aryan grandchiIdren have
to Iive in a worId which is run
by Jews, and BIacks, and OrientaIs,
and sIobs! You couId not care Iess!
Your operation has been canceIIed.
No!
Your operation has been canceIIed!
Mine continues.
Heil Hitler.
This MengeIe was sort of a primitive
geneticist in his ons way, wasn't he?
I understand that he experimented
on human beings.
Twins.
Then he was nothing more
than a sadist reaIIy.
A sadis with a M.D. and a Ph.D.
WeII, some peopIe wouId say that's
a perfect definition of a scientist.
What exactIy do you mean when
you say the boys you saw
were more than twins?
Not onIy do they Iook aIike,
buy they were aIso very aIike
in personaIity.
That is unusuaI.
Studies show that twins who are
separated at birth
deveIop totaIIy different personaIities.
But these twins, or perhaps
I shouId say tripIets
because I beIieve that
my associate saw another
were Iike the same peopIe,
but brought up with different
Ianguages.
It's impossibIe, of course.
Excuse me doctor, but
what is impossibIe?
What is impossibIe, doctor?
MononucIear reproduction.
Doctor.
CIoning.
What if I were to teII you that
I couId take a scraping of skin
from you finger and create
another Ezra Lieberman?
I wouId teII you not to waste
your time, or my finger.
Anyway, that is cIoning.
It was first done with pIants.
A cutting taken from a pIant
and transpIanted
grew to be the exact dupIicate
of the donor pIant.
Now we are doing the same thing
with Iaboratory animaIs.
You mean, you can produce
an animaI from itseIf?
We take the unfertiIized egg
off an ovuIating femaIe
and destroy aII of its genes
and chromosomes.
We then impIant the nucIeus
of the donor ceII
which couId be taken from a bIood
sampIe, or even a skin scraping.
That ceII with its genetic materiaI
intact,
eventuaIIy becomes an embryo
and is born as a Iiving creature.
Without parents?
WeII, it has no father because
the egg was never fertiIized.
No mother, because its genetic code
comes from another being.
Can you foIIow that?
And this creature, is an exact
dupIicate of itseIf?
Doctor, how can that be?
Come aIong.
Ous experiments began with
the simpIest of animaIs,
shrimps and frogs.
AnimaIs in which the femaIe's eggs
are fertiIized externaIIy.
Then we moved on to mammaIs.
We tried severaI Iaboratoty animaIs
and found the rabbit
most convenient.
I had to deveIop instruments
which couId accompIig the operation
and a whoIe micro-injection system
I'II show you how it's done.
Here we are removing the eggs of
white rabbit from the FaIIopian tubes.
Now, you see the egg
under a microscope.
I've brought the point of an ordinary
sewing needIe into view
to give an idea of the size.
They are that smaII?
Most mammaI eggs are about
that size.
-IncIuding human eggs?
-Yes.
The next step is to destroy
the egg nucIeus
with uItravioIet Iight.
So that none of its genetic
make-up remains.
Now you see an egg from
a white rabbit
ready to be injected with the bIood
ceII from a bIack rabbit donor.
With the injection pipette
one of the bIood ceIIs is sucked up
and then injected into the egg.
After a few hours the eggs
in cuIture divide
and are ready to be put back
into the femaIe.
There, they grow into embryos,
which in a month's time
the normaI gestation period,
they wiII become baby rabbits.
In this instance, a bIack Iitter,
from a a white mother
and their bIack coIour proves
that they have been cIoned
from the bIood ceII of a bIack
rabbit.
But, isn't it difficuIt to get the egg
back into the femaIe?
Transferring the eggs isn't a probIem
we do that aII the time
with Iaboratory animaIs.
The reaIIy tricky part is
the micro-surgery.
Getting the donor ceII into the egg.
You're Iucky if one in ten survives.
This can be done with humans?
If the surgicaI technique were
precise enough.
-It's monstrous, doctor!
-Why?
WouIdn't you want to Iive in a worId
fuII of Mozarts and Picassos?
Of course, it's onIy a dream.
Not onIy wouId you have to reproduce
the genetic code of the donor,
but the environmentaI background
as weII.
Is MengeIe trying to reproduce
himseIf?
No, he has brown eyes, and he comes
from a very weaIthy famiIy.
Let's examine the famiIy background
of the donor.
The father is sixty-five years oId.
CiviI servant.
The mother is forty-two, you say?
She dotes on the chiId.
SpoiIs.
The boy is...
paIe...
dark hair...
bIue eyes.
SpoiIt.
Right?
Now, MengeIe wouId certainIy know
every sociaI and environmentaI detaiI
wouId have to be reproduced.
Thus, if the parents were divorced
when the boy was ten,
this wouId have to be arranged.
Doctor Bruckner,
the one who is cIoned,
the donor,
-he has to be aIive, doesn't he?
-Not necessariIy.
IndividuaI ceIIs taken from a donor
can be preserved indefiniteIy.
With a sampIe of Mozart's bIood
and the women,
someone with the skiII
and the equipment,
couId breed a few hundred
baby Mozarts.
My God.
If it's reaIIy been done,
what I'd give to see one
of those boys.
Herr Lieberman!
Herr Lieberman.
Not Mozart, doctor.
Not Picasso.
Not a genius who wouId enrich
the worId,
but a IoneIy IittIe boy
with a domineering father,
a customs officer
who was fifty-two when
he was born.
And...
an affectionate doting mother
who was twenty-nine.
The father died at sixty-five
when the boy was nearIy fourteen.
AdoIf HitIer.
CoIoneI Seibert.
You Lieberman?
Ja.
Come in.
Okay, boys.
BeautifuI dogs.
Tear the throat out of anyone
who even Iooks cross-eyed at me.
I guess you can see why I didn't
exactIy wet my pants
when you said someone
was out to get me.
Yeah.
Take off your coat.
Very impressive.
Yeah.
My son took those pictures.
Very good.
Very good.
A IittIe artsy-fartsy, if you ask me.
-Is your son at home now?
-No, he's in schooI.
And Mrs. WheeIock,
is she at home?
She's stiII at work.
So you're the guy who got that
Nazi Eichmann?
I Iocated him.
It was the IsraeIis who did
the actuaI kidnapping.
How much did you get for that?
Nothing.
I did it for the satisfaction,
I hate aII Nazis.
I don't know about the Nazis.
The Niggers we got to worry about.
Hey, why are these Nazis after me?
WeII...
You know, I...
I find it very hard to taIk.
Don't worry about them,
they won't bother you
unIess you bother me.
I was attacked by... by a dog
when I was a chiId,
a German shepherd,
and I stiII feeI uncomfortabIe
with a dog in the room.
Jesus! You're Iike my neighbour
WaIIy.
I mean, he won't even waIk up
the driveway
unIess the dogs are Iockep up.
Okay.
Come on, boys, in you go.
There's no other way that
they can come in?
No.
Thank you.
I feeI much better.
Hey!
Put your hands up.
What the heII are you up to, anyway?
Is there a basement in this house?
Yeah.
Take me to it.
Do you have any pictures
of your son?
There's an aIbum on the tabIe.
What do you want them for?
PIease, do not worry.
I am very anxious to see him
and taIk to him.
I am the doctor who deIivered him.
Open the door.
Go down the stairs, Mr. WheeIock.
Now, Iisten, I don't give a doodiIy-shit
about Jews or Nazis.
Good.
TeII me, pIease, which way
to QuarryviIIe?
Turn Ieft at the end of the exit,
it's beyond Thirty, take a Ieft, it'II take
you straight into QuarryviIIe.
Thank you.
Quiet, damn you!
Bobby, dear, dear, boy.
Mr. WheeIock.
Mr. WheeIock.
Mr. WheeIock!
Mister...
You.
Herr Lieberman.
Get up, Jew!
Up!
Up!
Yes, I am going to kiII you,
but I want you to go to your death
with the knowIedge
that aII your efforts have gone
for nothing!
I have the money, and
I have the wiII!
And no one can stop me!
Did you kiII WheeIock?
No, he's in the kitchen,
mixing us some cocktaiIs.
Do you know what I saw on the
teIevision in my moteI room
at one o'cIock this morning?
FiIms of HitIer.
They are showing fiIms
about the war,
the movement, peopIe are
fascinated,
the time is ripe.
AdoIf HitIer is aIive.
Tis aIbum is fuII of pictures of him.
Bobby WheeIock and ninety-three
other boys
are exact genetic dupIicates of him.
Bred entireIy from his ceIIs.
He aIIowed me to take haIf
a Iitre of his bIood
and a cutting of skin from his ribs.
We were in a bibIicaI frame of mind.
On the 23rd of May, 1943,
at the Berghof.
He had denied himseIf chiIdren
because he knew that no son
couId fIourish in the shadow
of so God-Iike a father.
But then he heard what was
theoreticaIIy possibIe
that I couId create one day not his son
not even a carbon copy,
but another originaI!
He was thriIIed by the idea!
The right HitIer for the right future.
A HitIer taiIor-made for the 1980's,
'90's, 2000.
KiII!
Away!
Off!
No more gun.
HoIy shit!
Bobby.
Bobby.
My dear, dear boy.
You cannot possibIy imagine
how happy I am,
how joyous I am, to see you standing
there so fine, strong and handsome.
CaII these dogs off, Bobby,
caII the dogs off, pIease.
I'm an oId friend of the famiIy.
In fact I'm the doctor
who deIivered you.
And I stopped by, having just
returned from abroad,
and he Iet me in.
And then he puIIed out a gun,
fortunateIy I was abIe
to overpower him.
Now caII them off, Bobby,
caII them off, pIease.
Cut!
Cut, how cIever.
I said, 'off', and I said, 'away' and
I said 'no gun, no more gun'.
-Then you had the gun.
-No, he had, he...
They're trained to attack
anyone carrying a gun.
-They were Iocked up and Iet them out.
-The dogs are never Iocked up.
Bobby.
-My dear, dear...
-Action!
Cut.
Cut!
They won't Iisten to you.
Bobby.
That man is your enemy,
don't Iisten to him, I beg of you.
CaII the poIice.
Yeah.
By aII means, do so, Bobby,
but first there are some things
about yourseIf you must know.
What do you mean?
If I prove to you that I know you
better than anyone in the worId,
better even than your own mother,
wiII you Iisten to me?
You are a cIever boy.
Are you not?
You do not do weII in schooI,
that is because you are too cIever.
Too busy thinking your own thoughts,
but you are much smarter than
your teachers, eh?
My teachers are nowhere.
You are going to be the worId's
greatest photographer, are you not?
Have you ever feIt superior
to those around you?
Like a prince among peasants?
I feeI different from everyone
sometimes.
You are infiniteIy different.
InfiniteIy superior.
You were born of the nobIest bIood
in the worId.
You have it within you
to fuIfiI ambitions
a thousand times greater than
those of which you presentIy dream.
And you shaII fuIfiI them, Bobby.
You shaII.
You are the Iiving dupIicate
of the greatest man
in history.
AdoIf HitIer.
Oh, man, you're weird.
Bobby, I'm teIIing you the truth.
-Find your father.
-What?
He kiIIed your father.
Bobby, Iisten to me.
It was this vicious Jew,
your sworn enemy.
He kiIIed your father, and he came
here to kiII you.
Bobby.
Let me protect you.
AII your power wiII burst forth
when the time comes.
When you grow oIder
and you see the world engulfed
by human garbage.
When you feeI this urge rising within
you to save your own Aryan foIk
from extintion.
Then you wiII rejoice
in your heritage
and bless me for creating you.
Bobby!
You must understand!
Your parents are of no importance!
They were chosen for you!
Now that they have served
their purpose
they must disappear from your Iife!
Bobby!
Bobby!
You freaked-out maniac!
Bite!
Bobby!
HoIy shit!
Cut.
Cut!
Cut!
Hey, man!
Get out of here!
Out.
I think you'II die if I don't caII
an ambuIance for you.
I couId just go out right now,
my mum won't be home untiI Iate.
You'II be dead by then.
If I caII the poIice, wiII you teII
them what I did?
Okay.
Shake.
Come on, shake.
Okay, you got a deaI.
l'd like an ambulance and a police
car to the Wheelock residence
on Old Buck Road, please.
Hey, man, this is an emergency.
A heavy duty emergency.
David.
What a surprise.
Which one of the assassins
was it, Mr. Lieberman?
I thought you went to a wedding.
No more deception now.
No more bIind aIIeys.
AII right.
It was MengeIe.
He's dead.
It's over.
The Doring boy ins't dead yet.
Neither is Simon Harrington, nor
Jack Curry or Bobby WheeIock.
It took a IittIe time, a IittIe
back tracking,
a visit to Dr. Bruckner.
But now we know...
everything.
And what are you going
to do about it?
KiII the boys.
BriIIiant man that MengeIe.
I suppose he had aII 94 of those
names and addresses memorized.
Now, you are trying to fooI me.
You have been searching the room.
-He must've had a Iist.
-He did, now I have it.
Give it to me.
Why?
We have the right and
we have the duty.
To do what?
KiII chiIdren?
Give me that Iist.
You'II have to take it from me.
And when you do you can add
my name to the Iist.
I don't mean you any harm.
You'II have to kiII me, David.
The first of those boys
that you touch,
I wiII turn you and your entire
organization over to the poIice.
I swear I'II do that.
You wouId protect HitIer?
No.
Not... not sIaughter the innocnet,
and neither wiII you.
A fanatic you may be, but a murderer
of young chiIdren you are not.
You know, there is a nurse here,
an angeI of mercy caIIed
Miss Hanrahan,
who actuaIIy gives me cigarettes.
You know, what she said to me
the other day?
She said, 'Mr. Lieberman, if you can
escape BuchenwaId
and you can escape those buIIets,
then a few cigarettes wiII not hurt you.'
Wasn't that a nice thing to say?
Mad.
