Well, your luck ain't all bad,

He's an organic chemist

Well, he left me.
We're divorced.
Oh. I'm sorry.

Wait a moment.
Excuse me.
We need the kid right away.
What crime is he supposed to have seen?
He hasn't said anything to me about it.
Inspector, the kid ain't here.
Miss Devereaux...

Excuse me, Inspector.
I thinkwe're all
a little confused.
Oh, boy.

Warrant? Ofcourse.
Let me see.
We have a warrant!
What areyou doing to my mom?
- Shit.

That's not bad for a blind man.
But that butter knife

Mrs. Devereaux?

Devereaux.
Hi, Frank.
I brought some ofyour stuff.
Oh, look, a whole box.
Does your boss know?
I do the inventory.
How'd you get into
my apartment, Annie?
They let me in.
Did they tell you
what theywant me to do?
Did they tell you...
what they've already done?
No, and I don't want to know.
Now listen to me, Frank.
When people owe Claude MacCready,
they pay...
one way or the other.
Sojust go along.
It's the best way.
You tell MacCready
I'll talk to him?
- It's coming down, huh?
- Yeah!
Come on,
I'll buyyou some coffee.
Hey, it's still raining.
A little water
never hurt anyone.
Yeah? Well, ifI catch pneumonia,
it'll be all your fault.
I'll try and live
with the guilt.
A little water
never hurt anyone!
Don'tyou laugh.
Well, I can see
where I'm going.
It's not funny.
I hurt my knee.
It hurts.
I can't move.
That's all right.
Wait until the paramedics come.
Hey, wait up!
Don't be mad.
They gave me a piece ofcandy
in the store. Want some?
I knew there was a nice little boy
inside ofyou somewhere.
Soyou're a thieftoo, huh?
It fell out ofyour pocket.
Bull.

Operator, I'd like to place a collect

Her name is Lynn Devereaux.
Yeah, D-E-V-E-R--
Hey, what's the big idea?
- I need to call my mom.
- You can't.
Why not?
Why can't I?
Billy, there's something
you gotta know.
What's that supposed to mean?
You lied to me!
You told me she was at home!
Shut up!
Help!
No! Stop!
Shoot.
Popcorn!
Snow!
What the hell's goin' on
around here?
Nick!
Come here.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's all right.
There they all go,
headed for Harrod's.
Glitter and flash.
Shit.
Doyou rememberwhen the Silver State
was the place?
Sweet times.
Where did we go wrong?
Bank didn't giveyou
the extension, huh?
IfI don't come up with the green
to retire those loans in two days...
they're gonna retire us.
- Ed, I'm not keen on that idea.
- Slag's on it, but this blind--
I don't wanna hear
about this blind man!
What areyou doin', takin the stuff
we're supposed to be sellin'?
- No. I just--
- Shut up, Ed.
Ifyou can't handle it,
get me somebody that can.
Get me Bruce Lee.
Bruce Lee is dead.
Then get his brother.
Do it, Ed.
Goddamn it,just do it.
Nice head.
Room for some brains
in there.
I like that nose.
I don't.
It's always plugged up.
Firm chin.
All the makings
ofa strong man.
Tears.
Good.
'Cause a strong man
is never afraid to cry.
Did you ever cry?
I wish I could.
The place that makes tears
inside my head...
doesn't work anymore.
I wish mine didn't.
We'll be atyour father's
tomorrow.
He doesn't want me.
Come on.
With talent like this?
Any man would love
to have a son likeyou.
You think so?
Yeah.
- Did you see that?
- We should get one ofthose, honey.
Been a pleasure driving y'all.
Take care now.
Been a pleasure driving y'all.
Take care now.
Come on.
He doesn't want me.
And I don't want him.
Billy, whatever happened before
was in the past.
You got to learn how to forgive.
Now come on.
Steps.
One, two.
Hi there, Billy.
Who areyou?
My name's Annie.
I'm a friend ofyour daddy's.
Y'all come on in.
Nick, look out--
Bang.
Kinda hard for a blind man to look out,
ain't it, Brother Lyle?
Sure is, BrotherTector.
Lights out.
Hold still, you little shit.
Getyour hands offofhim!
Claude promised me
there wasn't gonna be anyviolence.
Shut up, bitch.
MacCready told us to get thejob done
and that's what we're gonna do.
Now hold still!
I love it! Slag takes days,
can't even cut the mustard.
- We nail the brat and the bat--
- In two minutes flat.
Want some, girl?
Look at the road, man!
Too much linguine.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Swell.
Beforeyou do that...
I wantyou to get us out ofhere.
- Me?
- Yeah.
How? I can't.
Just do as I tell you.
I can't.
Well, then...
we're gonna die.
Give me a hit ofthat.
Want some?
What doyou want me to do?
Crouch down like a frog.
Come on.
Putyour hands on the floor.
Slideyour butt...
through your arms.
Come on.
I just can't do that.
Yes, you can.
Try.
Try.
How's it going?
Pretty good.
Almost there.
Got one leg through.
I did it!
Great.
Get my lighter.
In my shirt.
- Got it.
- Light it.
Hold it steady.
Look at this.
Whoa!
The blind Zorro.
Stupid thing's
got a curse on it!
Start counting out loud.
One, two...
Don't stop until the van does.
Hey, baby...

I said lick mywound.
Yeah, baby! More!
Hey, Lyle,
something's burning, man.
-AndI thinkit's love
- No, man! Something's burning!
Aw, hell.
Stop the van.
Come on!
Oh, man, my head.
Who's gonna drive?
- Let's go, boys.
- We gotta go back.
Turn it around.
Hold on!
- How far did you count?
- Thirty-one.
Count backwards.
Thirty, twenty-nine,
twenty-eight--
Stop! Help us!
Help us, please!
Four, three, two, one.
- Stop.
- What? Why?
Stop right here.
My cane must be out here
somewhere.
Oh, ofcourse.
Those two want us for lunch...
but what's really important here
is thatyou find your damn cane.
Yes. Let's go.
Thank God you stopped.
We fell offa poultry truck.
We gotta get my brother to a hospital.
I think he's a goner.
Get out.
I said get out!
Come on, you battle-ax!
Moveyour ass!
Bitch.
Kill 'em!
Jesus H. Christ!
Yeah, that's one reason
I always vote for gun control.
I got it! I got it!
Thanks, Billy.
- Well, hallelujah.
- Good work.
Uh-oh.
Run!
My glasses!
I think I just found them.
I can't drive
without my glasses!
Lucky for me I'm blind.
Billy, navigate.
Nice going, Tector!
Let's go!
Don't start!
I've had a bad day!
Keep goin' straight.
Goin' straight.
Go to the right a little bit.
Go left.
Too much, too much.
Keep going straight.
Just stay right there.
You're going into the left lane!
Look out!
What's your problem,jack-off?
You blind?
Yeah.
What's your excuse?
Holy shit!
Red light!
Slow down!
- Tell me when we hit an intersection.
- Now! Turn right!
No, I mean left!
I see 'em!
Turn in there!
I know what I'm doin'!
This is easy.
Just like riding a bike.
Onceyou learn,
you never forget.
Oh, shit!
Take that!
- Are we in a tunnel?
- There ain't no tunnels in Reno.
Stop!
Well, that was fun.
Yeah.
Maybe I should
get my license again.
The first thing we do is sirsasana.
This is thebasicposture
inyoga.
Don'tyou worry, Annie.
Y'all will be safe here.
Thanks, Colleen.
I know I can always
count on you.
Ain't no big thing, baby.
I used to bring Frank's drinks
to the roulette wheel.
That's how we met.
He'd be at that table
round the clock for days.
Then he wouldn't show up
forweeks.
Tryin' to be a good boy,
I guess.
Butyou'd think a guywith
Frank's brains would know better.
I guess we all
got ourweaknesses.
Yes.
Just get Frank out ofthere.
Don't worry about it.
Uncle Nick, don't go!
That's nice.
You're my nephew now, huh?
Don't leave me.
Everybody leaves me.
Hold down the fort.
Protect the women.
I'll be back.
Promise?
You gotta promise.
I'm gonna getyour dad.
Good-bye, Billy.
Come on.
Hey, man, I wantyou to meet
my new wife Mindy, her folks.
Reception's gonna start in ten minutes.
Why don'tyoujoin us.
I want the eight.

No more bets.

Another natural for the lady.
All right! A natural!
Good evening, Mr. MacCready.
Hi, Charlie.
After I've cleared that up, I'm off
to see our production at the ski lodge.
Bring up that stuff
when it's ready.
What about Devereaux?
Keep him working?
He won't play along much longer unless
we prove to him that we've got his kid.
Slag never fucked up before.
He'll turn up.
Besides, by midnight...
Devereaux will have made enough drugs
to do the deal.
This'll give me the cash I need
to get my ass offthe auction block.
And the time to find a chemist
with a better attitude.
Like they say, Mr. Cobb...
the desert's filled with people
that had bad attitudes.
Have them send me up some roast chicken
and chocolate pudding.
No one else to the penthouse.

And it was my fault.
I tried to--
I just couldn't--
My life changed...

Still, part ofme was missing.
I don't know.
Like there were two Nicks.
One before...
and one after that day.
I wanted to be...
whole.
To come home.
It's funny. I knew I had
to find you so I could say...
'' Hey, I forgiveyou.
Move on.''
But, you know,
it wasn'tjust foryou.
It was for me too.
Yeah!
Goddamn! That thing's got more holes

I didn't know Dad wore a rubber.
Damn!
Come on!
Move over!
Jesus.

He's in the man's suite.
Kill him!

Nice shootin', Tector.
Hey, now. Come on, Brother Lyle.
Frank, behind you!
Oh, shit!
Where is he?
Stop! Stop that firing!
Doyou see him?
I can't see a thing.
That's where I live.
Here, you sons ofbitches!
Youjust wait a minute.
We cut a deal.
Ifyou ever get that stuffaway
from the blind man, find another buyer.
You're fixin' to make
a grievous error, sonny boy.
Do it.
Fire in the hole.
Knock, knock.
Well, well, well!
Mr. Blind Man.
You're positively
an incredible human being.
You're a walking advertisement
for hiring the handicapped.
Why don'tyou drop that cane
beforeyou cutyourself.
Before I put this boy's brains
in that lady's lap!
Drop it!
Now we can do some business.
That's right.
Just put that over here
on the table.
Open it.
Mr. Parker, there's someone
I'd likeyou to meet.
Oh, nice guy, I hope.
Everybody's trying
to kill me lately.
- Nick, he's trying--
- Shh, Frank! Shut up!
Relax, boy.
I paid a lot ofmoney to see this.

Not bad for a blind man.

Unreasonable men
