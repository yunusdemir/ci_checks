Come on. Come on. Go.
No, no... No, no, no, no, no...
Yeee...
Good job.
Come on. Come on let's keep it moving.
Good game. Good game.
You guys, stay out of trouble. All right... Yes...
Okay, back to the game.
Okay, guys. See you on Sunday.
All right.
Good morning.
What can I do for you, my son?
I think the question is what can I do for you,
Father?
I don't' understand.
Are you okay?
I saw you playing basketball with the kids out there.
A lot of poverty around here.
Yes, a lot of poverty.
Would you like to confess?
Confession?
Well, it's been a long time since I have done that.
Not father, I think I'm way beyond redemption.
There is just you, me and God.
And I'm sworn to secrecy.
So, what have you got to lose?
Come, have a seat.
Join me.
Take you time.
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.
Go on. Tell me... What's in your heart.
You know, everything they write about
me in the newspaper is true.
I am an undercover agent for the CIA.
Go on my son.
I am... a killer.
We used to believe in... something.
But not any more.
You did a good job in New York, Marcus.
With Zawirahowi dead,
the Iranians will not be getting their shipment.
Are you okay?
Yes, sir.
And your team?
No Problems.
I swore to defend my country against all
enemies foreign and domestic, but
the world is becoming... complex, Marcus.
We're at war with an enemy who has no face.
Often, within our own walls.
The Redvale Corporation is a major
hedge fund based in Detroit.
They have invested over $10 Billion
in oil exploration in Africa.
Because they are unhappy with the
local government policies...
they have been financing an arms
dealer named Frank Smith.
An armed rebel. Smith is a... real son of a bitch.
Establish contact, work for him,
infiltrate his organization.
And, when the time is right,
I'm going to take Smith and Redvale out.
Done.
And Marcus,
the CIA can not be connected to this.
I fully understand.
In today's world who knows if your
actions will get you a medal or...
A trial.
This is for you.
Good luck.
Ronny, I don't give a shit.
We got $2 million in to this deal.
He's late, that's not my problem.
Well, you tell them, they don't make that payment,
I'm going to cut off his fucking balls!
You're my attorney, I'm paying you 800 bucks an hour.
You stop wasting my time.
You foreclose on this asshole.
Jane, what's happening?
The vault reports that the money from Mr.
Smith from the African transaction is ready.
Fucking Wall Street.
These assholes create the biggest financial
disaster the American economy has seen in 80 years.
Millions of people lose their homes, their jobs,
and nearly bankrupt the country.
And what happens?
They get rewarded with a government bail out.
All right, let's go.
Subject is leaving the airport.
Don't get too close.
Remember people,
we don't make a move before he picks up the money.
Marcus will give us the cue.
Is this the bakery?
Is the oven hot?
We're right on schedule.
To the minute?
To the second.
Everything is set, sir.
Punctuality is the politeness of kings.
Do you know who said that?
No, sir.
It was king Louis XVIII.
He was a slimy fucker.
Sycophantic little punk.
Sir, Mr. Smith and his team are on their way.
Everything is set.
Hey, would you do me a favor? Put on the air...
It's like a hot box in here.
It's already on, Sir.
Well then, turn it up.
This is Zander.
Dietrich is out of the picture.
I'm now in command.
Oh, Christ... Jesus.
What the...?
Is everything all right, back there?
Jesus... my, my chest.
Oh shit, he's having a heart attack.
Get us to the hospital.
What's going on down there?
Target is off course.
ETA?
- 5 minutes, but I think we have company.
Did you take anything?
Did you take anything? Boss?
Do not lose them.
Request permission to fire on target.
Keep Smith alive, at all costs.
We're losing him. He's heading toward the hospital.
Please stop. He's my client.
I'm the head of his security.
Sir. Sir. We'll handle this.
Sir, please. Let the doctors do their job, all right.
I can't go with him?
No, you can't.
The best thing you can do for
yourself is go to the desk over there
and tell the nurse all the information
about the patient, all right.
It will only take a couple minutes.
All right. Thank you.
Please, fill out this form.
Hi, I'm Dr. Brown. Can you tell me what happened?
Look, boss just had a heart attack.
I really need to stay with him. What's his name?
His name is Frank Smith.
Does he have a history of cardiac problems?
None that I'm aware of.
Sir, just stay here. Look, he's my client.
We're going to take care of him, all right.
Agent 1, cover the stairwell.
Agent 3, the emergency exit.
4 and 5, get the elevators.
I want the entire premises covered.
Guys, we got a situation out here.
We need to call 911, right away.
We're on. I know,
we just received a 911 call from the hospital.
We need to move up our plan.
This is dispatch. Cancel all response to the
911 call from the Detroit Medical Center.
This is a national security operation.
Undercover agents are on site. Do not interfere.
I repeat, do not interfere.
Sir, are you carrying a weapon?
Yes, look, I am a close protection specialist.
Sir. Please do me a favor.
Hand the weapon to the officer.
It's hospital policy.
We'll put it in safekeeping.
Ok.
Doctor, how's he doing?
He's stabilized, we're taking him up to the ICU,
right now.
Smith is in ICU.
Thank you. Are you okay? Yeah...
Look, no... Do you have some orange
juice or a candy bar or something?
I'm a diabetic. I'll get a nurse to help you.
Sit down and I'll get a nurse to get you tested.
We're going to take care of you, right away...
Just follow me, please.
Thank you.
What's going on with the hospital?
The hospital built a new wing. And, they're in the
process of transferring patients over, today.
Good timing on your part, huh?
Excuse me, sir?
But do not you're not supposed to be in here.
Mr Smith, has anything else like this
ever happened to you before?
No. We're running some tests on you, now.
You can get me the results on the enzyme analysis,
please?
All right, we're in.
Marcus is alone with the nurse.
So, what do you do for a living?
I protect very important people.
That's interesting.
Are you from Detroit?
No.
Is it dangerous?
Sometimes.
Well, this little needle won't hurt you, then.
I always wanted to date a bodyguard.
Thank you.
Look,
I'm real concerned about the man I came in with.
I think he had a heart attack...
Where would they take him?
I suppose, the ICU.
But, I don't think they've been moved yet.
It's on the fourth floor.
Can showed me where that is? Okay,
I'll take you there.
Did you get Marcus?
What's the status?
Marcus is in the stairwell on
the way to fourth pitro.
Copy that.
Kill him. Now!
I dreamed you...
I dreamed you and now you're real.
Please, take me out of here.
Wait...wait... wait.
Please take me.
Let me touch you?
Just... just once.
I'll be gentle, I promise.
I can show you the way out of here.
I never dated anyone, before...
Dr. Green?
Did you bring my pills?
You know, the red ones? The pink ones?
And, the blue ones. Dr. Green? He likes them all.
I can show you the way out of here!
Dr. Green, I need those pills.
It's up here.
Pushing man. Pushing man.
Pointing man.
Get over there against the wall, next to the door.
Can we play the door game now? Get, over there.
Where are the doctors?
They said they would come back.
Please take me with you.
Agent 3?
Agent 3, report.
Get down to the third floor and find
out what the fuck is going on.
You can't be in here. Please leave, now!
This patient is a threat to national security.
He's going to have to leave with us.
He's not going anywhere. He just had a heart attack.
We inserted a cardiac cathater and looks certain he
will need a stent inserted into his artery.
Can't allow him to travel.
Marie, please call security.
I wouldn't do that.
I'm afraid, you have no choice.
No say in the matter.
We're security now.
Mr. Smith, good morning.
We're going to go see your friends, now.
Mr. Smith, please calm down, calm down.
Look, I don't care what you do,
but you give him something to jack him up.
Make him strong.
You want me to pump up a man who just had
a heart attack full of epinephrine?
It'll kill him. I won't allow it.
You can and you will.
Like I said, you have no choice.
How long is this going to take?
What you're suggesting, will certainly
cause him to have another heart attack.
You're asking me to put the life of my
patient as risk. I won't do it.
I'm not suggesting anything, Doc.
You either give him a shot or you take one yourself.
Marcus?
Floria.
Is that you?
What's going on?
There's been a change of plans, Marcus.
Oh, yeah?
Where's Dietrich?
Dietrich is dead.
What happened?
Things are complicated,
can we just talk about it?
No...
no, no, no, no, you people are trying to kill me.
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.
Seems like you and me both have an interest in Mr.
Smith staying alive.
So, I'm going to perform the
procedure my patient needs to survive.
If after inserting the stent, he is not alert,
then I'll administer the shot you are requesting.
Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
Demerol.
If you give him the shot first,
he's not going to make it out of here alive.
Why don't you just tell me what's going on?
Huh.
Where's Zander?
Zander is in charge, Marcus.
In charge of what?
I was running this mission.
Like I said, things have changed.
How long is this going to take?
Not less than one hour.
You got 30 minutes.
So, why don't you tell me what's the new mission?
Huh?
The mission is we're taking the fucking money,
Marcus.
We're getting the fuck out of here.
You can either join us, or you can die.
Don't be stupid, Marcus. We know all your moves.
Well, I guess that puts us on opposite sides,
doesn't it.
Now, will you get that thing out of my
face so I can take care of my patient.
$100 million, Marcus. Come on.
You can have a nice life, Marcus.
We control this whole place.
You're outnumbered.
The cops aren't coming for you. You have no back up.
We're it!
I know this isn't about Smith.
That piece of shit going down,
was always part of the plan.
So, what is this?
The system is corrupt.
Every day we risk our lives and for what?
We protect sellouts and monsters, Marcus.
It's been like that a long time
and it's not going to change.
So, yeah, this time, fuck 'em.
We're taking the money.
Go find out what's happening.
And you make sure you keep this patient alive.
Marcus.
Yeah, roll with the punches, man,
you could still come out on top.
I'm gonna love my new life, Marcus.
I always liked you, Marcus.
Even thought, one day you might make a move on me.
Huh...
Talk to me.
I would love to talk to you, Marcus.
Well, man. I'm doing all the talking, kind of rude.
Haven't you got anything to say?
I got him.
Bring him to me alive.
Hello, Marcus.
Ok Mr. Smith, you start to feel better very soon.
Marcus.
My dear friend.
My teammate.
What did you think was going to happen, Frank?
You're trusted bodyguard was going to bust
through the door and save the day.
He's one of us.
Let me introduce you...
Agent Marcus Jones, CIA.
You are the mission, Frank.
Take down you and Redvale.
Look at him.
Perfect Boy Scout.
You made the wrong decision brother.
But you know what?
I knew you would.
You killed Dietrich.
Yeah. We killed Dietrich.
Your beloved mentor,
He was like a father to you, Marcus?
I knew he wouldn't go along with our plan,
so we eliminated him.
You know, when this is over...
I'm going to kill you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Right now, you ain't getting jack shit.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Zander...
It's time to go.
You've had enough time.
Get him in the wheelchair, now.
If I go too fast, it will kill him.
Hurry this up. We don't have time.
Get a bag of supplies ready for him to go.
Hurry the fuck up.
Please, put that away. I'm doing the best I can.
It's not going to make this any faster.
I'll take it down when you got him in a wheelchair.
You, wheelchair.
Come on, Frank. We're going to see your friends.
Right behind you.
Come on Frankie.
And, honey...
You're coming with us.
So, pack you're shit.
Take what you need and get out of here.
Smith and Redvale are responsible for
more than revolutions than Karl Marx.
They got more blood on their
hands than most dictators.
Still, they're protected by the law.
This is my life, Zander. All right.
And, I've spent is serving a country
that couldn't give a fuck about me.
So, yeah. I'm a little disillusioned.
Listen to me Flora.
I've been working on something.
Something,
that I think will be really good for you and me.
The betrayal of my team,
the betrayal of the people I trusted.
We were like a family.
Do you regret your life, my son?
Do you want God to forgive you?
No, Father.
I do not want to be forgiven for what I've done.
I stayed in the car all night.
And, then I realized... that
I have nothing left. My enemies have won.
And when I wake up this morning and I saw you
playing with the kids, I thought to myself...
Life could be so simple.
I just felt like...
Following you here. But...
I realized the world would be a much better place,
without men like me.
Look, I should go, Father.
I do not want to take up most of your time.
Tell me,
what happened to your team.
That is exactly what I'm saying. Are we clear?
All officers,
we have a homicide at the Detroit Medical Center.
The suspect is a former CIA agent,
involved in an assassination.
He is armed and dangerous.
What's so funny?
You're full of shit.
What did he say?
You're full of shit.
I'm not the one that's dying.
Yes you are.
Yes you are.
As soon as he steps into Redvale's building,
he's a dead man.
As soon as you step into Redvale's building,
you're a dead man.
No!... You want him to live, right?
All you're after is the money.
Redvale, is about power.
He's like the Mafioso in Sicily.
They control billions of dollars and live in shacks.
They, are about power.
It's about power.
Hey, What's he saying?
Nothing.
Just the ravings of a dying man.
They will never give you a dime.
Well, we'll see.
Hello, welcome to the Redvale Corporation.
How may I help you?
This is Mr. Frank Smith.
We're here to see to John Redvale.
Do you have and appointment? We're a bit late,
he's expecting us.
Let me call up to his office.
It will just take a moment, please.
Thank you.
Please see Mr Smith and his associates up to Mr.
Redvale's office.
Follow me, please.
Hello, Mr. Smith.
Are you okay?
Hi, Jane.
I'm Mr. Smith's bodyguard.
He's having a little heart trouble heart trouble,
right not and isn't feeling so well.
But we're here to keep the appointment with Mr.
Redvale.
Yes, of course.
Mr. Redvale is on a call at the moment,
but and has asked that you be
seated in the conference room.
It's right this way.
Mr. Smith is here to see you, but he doesn't look right.
And, he's got a lot of people with him, too.
Humm. Lets go take a look, shall we.
Hey!
Frankie!
How are you doing?
Ow, look at you.
What's going on?
Mr. Smith's not feeling well,
He's having a little heart trouble...
But, he wanted to come in to conclude
today's scheduled transaction.
Heart trouble, Frank?
You look like shit.
You should be at the hospital, Frank.
John...
Let's just finish... this deal.
Frank, uh...
Now is not a good time.
I wasn't expecting to do this here.
I figured, maybe we would go out,
have a little dinner, celebrate.
Mr. Smith would like to finish this
piece of business today. Now.
Isn't that right, Mr. Smith?
I'm sorry,
but who are you, again? Huh?
You work for Frank?
Because you're doing a lot of talking for him.
But, I ain't ever seen you before.
Where is your man Marcus, Frank?
He's been relieved of his duties. Oh, is that right?
Well, gentleman...
I'm not real comfortable here.
I don't know who any of you people are. And, I
really don't like strangers walking into my office.
Frank, Frank...
Why don't you go relax, huh.
When you're feeling better, come back here in a
couple of days and we'll talk about it. OK.
Nobody needs to get hurt here today.
What is it you want?
Money. Plain and simple.
Just Frank's share. Is that OK with you, Frank?
I'm afraid I can't comply with that request.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
I don't have a choice?
You have any idea who you're fuckin with?
Let me tell you what's going to happen here.
Let's just suppose you make it out of here alive,
with the money.
One sunny day, 10 years from now,
when you'll be convinced of your new identity...
And feeling very proud about what
you have accomplished...
You're going to go jogging, and by the time you
come back, your wife and kids will be dead.
And I'm going to wait another... 10 years.
And if haven't hung yourself out of remorse...
I'm kill you.
That's not going to happen.
You better get used to the idea.
Imagine a room, just like this one...
Filled with paperwork documenting every illegal
transaction you have done in your life.
And, now, imagine we with a key to that room.
Who are you? CIA.
Really?
We've been watching you and Mr.
Frank Smith, here, for a very long time.
Now, we're going to back to the beginning.
I'm going to count to three and we are
all going to lower our guns, slowly.
One...
Two...
Three.
That wasn't necessary.
I don't like witnesses.
Let's go.
Let's go!
Call the vault, and tell them I'm on the way.
Do it now, Jane.
It's okay Jane, go ahead.
Yes, sir. Right away.
Sam, it's Jane. Mr. Redvale is on his way
down to the vault with some associates.
And, asked that you have it open
for him when he gets there.
Yes, right now. Thank you.
That's very good, Jane.
What the fuck is wrong with you? Huh! Let's go.
Fuck you. Fucking asshole.
So, CIA gone bad, huh? I never knew a good CIA.
Couldn't agree with you more.
Looking for a retirement plan? Exactly.
Why don't you come work for me?
You would never trust me.
Hello, Sam. Sir, is everything all right, Mr.
Redvale?
Everything is all right, Sam.
Jesus Christ, man!
Open it.
Fuckin' "A"
Fuckin' "A", indeed.
There you go. 100 million in in hundred dollar bills.
Just like we agreed, Frank.
This is your money.
You really gonna let this happen?
And, you got a better idea, John?
You'll never get out of here with that money.
Do you really think so, Frank?
You want to make a bet?
How about it Frank?
I'll bet you $10,000.
Oh, that's your money we're betting with, right.
You're not looking so good, Frank.
The odds are in my favor.
I'm looking for Frank Smith.
Yeah, I just saw him. He went down to the vault.
Sir, sir!
Son of a bitch.
I need your help.
Tell them I'm feeling weaker.
Fredo, take this bag up to the roof.
Call the chopper and have them at the ready.
Yes, Sir.
Tell them we'll be another 10 minutes.
Marcus, is that you?
You're trapped, Zander. Give it up.
You didn't kill him?
Get over here, move. Move!
Should have listened to Floria...
killed you when I had the chance.
There's a lot of money here, Marcus.
So, don't be a fucking idiot. Huh.
Take the bag that you got and
get the fuck out of here.
Oh, it's not going to be that easy.
There's only one path out of here and
you have to cross me to get there.
You are outnumbered, Marcus.
You're all alone.
What, you think you got leverage
because you got Smith and Redvale?
Uh...
I don't give a fuck about them. You could put a
bullet in their head right now, for all I care.
I can't breathe. His blood pressure is dropping.
I think he's having another heart attack.
Hang in there, Mr. Smith. Hang in there.
I need some help here?
What's wrong with you people? Shut up.
He's gonna die!
Sounds like your losing your numbers, Zander.
But, there is something else.
Oh... God...
No...
Shut up. No!
You hear this, Marcus? You hear this, Marcus?
Our doctor friend is trying to be a hero in here.
You might want to reconsider your position
or I'll put a bullet in her head.
OK. I'm sending out a little package
to help you change your mind.
This is your last chance, Marcus.
Take the money and get the fuck out of here.
That's what you came here for, isn't it?
Throw your gun down, Marcus.
I said, throw your gun down.
You got to the count of three
before I blow her brains out.
Leave her out of this.
Yeah, you keep walking sweetheart.
One...
Two...
There you go, Marcus.
Okay, Rachel, you kick that gun over here.
Come on, Doc, you can do it. NOW!
Come on, Doctor.
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel...
I'm so very disappointed in you girl.
Three.
When this is over, I'm going to kill you.
Help her. Call the police.
Thank you.
911, we have an emergency at the Gardian Building.
We need assistance.
Block that elevator.
Come on!
Fuck!
Zander? Come on, get the fucking key.
Grab the bags, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Give me the key to the elevator.
Fuck.
Ok, get ready.
Go!... Go, go, go.
Top priority is to take down Marcus Jones.
He is armed and dangerous.
Blocked stairways, block the elevators.
Go.
I spared your life.
You can have half the money.
What more do you want?
I trusted you.
You trusted me to clean the shit out of this world.
That's always our mission.
Nobody buys it anymore, Marcus.
Only you and Dietrich.
I was just like you, Marcus.
I believed in the mission.
But I was blind, just like you are now.
What I see is nothing but a man who has given up.
Don't even go there my friend.
I spared your life once,
I'm not going to do it again.
Captain, this is Team A, we cleared the top five
floors and found no sign of the suspect.
Continue searching.
Yeah, we go it a casualty here,
but it's not your man.
Where is he?
We cleared the building, we couldn't find him.
How do you mean, you couldn't find him?
We checked on every floor.
Is this the man you saw in the vault?
Yes, that's the man that saved my life.
Take her to my office.
That's quit a story, my son.
Have faith that our Lord, Jesus Christ
and he will lead you out of the darkness.
Pray with me.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
in earth as it is in heaven.
And, give us this day, our daily bread.
And, forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom and the
power and the glory, forever.
And ever. Amen.
Amen.
Go with God, my son.
You are forgiven.
Here... here.
