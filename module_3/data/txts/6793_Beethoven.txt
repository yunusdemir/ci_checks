Slow down, slow down. Move it back up.
- Here we go.
- They're drivin' me crazy!
- Don't go too fast.
- Come on!
- What's the matter?
- You threw the cage on my foot!
- I didn't do that.
- Yes, you did.
I need puppies.
- Okay. All right. Come on.
- Puppies.
Hi there. Isn't that the sweetest?
- He's cool.
- I think he likes us.
What a cute guy.
Isn't he cute?
Hi, puppy.
No, absolutely not.
How big's he gonna be?
St. Bernards get to be about 150 pounds.
I got a junkyard.
I need a big, mean junkyard dog.
Let me see him.
Come here, puppy.
He looks good and mean.
I don't know. He's pretty sweet.
You can make any dog mean.
Damn little beast! God!
You got any pit bulls?
Come on. It's a pushover.
I cased the place.
What about the cops?
What about video surveillance?
You're crazy if you're gonna walk up
just like this.
What about the alarm?
All you gotta do is step over.
- I got you.
- Okay, okay.
There, you see?
In and out, quiet as a mouse.
Let's get some dogs.
Come on, puppy.
We're just goin' for a little car ride.
Look at the wee, little ones.
Come here, little puppies.
Here we go.
Come on, puppy. Here puppy, nice puppy.
I've stepped in the beam.
Here, puppy, nice puppy.
See, didn't I tell ya?
Doesn't this beat
takin' strays off the street?
- You are a genius!
- Get off!
Sorry! I'm sorry.
I'm just a little bit excited.
That's my very first felony.
I've committed a lot of misdemeanors,
but that was my first felony.
Why are they barking?
They're dogs.
I know they're dogs!
Go in the back and check.
Okay, doggies, what's the racket back...
Okay, doggies, back in your house.
Back in your house.
Here, doggie, nice doggie.
No, doggie. Don't jump.
Bad dog!
Good puppy!
Bad puppy, don't jump!
Good puppy, don't jump!
Come back! Stop the van!
Harv, what is it?
Why did you want me to stop?
Hurry, they're gettin' away.
Hey, you, come back here!
Come here! I'll give you a bone!
Come back here, you little runt!
Come here, you!
7:00 AM. Up and at 'em!
Ted, I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
Did you have another nightmare?
Yeah.
Mom, it's Saturday and it's 7:02.
Do we really have to get up?
Yep, you heard your father.
I know, Daddy's rules.
That's it! I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Mom, I have a news flash for you.
It's Saturday!
- Yeah, I know, honey.
- This sucks!
Why do we have to get up
so early on Saturday?
Ask your father. Don't say "sucks."
The bathroom's mine!
- Nanny, nanny!
- Shut up! Let me in.
Open up, you little wimp! Let me in!
- Mom! Let me in!
- You have no bladder control.
Wait till I get my hands on you. Let me in!
A puppy!
Hi!
Guys, do you have to...
I dreamt I had a puppy, and it came true!
Honey.
I take back everything I said
about you being cold and insensitive.
Dad, I take back
anything I ever said about you, too.
Dad, I have everything I ever wanted.
- I owe you big time.
- Why?
Daddy, can we call him Fred?
- Let me have him. It's my turn.
- No, it's my turn!
- I saw him first!
- I'm gonna have him for five more minutes.
We can't have a dog. We can't have a dog!
You can't show a child a puppy,
then take it away two minutes later.
I didn't show a child a puppy.
It's obviously lost.
- Occupy the kids. I'll run to the pound.
- No, no way!
- It'll be destroyed.
- If we keep it, the house will be destroyed!
- It's a dog. Millions of people have dogs.
- Not people like me.
Dogs sniff. They lick, they chew.
They drool, they scratch...
- Alice, they have parasites.
- Oh, God, yeah.
The kids'll lose interest.
I'll have to care of it.
It'll grow to be enormous.
It'll take over the yard.
The lawn'll look terrible.
When the dog finally settles down, it'll die.
Everybody will be upset. We'll have
to get another puppy. Start all over.
- Do you understand?
- No. Could you be more specific?
- Alice, I need a little support.
- Okay, I'm sorry. All right.
How shall we handle this?
Go tell the kids.
- Come on.
- Come over here.
He loves me the most.
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Dad.
- Can he sleep in my room?
- No, he's sleeping in my room.
- I'm the oldest. He's sleeping in my room.
- He's not sleeping in anyone's room.
Listen to me a minute.
We are "people" people here.
We are "goldfish" people.
We're "ant farm" people.
We're not "dog" people.
Dad, why can't you just give us a chance?
You're always saying
we have to have responsibility.
That's true.
It's my decision. I mean, I've decided.
I knew it!
Better think of something to name him.
When he destroys my house,
I wanna know what to call him!
- Thank you.
- This is temporary.
This is temporary until we find the owner.
Okay, the dog's name will be...
- What is it?
- What's his name gonna be?
You can't change it. That's the rules.
Okay. Emily?
Did you do your name in a crayon?
I don't think words for parts
of the body make good names.
But he's got one of those. I looked.
I'm sure he does, but I don't think Daddy...
wants to stand on the front porch
at night yelling that out.
But that's what you call Uncle Richard.
Okay, the dog's name will be...
You asked for my input.
- What?
- Nothing. Let's just call the dog Rover.
- Mom, please, M. C. Hammer.
- Ultimate Warrior.
M. C. Hammer? No, no, Rover.
He doesn't like any of those names.
- Right! Like you can read his mind!
- Ryce!
Emily, what does the dog
want his name to be?
This is ridiculous! It's a dog.
He doesn't have preferences!
Call him Ding Dong.
He wouldn't know the difference.
Yes, he would!
He'll tell us what he wants to be called.
Beethoven.
Roll over. Come on, boy. Roll over.
You!
No, no, no!
If this business is gonna grow,
we need more money.
They're talking about $25,000.
I said, "That's no good."
They said, "No?" I said, "No."
If this is gonna take off,
I need some capital, not a Band-Aid.
They said, "What kind of figures
are we talking about?"
I said, "$150,000 sounds
like a good neighborhood to me."
You really said that?
This is a business.
What am I gonna do with $25,000?
Advertising, signs, but I'm optimistic.
- Ted, get down here.
- Where's my shoes?
- I don't know, honey, just backtrack.
- Mom, please?
Look behind the bathroom door.
- Daddy?
- What?
He wants you to scratch his head.
You know, I don't wanna scratch his head.
Back off, back off!
But he wants you to.
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
That's not how it works.
If I don't get this deal, I'll kill myself!
Honey, don't talk like that
in front of the kids.
If I can just get them to smell the stuff.
Air fresheners are visceral products...
- I got a great idea.
- What?
Can I have karate lessons?
I didn't get any bacon.
What do you want karate lessons for?
Brenda's littler than me,
and she's got a green belt.
Why don't we skip the lessons
and get you the belt?
No! Come on!
He slimed me! He slobbed! Look at this!
Don't worry about it.
I've got dog drool on my pants!
I can't meet with Vanguard Capital
with dog drool on my pants!
- Just change your pants.
- I'm gonna change my pants.
I had a schedule and now it's gone.
I'll never have that again!
- Just change, George.
- I'm gonna change my pants.
Then I gotta change my jacket.
If I change my jacket, I change my shirt.
If I change my shirt, I change my tie.
I have to change my belt, shoes and socks.
Just change your pants, George.
I don't need you to drool all over me,
for God sakes!
You're so smart!
What am I telling you about?
Listen to me!
Bye, honey.
Sorry. Good luck.
A little Kleenex or something.
Hi, puppy.
Thirsty, huh?
Easy, buddy. Save some for the fishes.
Look at Tom. He's wide open. Shoot it!
Put it up. Put it up!
- This guy's all over me.
- Shoot it.
Yeah!
All right, that's it. Hit the showers.
Give me 10. Let's go, hustle.
Hi, Mark.
- You're sweaty.
- You like it?
Air fresheners are the 12th fastest-growing
area in household hygiene.
Fascinating!
All of these use a two-dip process
that guarantees a longer smell life.
Smell this. That smell nice?
If we get the right amount of capital,
we can take this place to the top.
I don't just mean successful.
I mean dominant.
Here's a favorite. Look at this.
- New leather.
- That's cute.
- I could use that in my Beemer.
- I could use it in my Beemer!
A lot of people could use 'em
in their Beemers.
I wouldn't want to hang it
from my rearview mirror. Tacky!
No, there's Velcro on the back.
People hide them.
A lot put it under their dashboard.
Ingenious! Bravo, Newton. Kudos.
Thank you.
Let's get Ted.
Hey, Teddy boy.
That's a nice lunch you got there.
- A veritable nutrition lesson.
- Oh, yeah.
Don't forget to wash it down
with a big glass of milk.
Oh, man!
See ya on the bus.
Hi! Miss Simpkins made me stay after.
Want a Twinkie?
Hold on a minute.
Good boy.
See over there?
That's Donna Ditsworth.
She's the most popular girl
in the whole school.
Her hair is perfect. Her teeth are perfect.
Even Mark thinks she's perfect.
Beethoven!
Hey, check out Fido.
- What a cool-lookin' dog.
- I bet you wanna play fetch.
You gotta give me the stick
if you want me to throw it.
Where we going?
- Cool dog.
- Cool dog.
Is he yours?
- What's his name?
- Beethoven.
- Wow. Hi, Beethoven.
- Hey, Beethoven.
Cool dog. Good boy.
Well, see you later, Ryce.
Yes! He knows my name!
He knows my name.
No question about it. You've built yourself
something impressive here.
Thank you very much.
- That mean you're interested?
- Absolutely.
We've smelled a lot of stuff.
I speak for myself as well
as the "Brie Meister" when I say...
yours smells the best.
That's great. Thanks a lot.
We're gonna crunch some numbers.
- Maybe we can get together later.
- That would be great.
- We're looking forward to it.
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
- Ciao.
- Ciao, George.
- Ciao, bello.
- Ciao, bello.
- Ciao!
Ciao.
Ciao.
How ya doin', Theodore?
- Nice backpack, Teddy!
- Can I see it?
Sorry!
Why do you guys always pick on me?
'Cause you're a little four-eyed dork.
Give them back!
They're mine. Give them back!
Where you going, Teddy?
Wait up, Theodore. We wanna walk you home.
What are you, a chicken?
Come on. Scaredy-cat!
Scared? Come on, fight me.
- Now he can't even see.
- Blind as a bat!
What's going on here?
He looks mean!
Yeah.
- Give him the glasses.
- Sorry.
And don't come back!
I know it doesn't mean that he likes me.
But he's gotta like me better
than before he said my name.
You think he could like me, Beethoven?
I know you like me.
Good night, sweetheart.
You, out!
Good night, Beethoven.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Dad.
Mark.
All right! You, in here!
You sleep in here. I sleep there. You...
See, that's very nice.
That's progress. I appreciate that.
Good night.
Good night.
Ever since you started looking
for investors you seem...
- You wanted us to expand.
- I want you to be happy.
You even said you'd come back to work.
I said I'd give you one wish
for your birthday.
I wish you'd come back to work.
There's other things that are important.
I like being home when the kids get home.
I don't want them
to come home to some stranger.
We'll get a great baby-sitter,
somebody reliable that the kids'll love.
In the third occurrence this month.
We've seen a 500 percent increase
in the reported incidence of stolen pets.
Police believe an animal kidnapping ring
is at work.
That's News Break. Back to The Wolfman.
- Did you hear something?
- No.
I heard something downstairs.
You were right. The TV was on.
I don't know.
I hope I'm doing the right thing.
It feels like a good idea to expand...
but I don't want to do it
at everybody's expense.
We have to get somebody wonderful
to take care of the kids.
No question about that.
Sometimes it's hard
to know what the right thing is.
No matter how many showers I take...
I still smell Beethoven all over me.
Are you okay? You're so quiet.
You're not mad at me, are you?
Oh, baby!
Oh, baby, it's not even Saturday night.
Alice, you drive me crazy.
Has Daddy's little girl
been naughty tonight?
George?
Who you talking to?
How dare you! Are you crazy?
Did you think
you were gonna get away with it?
That's how you do it!
I'll put a stop to that.
You've ruined my life!
You've ruined my furniture!
You've ruined my clothes!
My family likes you
more than they like me.
Why? All you do is drool and shed and eat.
You're never getting
out of there again. Never!
Do we understand each other?
Hey, little buddy. How ya doin'?
Thank you. Good work.
- Vernon!
- Come on, Harvey.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
- I don't like it when you tease the dogs.
- Are you some kind of animal lover?
We've developed a new type of ammunition.
It explodes on contact.
We'd like you to use
this revolver for the tests.
We want to know the extent
of the damage at close range.
You wanna know how messy it is.
I presume you can get dogs
with big skulls for the tests.
Newfoundlands, Great Danes, St. Bernards.
Large dogs are difficult to come by...
harder to manage.
I'm sure we'll be able to handle it.
- Mr. Newton?
- Yes.
I'm Dr. Varnick. This must be Beethoven.
He's a magnificent animal. Magnificent!
Magnificent!
- In for his shots?
- That's right.
He'll be a little groggy this evening.
That'll be nice.
Perhaps you should leave him overnight
for observation.
- I'd be happy to.
- Dad!
It's just a shot. He'll be okay.
Let's take him home.
He's scared and wants to go home.
I wonder if I might have a word
with you privately.
Sure.
Good dog.
Take good care of these nice people.
They aren't gonna hurt Beethoven,
are they?
Nothing could hurt Beethoven.
Please, sit down.
Mr. Newton, have you...
Have you noticed anything strange
about your dog lately?
You know, I mean, he's destroyed my life.
I wish I was kidding.
That's very funny.
St. Bernards have been heavily over-bred.
There's been quite a bit written
about certain behavioral problems.
What kind of problems?
I don't know how to say this, but I've had
to put down several over the past months.
They have a tendency to turn on people...
attack without provocation.
I only mention this
because you have children.
Good boy!
George, come on.
Beethoven isn't even remotely dangerous.
He'd never hurt the kids.
He might take a bite out of you, though.
First snarl, first any kind of weirdness
and he's gone.
Weirdness? What should I watch for,
his wearing my clothes around the house?
Good boy!
You guys are gonna love Devonia.
I don't need a baby-sitter.
How come you gotta
go back to work, anyway?
There's no point of us
going into this with a bad attitude.
Hi there, you little cutie!
Don't you worry about a thing.
We're gonna get along great. Right, kids?
I'll be back before dinner,
so it's not that long.
We're gonna do neat stuff.
I was hopin' we could sing a tune together.
You like music?
What kind of music?
How about Herb Alpert
and the Tijuana Brass? Oh, sorry.
I am a nut for the disco beat!
Okay, kids, be good.
- You've had some time to think and...
- And we made our decision.
We wanna get in bed
with Newton Auto Air Fresheners.
Excellent! That's just great!
- Thank you very much.
- As quickly as possible.
We can meet our lawyers today
and have the papers drawn up.
That's excellent!
Let us take you out to dinner.
Are there any good restaurants
in this burg?
Restaurants. What?
- Why don't you come to our house?
- We'll barbecue.
Barbecue! Let's live dangerously!
Well, our food may not be great,
but it's not dangerous.
I hope it's better than this espresso.
Help!
Help, somebody!
I love you, too.
Thanks, Beethoven. You saved my life.
But you better go home now.
Mom said to stay in the backyard.
You kids might be interested to know
that I am a performer...
Saturday nights at the Padded Zebra.
Gosh! Emily's in the pool!
The pool?
- Emily!
- What are you doing in the pool?
Get out this instant.
You want to get me into trouble?
- Emily, are you all right?
- I fell in.
Oh, Emily, you must've been so scared!
I thought I was gonna die.
You poor little thing.
Now, you were never
in any real danger, were you?
We don't want you to get into trouble,
so we'll let this be our little secret.
I'd like to call my mother, please.
- Your mother?
- Immediately.
She must've snuck out
while I was watching Ted and Ryce.
It was hot out, so I guess
she wanted to take a little swim.
Where were you while this was happening?
Where I was supposed to be,
inside watching the other two.
If Emily had stayed where I put her,
none of this would've happened.
If you ask me, what these children need
is a little discipline.
What these children need is their mother.
You're fired.
- Honey, it was an accident.
- So what?
It is just that we had a bad baby-sitter.
We'll find somebody responsible
to look after the kids.
- Over my dead body.
- Come on.
We're fine on our own.
You don't have to entertain us.
Do you have any kids?
We have a career.
Big one.
Excuse us.
- Brats.
- Monsters.
If we pull this off...
in six months we will own
Newton Auto Air Fresheners.
Touch it.
Sorry for the delay.
- We...
- No problem.
- Vegetables. Here you go.
- Look at that.
- Here's the paperwork, Giorgio.
- I've got my own chair, honey.
- Look at that.
- You gonna do that now, honey?
Alicia.
- Alice.
- Alice.
I'm sorry. Alice.
Could I have a refill, please?
Sure.
Thank you.
Just right down at the bottom, George.
- This is everything we've discussed?
- Yes, exactly.
Right at the bottom, you can sign.
Don't sign that now.
Let's have something to eat?
- You can read it over...
- Alice, tell me about your dog.
Well, he's a dog.
He sure is! Hello, cutesy-ootsy.
- He's a St. Bernard.
- He's a purebred St. Bernard, isn't he?
Hello. Look at that big old tongue
you've got! Yes!
Look at that. Come here. Oh, yeah.
You wanna come with Mommy and Daddy?
Yes, you do.
Come on. We'll come to Mommy and Daddy.
Come on. Come on.
I just love these big, dumb animals.
I bet you do.
Dogs obey so much better
than children, don't they?
Come here. Look, cutesy-ootsy-oogy.
Mama just loves
this great big doggie-woggie.
The places for you to sign...
are marked by that blue clip right there.
This are all standard stuff?
You sure you wanna
"signee-wignee" right now?
Alice, I'm sorry.
I've got that. You be careful.
I don't want you to break a nail.
Right down there where the blue arrow is.
Right there.
Honey, you sit. I've got this.
You guys don't seem
to have made a good impression.
- I'm crushed.
- Me, too.
I'll cry all night.
I don't like 'em either. But these people
are important to Dad's business.
I hope Beethoven slimes that lady's dress.
If you don't want our capital...
we could find another investment
somewhere else.
- Sure!
- No, no, no.
- Beethoven, down, down.
- Is there some problem?
- No, no.
- Did I miss anything?
No. Giorgio has gone over all the papers...
and he's about to sign.
Just standard stuff, really.
Will you get outta here, you mutt!
I pitched in college.
Beethoven, stop!
Bad dog!
Sit! Stop! Stay!
Oh, no!
Beethoven!
I really don't like our dog.
I really don't like those people.
I don't trust them.
I don't want their money.
I know my opinion doesn't matter,
but I'm not interested in expanding.
If I had been home instead
of helping you impress those morons...
Emily wouldn't have fallen in the pool.
And I'm not re-entering the workforce.
You're gonna have to do this on your own.
And you will.
Somehow you'll make your fortune.
And tucked away behind you, deep
in the shadows, will be me and the kids.
That's how you see me.
Suddenly I'm a lousy husband and father.
Everything was fine
until Beethoven came into our lives.
I've tried to be patient, but I've had it.
The dog has to go.
I'm proud of Beethoven.
Those two idiots insulted your kids
and treated me like dirt.
He was the only one who had the nerve
to give them the ride they deserved.
I'm going to bed.
My dream's going down the drain,
and you're worried about a dog.
Your family's going down the drain,
and you're worried about a dream.
Why do we gotta be so quiet?
You're a big boy!
- Sit down.
- We made you breakfast, Dad.
- Scrambled eggs the way you like them.
- I fed Beethoven.
We washed him, too.
You should smell him.
I'll walk Beethoven every day.
We divided up the dog chores so you won't
have to do anything for Beethoven.
I see.
Is there anything else you need?
Anything else at all?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
I dropped part of an eggshell in there.
Chew carefully, Dad.
Okay, fine. Great, Ryce.
I'm gonna get that thing.
- That leaf's mine.
- I get the next one!
Okay, fine. Get that question box.
Give me five.
Shake.
Mrs. Newton.
- Yes.
- I'm Dr. Varnick, the veterinarian.
I'm sorry to trouble you,
but I wonder if I might come in?
Sure. Come in.
With animals as large as yours...
I like to do a follow-up on rabies shots
just to see how he's doing.
- It's nice of you to come down here.
- No trouble at all.
- Here you go.
- Thank you. I'll only be a moment.
- Would you like a lemonade?
- No, thank you.
All right.
Beethoven, how are you doing?
Lookin' good. Lookin' good.
Beethoven, this is gonna hurt you
a lot more than it hurts me.
But it's a great benefit to mankind.
Put some of this here.
- I'm gonna get those bones.
- No, I get some!
You get the next.
Okay, that'll do ya.
All right now.
- No!
- Emily, what's the matter?
Come on, you big stupid mutt!
Help! Help!
George! Oh, my God!
Help, somebody! Help!
Good boy. Good boy!
Beethoven! Beethoven!
- No!
- Get off him.
Beethoven!
Beethoven. Oh, my gosh, Beethoven!
Why'd he do that?
My gosh, look what he did!
- Are you all right?
- Well, I don't know.
- What happened?
- He just lunged at me!
That's not true. I saw you hit Beethoven.
- Emily, please.
- Why would I? I patted him on the head.
It's possible that from a distance the child...
Liar!
- Emily!
- I'm sorry. Everything's all right.
It's very natural the child would want
to defend her dog.
- Let's call an ambulance.
- No, I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of this myself.
I'm terribly sorry.
He's never done anything like this before.
Once an animal crosses the line
and attacks a human being...
you can rest assured he'll do it again.
Of course, next time
it could be one of your children.
I'm very, very sorry. Let me help.
Mr. Newton, we have a real problem here.
The law is very clear
when it comes to dealing with this.
Unless you bring the animal
to my office immediately...
I'm afraid I'll be forced to press charges.
I'm so sorry.
I don't want anything
to happen to Beethoven.
Dad won't believe us
'cause he hates Beethoven.
He's always hated Beethoven.
Dad has Beethoven!
Wait, wait! Stop!
Stop! Daddy!
Wait!
Wait!
My dad had to take our dog
to the vet to be put down.
I hated him for it.
Now I'm doing it myself.
I know you won't believe me,
but I don't wanna do this.
You understand.
It's not your fault.
- Mr. Newton.
- Dr. Varnick.
I know that you're doing the right thing.
I hope so.
Follow me.
Come on. Come on.
How's your arm?
It's fine.
- Thirty-seven stitches.
- I'm so sorry.
Do you want the collar and tags?
- Some people like to keep them.
- Yeah.
Do you mind? I have the bad wing.
Come here. Come here.
I'm sorry.
You were my dog, too.
Sad state of affairs.
Sad state of affairs.
Come on, boy. Come on.
Come on, boy.
In you go. There you go.
All right. Magnificent.
George Newton.
We're gonna have to charge you
for a day's boarding...
because Jimmy, who handles
the lethal injections and disposals...
he doesn't work today, so we're gonna
have to hold the dog overnight.
Should we bill you?
Dog killer!
Nice dog, huh, Doc?
He's perfect for the animal experiment.
Get everything ready.
I'll be by in the morning.
We'll do the test on him first thing.
All right.
Nice doggie, good doggie.
Okay, close the door.
I've got him. Come on!
Good doggie. Come here, doggie.
- Okay, I got him.
- Good, good.
- I got him. Come on, doggie.
- Not you! The dog!
Put him in. Okay, you got him?
In the cage. Get in.
Shut up!
There.
Doc will work on him
first thing in the morning...
and then he's one dead puppy.
Can we eat?
- Yeah. You hungry?
- Yeah. I'm hungry.
- What do you feel like?
- A chef's salad.
Did I do the wrong thing?
I don't know, honey.
Beethoven made this house real.
He put the dents in it.
I know he slobbered and he smelled bad,
but he loved us.
Even you.
I just hope your motives were pure,
and you did this for the safety of the kids.
I really hate to think
we sold Beethoven down the river...
for a piece of carpet
or a chance to sell more air freshener.
It had nothing to do with carpet
or air freshener. You saw what he did.
I know. But we don't know why he did it.
Maybe the vet didn't hit him, but maybe
he handled him too rough or something.
Emily's really sticking to this.
Have we ever known her to attack an adult
and accuse them of lying?
No, but why would a vet
say something like that?
Instead of listening to some guy
we've met only twice...
maybe we should try listening
to our own child.
Honey, something doesn't make sense.
Can't we just talk to him?
What do you want me to do?
Dr. Varnick, are you sure
you didn't hit our dog?
Yes, Mr. Newton,
I just remembered I did hit your dog.
- Come on!
- It'd make me feel better. Let's go.
- I'm coming with you.
- So am I.
We're all going with you.
I'm terribly sorry.
- We want our dog back!
- Where's Beethoven?
- Kids, let Daddy handle this.
- What can I do for you?
- We want our dog back!
- I'm terribly sorry.
It's too late. The dog's been destroyed.
- Dad?
- Now, wait a minute.
I was told this wouldn't happen
until tomorrow.
I don't believe you!
Take your hands off her! What are you...
I told you he was lying!
What the hell are you trying to pull?
You can't come in here.
This is private property.
Beethoven?
- He's not here.
- Hold it right there.
You have no right to be in here.
Out, all of you.
Where's my dog?
I don't have to answer your questions.
You ordered that dog destroyed,
and it was done. Now get out.
You hit me, I'll have you put in jail
for assault and battery.
Dad!
- Honey!
- That was amazing.
Dad, you were awesome.
- You were really cool.
- I never found you more attractive.
I may need an X-ray.
- He said our dog bit him.
- But he didn't really. Tell him.
There were no bite marks on his arm!
"So what?" What do you mean?
I'd like to file a report on you!
- They're not going to help us?
- Not this year.
- Dad! Dr. Varnick.
- Look!
Let's follow him.
Maybe he'll lead us to Beethoven.
Hold your door. Hold your door.
Shut it.
Dad, haven't you ever followed anyone?
Turn off your lights.
- I think that's the last of it.
- Start getting the dogs.
The dogs?
Yeah! He said we gotta destroy
all the evidence.
I'm gonna check this out.
It's 9:30. If I'm not back in 15 minutes...
call the police.
Don't come in after me.
Before you destroy the dogs, bring me
the St. Bernard for the ammo test.
Okay.
And bring me a little one
for this chemical test.
Sure. I know just the one.
Hurry up.
Latch.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a pioneer.
- Like Davy Crockett, right?
- Right.
Good doggie!
Oh, no! No, no!
I'm saving you. I'm saving you!
He pushed me on the ground,
and I couldn't get up.
Emily, come on. Here, Ryce, take her.
Lock the doors. If I'm not back in 15...
- I'll be back.
- Lock the doors. Lock that one.
Nice doggie.
We're gonna have a field test
with this new ammo.
So long.
You're a very foolish man, Mr. Newton.
You should've left well enough alone.
- That was a gun!
- Daddy!
- Mom, get over here!
- There's no time!
I don't know where.
It's a big thing, a warehouse!
- Buckle up.
- You can't drive. You don't have a license!
- We're going in!
- What are you doing?
I don't know. It's a...
Ted! Ted!
- Cool.
- Dad!
Dad! Dad!
My babies! Are you all right?
- Beethoven!
- Beethoven!
- I love this dog. What a good doggie!
- George!
George! Oh, my God!
Be careful!
- Is everyone alive?
- Where were you?
I was shopping! I called the police.
- I jumped. I fell on the guys.
- You're kidding?
- You let Ted drive!
- I didn't let him! Don't yell at me!
I'm not yelling.
I love you, too.
- You're free!
- You can go home!
You're free! You're free!
Go, go!
Sic 'em, boys!
Help! Get outta my way!
Oh, my God!
Out of my way!
Come on, Harvey. Over the fence.
You thought you could get me,
you feebleminded mongrels!
- Stupid, stupid doggies!
- Never! You'll never get me!
- Never!
- Stupid, stupid doggies.
Stupid, stupid doggies!
Stupid, stupid...
You little mangy thing!
And you and you, you little one!
Never! Never!
You little mangy...
What?
The final chapter
of a horror story for animal lovers...
concluded at County Courthouse today.
Ruth Walters has the details.
- Animal lovers everywhere appeared...
- It's us!
...when Dr. Varnick and two associates
were indicted on animal abuse.
These were scientific investigations!
And leading the cheers
were the ring's unlikely captors...
the Newton family of Valley Vista.
I had no choice but to do what I did.
Beethoven is not just some dog
that wandered in off the street.
He's a member of our family
and we love him very much.
Have you always been a dog lover?
Maybe not as much as now.
Thank you.
This is Ruth Walters reporting
from County Courthouse.
Okay, guys. Let's go to bed.
- Do we have to?
- It's been a long day.
- You look beautiful.
- Daddy, you're the best.
- Good night, Dad. I love you.
- Good night, sweetheart.
Say good night to Daddy.
- Can I stay up?
- You are up!
Go to sleep.
Hello? Yeah.
Hold on one second.
Ryce? Who's calling?
Ryce!
- Don't stay on too long.
- Okay.
Dad, who is it?
Somebody who saw you on TV.
Mark something.
Mark.
Hello?
Yeah.
No.
Really? Friday?
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.
Sleep tight.
Good night, Beethoven.
Good night, Sparky.
- Good night, Mitch.
- Good night, Murphy.
Good night, Sally.
Good night, Lacey.
Good night, Fred.
Good night, Eliot.
