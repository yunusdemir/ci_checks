The Guyver unit.
It's been a year since the alien armor
invaded my body,
became a part of me.
A year since I first
became the Guyver
and destroyed
the Chronos Corporation
and their shape-changing killers,
the Zoanoids.
Now Chronos is gone,
but the Guyver stays in me,
calling me to fight...
to kill.
Damn.
Hurry up,
find that shit.
Bingo.
Hey, DC.
Dolls?
The latest technology.
You mix cocaine with plastic,
you can shape it into anything you like.
Melt it back down,
it's 100% pure.
What the fuck was that?
- Benny, check it out.
- You got it.
You starting to regret
that career choice now?
There's nobody up here.
All right, girls, come on, let's hustle.
Let's go.
Let's go,
move it.
All set.
Benny, we're rollin'.
Hey, Benny,
I said we're rollin'.
Holy shit.
What the fuck is that?
Let the man go.
Yeah, right.
Fuck you.
Get him!
Shit.
Fuck. Stay away from me, man.
Stay the fuck away from me.
Don't! Oh!
No, please don't.
Please don't.
Please,
don't kill me,
just arrest me.
Holy shit.
This is Delta 28,
we have severely injured men
at 36th and California.
Request ambulance assistance
and back up.
Hey, Moran,
over here.
Shit.
Yeah, it's him, all right.
"inside Exposé,"
in Three Pines, Utah,
to investigate what may be
a werewolf attack.
Doug Kerlew
and his brother Jud
were exploring some caves
above these woods,
when Jud was attacked
and fatally mauled.
Rangers here are calling it
a bear attack,
but Doug has
a different explanation.
Yeah, I mean,
it changed. Yeah.
It was right before my eyes.
It was a man
and then it was a thing,
you see,
with teeth and claws.
Like one of those cave paintings
I showed you come to life.
No, I wasn't drunk.
You people
calling me a liar?
Man,
my brother's dead, man.
That ain't no lie.
When asked to describe
his attacker,
Doug gave us
this drawing,
which he says
is a copy of the painting
found on the cave wall.
This he claims
is what killed Jud Kerlew.
IE went looking for this cave
to verify Doug's story,
and we found it.
But an archeological expedition
investigating the cave
was suspiciously uncooperative
when we asked to shoot inside.
Next up,
more Elvis sightings.
...which he says is a copy
of the painting found on the cave wall.
Hi, Mizky.
Look...
I'm ready to try
to make things better.
I saw the papers
this morning.
It doesn't look
like anything's better.
I didn't come here
to talk about that.
The security guard
died, Sean.
And those gangsters.
How many people are you gonna have
to kill before you realize...
No, I don't kill...
It kills.
Sean, listen to yourself.
You've got to stop this.
It won't let me.
That's crazy.
I know,
and I want to end it.
Will you listen?
There was a thing on TV
this morning
About a werewolf
sighting in Utah.
Werewolves...
Zoanoids.
If you saw
Lisker or Balcus for the first time,
- what would you think?
- God! Stop it!
I don't want
to hear it anymore.
There are
no more Zoanoids.
Chronos is gone.
Can't you let it go?
What's the point
of holding on?
And you go over it and over it,
and you get crazier and crazier.
When do you
just say that...
This isn't gonna work,
is it?
Hey, thanks.
Excuse me, there's an archeological dig
going on near here.
Do you know
where it is?
Customer waitin'.
You gonna buy something?
Uh, yeah.
- Well?
- $1.95.
Do you know how to reach them?
I have to get to that dig.
Don't know nothin'.
Ask down at the rangers.
What do you
want at the dig?
Excuse me?
I said, "what do you want
at the dig?"
- Do you work at the dig?
- Maybe.
- You have business there?
- I have to see it.
You with the press?
It's a private site,
you know.
No, no, I'm not a reporter.
I just need to...
Need to what?
Look...
I've been doing these
for months.
They're like the ones I saw on TV,
the ones from your cave.
See, I see it in my dreams
and I put it down on paper.
Yeah, I know
what it sounds like.
What?
You've seen this?
You've seen this.
I, uh...
I can't help you.
Thanks, Warren.
- Please take me there.
- Sorry, I don't think so.
Wait, I need to know.
I can't,
I'm sorry.
Will you wait
a second?
Would you back away
from the truck, please?
Wait! I need to know!
Damn.
Get in.
I'm Cori Edwards.
I'm a researcher
up at the dig.
And you are...?
Sean Barker.
And...?
Look, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to freak you
out back there.
It's just...
This is important to me.
Nice to meet you.
So, um...
Why'd you come back?
Because I'm a scientist.
I know what it's like
to need to know.
Thanks.
So, what do you
want to see?
Right.
Come on.
Just be cool
and follow my lead.
Hope I'm not getting
you in trouble.
Not if you do
what I say.
Mary,
take this to the commissary,
will ya?
And don't hog
it all to yourself.
- Morning, Miss Edwards.
- Morning, Grau. He's okay, he's with
me.
Watch your head.
Do all archeological
expeditions
have this
much security?
We didn't until your buddy
on TV broke in.
Cori!
Cori, over here.
Take a look at this!
Um, wait here.
I'll be right back.
You shouldn't wander
off like that.
You know, if anybody
asked about...
You know this means
as much to me as it does to you.
But they're telling me the operation
is costing too...
- Come on.
- If we don't hit pay dirt soon,
- they're gonna shut us down.
- "Pay dirt"?
I'm tired of them treating this
expedition
like an oil well.
I know, I know, but they're
management.
Arlen, you and I
had an agreement.
I find you your "pay dirt,"
but I run the show my way.
Hey, that's what I want.
And I'm gonna keep them off
as long as I can.
- Just do a good job, okay?
- I can't make miracles.
Yes, you can.
That's why you're here.
Dad?
Dad, I'd like you to meet Sean Barker
from State.
He was supposed to come up earlier,
but he had to finish up a project.
Sean, my father,
Marcus Edwards.
- Good to meet you son.
- Sir.
We can use the help.
Uh, this is Arlen Crane,
our Operations Director,
And Gus Volker,
our Security Chief.
Welcome aboard.
Nice to meet you.
Soon, Marcus, okay?
Administration.
Well, you go
get him set up.
I've gotta go
crack the whip.
Okay.
Thanks, dad.
Come on.
- I don't get it.
- This is where you want to be, right?
- Yeah, but...
- So be happy.
- Hey, Bob!
- Yeah?
- Come down here for a minute.
- Sure.
Okay, but we're playing
with my cards.
Bob, this is Sean.
Sean, Bob.
Show him the ropes, will ya?
I'll be back soon.
Sure.
Come on.
Lisker.
So, what exactly
are we digging up here?
Well, we think it's some variety
of pachycephalosaur.
Although it's kinda small
for that family.
See, once we carbon date it, then we'll
get
a real good idea what era it's from.
It's funny, once I was
on this dig in Arizona...
Wow, looks like
you really immersed yourself.
Yeah.
It's like I was digging up
parts of myself.
You're not some kind
of archeology groupie, are you, Sean?
Just that I...
can't figure you out.
I mean, why is coming here
so important to you?
Where did you see
those drawings?
I told you.
Oh yeah, right.
Sean, I brought you here
like you asked.
Don't you think I deserve
a real explanation?
A hint even?
Cori...
I want to...
but I can't.
I... I don't really know
what I'm looking for.
I know, I know,
that's no answer.
Yeah, your specialty,
I'm beginning to discover.
Well, listen, maybe we should just
call today a field trip
and tomorrow we'll
send you on your way.
No! I need to stay.
Look, I know I've got
no reason to be here.
You don't even know me.
But I need to stay.
Why?
Because I can't
be anywhere else.
I've got nowhere else to go.
I'm sorry.
That's just not good enough.
I thought you said you knew
what it was like to need to know.
I wonder.
Damn it.
Wait!
It was around here
that we saw him somewhere.
You think maybe we could do this
when there's a little more light?
You want this werewolf or not?
Look, you got about another
half hour, Mr. Kerlew.
After that,
I'm calling it quits.
Just hang on
to your checkbook.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You think you're
the only one?
You think you're
the only one?
My dad and I are known
among the academic community
as "outlaws of science."
We're thinking
about getting jackets made up.
Outlaws? Why?
Oh, because of our
unconventional theories.
We take on
the wild stuff.
You know, the stuff that people laugh at
in the tabloids...
Bigfoot,
crop circles.
And the cave
paintings?
You have a theory
on them?
You know, I want
to tell you...
but I can't.
Touché.
What was that?
I don't know.
I heard someone shouting.
- Oh no, it could be another bear
attack.
- Shit.
You go and get help,
I'll take care of the bear.
Right.
He'll take care
of the bear?
Oh shit!
Take a picture!
Take a picture!
Screw the picture,
you brain-dead hayseed! Shoot it!
What about my money?
- What about my money?
- Shoot it!
Shoot it!
- Hey! Help! Professor Atkins, help!
- Cori, what's wrong?!
I think there's another bear attack.
Somebody's in trouble.
- I'll get my gun. You go get the truck.
- Get the truck, right.
- Hurry, Sean's out there.
- What?
Guyver.
Don't you come near me,
you son of a bitch.
You shouldn't have come back.
It can't be.
Guyver?
Get away from him,
zoanoid.
Where did you come from?
I destroyed all of you.
What are you doing
in the camp?
Damn.
Over here.
This way.
- What happened? Where's the bear?
- I don't know.
I think the sound of your engine
drove it off.
- Oh my...
- Not soon enough.
Look,
that one's alive.
Oh! Whoa, man,
stay away from me.
Don't touch me.
You're one of them.
Shit. Look at him,
he's scared crazy.
Take it easy,
we're here to help you.
Are you all right?
- He's in shock. Get me a blanket.
- Yeah, right.
Make that two.
I'm just sorry
I didn't get here sooner.
Thank God you didn't.
You could've been killed.
What'd you think you
were going to do?
I was wondering that myself.
All right, let's get him
in the truck.
I got you. I got you.
You two, wrap that one up
and put him in the back.
I'll keep us covered.
Okay, let's move out.
I've never seen
one this big before.
Who are you?
When did he appear?
He was on the scene
before anybody else.
Barker, Sean Barker.
Not at this time, but analysis
of the samples should...
I have to go.
What'd you hear?
What?
Nothing.
- I didn't hear anything.
- Then why'd you follow me?
I... I...
Let me guess...
Just curious, right?
I saw you leave camp
in a hurry.
I just figured you'd
seen the bear again.
Now, you and I both know
there wasn't any bear.
- We do?
- Spare me the dumb act.
I know you got claws
you ain't showing.
Claws?
I'm not the one
with the claws.
I don't know what
you people are up to,
but innocent people
are getting killed
and I can't allow
that to happen.
Wait, you're
with the government.
And you won't live long enough
to give me away.
What do you think
you were doing?
- Sorry, Mr. Crane.
- Tell the others we may have an
active...
What are you men
doing there?
Uh, we thought we saw
the bear again, Mr. Crane.
Well, for God's sakes then,
stay in camp.
We don't want anymore
corpses on our hands.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I gotta go.
Wait!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
We don't need
this kind of attention.
If you can't keep a tighter rein
on your lieutenants...
I'm sorry, sir,
I'll correct my error.
But it did bring
something to light.
The Guyver.
He's here.
He must be someone
in the camp.
The hunted comes
to the hunter.
Find out who he is
and bring him here, quietly.
Don't worry, sir,
I can handle it.
- Morning, Bob.
- Yeah, good morning.
This wasn't here
yesterday.
Cori, you can tell me.
You like him?
- None of your business.
- I'm just excited for you, that's all.
I mean, it'd be nice to know
someone's finding a little romance.
All right. He's cute,
but nothing is happening.
- He's a little...
- Hi. Coffee?
Did I miss something?
Uh, no, Sean,
have a seat.
That'll be all.
Check on you in a bit.
Take your time.
So, how goes the quest?
Well, I was
just wondering...
what kind of skeletons
are we digging up again?
Well, um,
we're not sure,
but we think it's a kind
of pachycephalosaur,
Although it's a little small
for that genus.
Once we carbon date it,
we'll know where
to place it, but right...
What?
You know, that's almost
word for word what Bob said.
What are you guys hiding?
They're not dinosaurs
at all, are they?
Look, everybody here knows
what we're digging for.
So why all the secrecy?
We can't just go spouting
crazy theories to the world
until we have the hard evidence
to back it up.
Dad and I have been putting this puzzle
together for five years.
I'm just praying it isn't another
"explainable mystery."
If we're wrong again...
So why don't you
stick to the safer stuff?
Why don't you go home?
I am not gonna let anybody
take this away from us.
Well?
It feels like leather.
It's soft.
Here, give me that.
That don't sound
like leather to me.
Hey, Dr. Edwards!
Dr. Edwards, over here.
What have you got,
my dear?
Listen.
This is wonderful.
Call my daughter,
inform Mr. Crane,
Get everyone in here
on the double.
I think we found it.
Dad, what's going on?
Corinne,
I think our five years of research
are about to pay off.
But when will we
know for sure?
Patience, Arlen.
We beat your deadline,
just give us the time
to do this right.
But there's been a complication.
Something's come up.
Arlen, please.
Gee, you don't suppose
this is one of those
"explainable mysteries,"
do you?
Just shut up
and dig.
Dr. Edwards, Dr. Edwards!
We took some readings
up the cliff.
It goes all the way to the top.
This thing is huge.
If these cave paintings
are accurate representations,
Then I speculate that it sinks down
another 40 meters
and curves east and west
for 20 meters
In each direction.
It's a ship.
- Bob, have you seen Sean?
- Not lately.
Hey, you okay?
I still can't believe it.
I know what you mean.
We came here
hoping to find anything...
anything that would suggest
an ancient alien visitation.
I mean, we would've
settled for alien beer cans.
Instead we got...
Five years
of getting laughed at,
our research ignored
by our colleagues.
Oh, the paper
I'm going to publish.
But the best part
is that now I have got
the greatest playground
a girl could ever wish for.
Look at this.
It's organic.
It was grown.
That sample I took is alive.
Alive, Sean.
This thing might've been
powered by photosynthesis.
Okay, that's all theory,
But with the funding from our sponsors,
we can find out.
We might even be able
to duplicate it.
Imagine being able
to grow a machine.
No more dirty factories.
No more pollution.
What?
Nothing.
Now I see why
they call you an outlaw.
You haven't even
stepped inside
and already you're
saving the world.
What can I say?
I'm an optimist.
I wish I could see
the world like that.
We, um...
we're missing the party.
I'm not missing
anything.
Come on, let's go.
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
Nothing.
You wanna see something
really scary?
Hey, Cori, come here.
I'll be just a second.
Hey, what are you doing?
What do you know about
the Chronos Corporation?
- I don't know what you're talking
about.
- Come on.
You dated a Mizky Segawa
whose father worked for Chronos.
He was murdered shortly
before the LA branch was destroyed.
Do you know anything
about that?
Only what I read
in the papers.
Hey, less of that shit,
all right?
Let go of me.
I don't know anything.
You knew enough
to know the claws weren't yours.
- What?
- You said the claws weren't yours.
So whose are they?
That's what I thought.
Now, I want to know what you know
about Chronos and what they do.
Why? You said
Chronos was destroyed.
Chronos LA.
Chronos LA?
Jesus.
We know Chronos
is worldwide,
but we don't know
what those things are.
We found breeding tubes
and blood samples,
but never any bodies.
All right, look...
Chronos is
those things...
the whole organization.
They look human,
but they're not.
They change.
You're serious,
aren't you?
You saw that dead guy
last night.
The thing that killed him
is one of the guys in this camp.
- You saw this?
- Yeah.
Then why didn't it
kill you?
I...
- I'll tell you later.
- No, you tell me now.
Don't make me
have to arrest you.
Here?
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah it's fine.
Nice guy.
Kid, you gotta get
your priorities straight.
Well, I'm open
to suggestions.
Damn it!
We've come this far.
Now what?
We can have a laser cutter
up here in two days.
- Three days tops.
- Three days?
Don't we have anything else
in the camp?
Sure, garden tools
and whisk brooms.
Lasers weren't the first thing
on the equipment list.
But we don't have time.
Well, what do you want me to say,
"open sesame"?
Amazing.
It's breathable, and the radiation
levels
are acceptable.
We can continue.
The rest of you may resume your work.
- Cori, it's beautiful.
- Oh.
No one is to touch anything
or enter any sealed room.
We're cataloging only today.
Take lots of pictures and try to map
the interior as you go.
If you have any trouble
breathing, get out.
We're not going to sacrifice anyone
in the name of science.
Got it?
Good.
Cori, you and Sean
go that way.
We'll go through here.
Let's go.
This way.
You have to see this.
Wow.
It's beautiful.
It's really humid
in here.
Can you hear me?
I'm here.
Talk to me, please.
Well?
My God,
how in the hell are we
going to get up there?
No stairs,
no visible access up.
I have a feeling that walking
was optional for these people.
We'll have to jury-rig
something, I suppose.
Get started.
I'm sure what we're
looking for is up there.
I'm here.
Well, you called me here.
Aren't you going
to say something?
Please, I'm trying,
but I don't understand.
Please.
Why did you do this
to me?
What the hell am I?
What am I supposed to do with it?
You got the wrong guy.
I'm not cut out
for this.
I can't live
like this anymore.
I'm not a killer.
I just want to be normal again.
I want my life back!
Dad, look at this.
It moved.
Cori, I told you
not to touch anything.
What have you found?
Let me see that.
No! Give it back!
Cori.
We're the researchers.
It's our job to examine the new
artifacts.
- You don't have the right...
- As founders of this expedition,
we have whatever
rights we choose.
If you don't like it,
you can go back to State
and teach freshman
archeology
while we're making history.
Dad, why don't you
stop him?
This is the most important
discovery we've ever made
and you're letting him
take it away from us.
We'll get
our chance, Cori.
Arlen is just taking it away
for safe keeping.
Safe keeping?
He's stealing it.
Cori, are you okay?
Sean, he's taking
it away.
This is a breach
of contract, Crane.
We'll sue you for this!
We were supposed
to have free rein, damn it!
No interference from the corporation.
Do you hear me?
- Forget it, Cori.
- Dad.
We'll get
our chance, Cori.
Just let it go.
- Cori...
- No! What is the matter with you all?
He took it away from us.
Mr. Crane...
it's about the new kid.
Can I come in?
Can I come in?
What do you want, Sean?
I have to talk to you...
about Crane.
I don't want to talk about him
right now, okay?
Cori, there are things
you need to know.
I don't know how
to tell you this,
but you and your father
have been lied to.
You're working for a corporation
called Chronos,
and Crane
is a part of them.
They...
They're not good people.
Where did you get all this?
I don't know any Chronos.
Our backers are
the Tempus Group.
No, they're Chronos.
Trust me.
The thing you discovered
is very important to them.
It's called
the Guyver unit.
It's...
it's a powerful weapon.
Chronos has been
after it for years.
All the people...
Shit.
All the people
who work for Chronos
can change
into monsters
called Zoanoids.
Volker is one for sure,
probably most of the others.
The monsters
in the cave paintings
and the skeletons you've been
digging up, they're Zoanoids.
The... the bears
that killed those people
are Zoanoids too.
They've lived alongside
us forever.
All the stories you've ever heard about
werewolves or Bigfoot,
they're all...
Cori, I know,
but it's the truth.
- Listen.
- No, you listen...
I don't care who they are.
They put up the money
for this dig when no one else would.
If they pull out,
the ship is gone.
Oh, shit.
We've only just stepped inside.
But is the ship more important
than your life?
You're dealing
with monsters here.
I trusted you, Sean.
I trusted you
not to be crazy.
Damn it!
Crane...
The ship we excavated
is a gold mine, Mr. Gouo.
Now it's time to terminate
all non-Chronos personnel
and bring in our own.
Terminate?
What about Edwards' daughter
and the Guyver?
Don't worry about her,
she's handled.
And the Guyver
is in our hands.
It will be on the way
to you in an hour.
No promises, Crane,
just results.
Mr. Crane...
I think we got a problem.
Hey, Bob,
have you seen Cori?
You guys just can't seem
to connect, can you?
Tell me about it.
Try the commissary,
it's lunch time.
Right, thanks.
Excuse me.
It's calling you,
isn't it?
What do you mean?
It calls me too.
We're both its children.
Sean, I know who you are.
I know your pain.
I'm like you.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
We're the bastards
of an uncaring parent.
We've been violated,
our lives have been
changed against our will.
Sean, I know what
it's been like for you...
for me.
You've lost friends
and lovers, haven't you?
So have I.
We're forced
to lead secret lives.
Trust me.
I know,
Look at me, I'm hideous.
Do you think I want
to be this way?
A freak?
That's why we're here...
to take back our lives.
Somewhere in this ship
Is the key to changing
us back.
Let's find it together.
We can take the Guyver
out of you.
We can make you
normal again.
Isn't that what you want?
I don't know.
- You're killers.
- And so are you.
No, it's the one
that kills, not me.
Then let us help you.
We can make it stop.
What do you say?
Friends?
I...
No.
Pity.
Keep him sedated
until we return to base.
I love my job.
Comfy?
Hey, bitch!
- What did we hit?
- I don't know.
Well, step on it!
Oh my God!
You, girl, get out.
- Shit.
- Run!
You shouldn't have
interfered, Marcus.
Dad?
Dad! Dad!
Don't hurt him.
Leave him alone!
Sleep tight, baby.
- Keep an eye on him.
- Yes, ma'am.
Barker, Barker.
- Atkins?
- You okay, kid?
- What... yeah.
- Listen, I gotta get you outta here.
- The government wants you in one piece.
- What?
My backup is on its way.
This place is about
to become a battlefield.
- Battlefield? Jesus. But the students...
- Shh.
The students are fine.
Now listen,
about this Guyver unit,
what can it do?
Do they know how to use it?
Cori, shit, I've got to get her
out of here.
No, it's too late.
They've already taken her.
- There was nothing I could do.
- Where? When?
About this Guyver unit...
they took the south road 15 minutes ago.
Now look, what about this Guyver unit?
How does it work?
- I've got to go.
- You're not going anywhere. We need
you.
- But she's in danger.
- I'm sorry, I can't let you go.
Now look, this...
Aw, shit.
Shit.
Co-ri!
Cori!
Sean?
Sean! Help!
Help us!
Shit.
Guyver!
Take cover!
Cori.
No!
Sean?
Wait!
It's done, sir.
But...
the Guyver has escaped.
He'll be back.
Mr. Crane, help us.
Mr. Crane,
what's going on?
I'm sorry, your services
are no longer needed.
Nothing personal.
Wait!
You can't do this.
Hey, what is this?
Hey, man, be cool.
You don't have
to do this.
Oh my God!
Don't do anything...
funny.
Thanks for saving
my life.
I wanted to tell you,
but how could I?
How do you tell somebody...
What you told me
was hard enough.
It took a lot
of guts, Sean.
Look...
you don't have
to be nice to me, okay?
You didn't know
what you were getting into.
If you don't want to have
anything to do with me, I'll understand.
It's not the first time.
Hey, it's every
woman's dream
to be rescued by
a knight in shining armor...
Even if he wears it on the inside.
Look, I left your truck
at the top of the hill.
Drive back to town,
find a place to hole up.
I'll meet you
as soon as I can.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- No, it's too dangerous.
Atkins is bringing in a strike force
to arrest Crane and his men.
Professor Atkins?
Commander.
He's with the government.
But he's gonna get slaughtered
if I don't get back there.
I don't care.
I'm going with you.
My father's back there.
I'm not leaving him.
Okay, come on.
Move it, move it!
Come on, people,
double time, let's go!
Let's go!
This is an outrage.
We're a reputable company.
Reputable companies don't conduct
sick experiments on people.
Where's your proof?
A judge would laugh
this case out of court.
Too bad it's not
going to court.
Don't even try it,
unless you think you're faster
than a speeding bullet.
- Camp's secured, sir.
- Secure?
- Where's the other one?
- Capped one in the cave.
- This is the only other.
- No, there's one more.
Where's Corben?
This is becoming interesting,
isn't it, captain?
Eagle 2, this is Eagle 1.
One hostile still at large.
Code red status.
Shoot to kill.
I repeat, shoot to kill.
Read you, Lima Charlie,
Eagle 1.
We'll find him
soon enough.
Or he'll find you.
Mason, Lewis,
intercept the enemy.
Yes, sir!
More lambs to the slaughter?
- Looks like he did it.
- No.
Something's wrong.
Where's his backup?
Come on,
we don't have much time.
Wait!
Would you wait?
What is it?
We have to destroy
the ship.
Destroy the ship?
Why?
Atkins is out there,
everything's under control.
I'm not so sure about that.
Besides,
it doesn't matter who wins.
I doubt the government
is any more responsible than Chronos.
No, we can't.
All that knowledge.
- I'll never get a chance to do the
research...
- Neither will I.
But if we don't
destroy it,
too many people will die
fighting for it.
They want
the weapons, Cori.
That's all
they'll ever want.
You know, that's only
gonna piss him off.
Now that we've wasted
enough time...
I have to take this.
Your hour is up.
Where is the Guyver?
There's been some delays.
The Guyver...
- Crane...
- We'll get him back sir.
He's fixated on the ship.
He won't leave.
Have him here
in an another hour.
Or shall I send someone
with more experience?
No. No, I can handle it.
I'll take care of it.
One more hour, Crane.
If we lose him...
One hour, sir.
Yes, sir.
Shit!
What gets me is that I've spent
my whole life working toward this,
always scared that I was chasing
some pipe dream.
And the minute
I find out it's true...
I have to destroy it.
What's wrong?
Don't fight it.
Go.
Keep setting the charges.
Why do you keep calling me?
Am I not the one
you want?
I'm not the one, am I?
Guyver.
The Guyver
will be back soon.
Let's prepare him
a nice welcome.
What about him?
Bring him. Let's show him
some real soldiers in action.
Come on, Sean,
where are you?
Take her!
Sean!
Sean, help.
An archeologist
destroying the past?
Not accepted scientific behavior,
Miss Edwards.
It's better than handing it
over to you.
The Guyver must be in the ship.
Find him.
Let her go, Crane.
Impressive,
but pointless.
- Are you okay, Cori?
- Yeah.
Sean, don't be a hero.
Deactivate the Guyver
and surrender
or I'll kill her.
Don't listen to him, Sean.
Time's a' wastin'.
Crane!
Stop!
- Crane, we had a deal.
- Dad, help.
Arlen, please,
we had a deal.
Yes, we pay
for your research
and you give us
the weapons.
You should've told
your daughter, Marcus.
It would've saved us
a lot of trouble.
Dad, how could you bargain
with this murderer?
Don't you get it, Cori?
Your dad's a company man.
Stand aside, Marcus!
Now, one last time,
retract the armor...
or I'll tear her apart.
No! You will not
hurt my daughter.
Marcus!
You're fired.
Atkins, catch!
Protect her.
Who the hell's
gonna protect me?
Give me the case.
- The case.
- Yeah...
Just give it to me!
Okay, bitch,
come and get it.
That's mine!
Dad!
Hey, hey.
Bitch.
Do it.
It didn't have to be
this way, Marcus.
We were doing great
things together.
You could've been
somebody in the company.
Junior vice president
in charge of genocide?
I'd rather die.
Then so be it!
No!
Leave him alone.
Back off.
How's he doing?
I don't know.
It's bad.
Why are you attacking
your own kind, freak?
We could've helped you.
I'm no freak
and I'm not like you.
You threaten mankind.
I protect them.
Barker!
- You didn't.
- So tell me,
who's going
to protect the protector?
Bio-morph.
Oh my God.
A Guyver zoanoid.
The next step.
You don't know
what you're doing, Crane.
That unit's damaged.
You have no idea what
it'll do to you.
But it'll do you
just fine.
You can't win, Crane.
The ship told me the truth.
You're an experiment
gone out of control.
No, I'm
in complete control.
The aliens created the Guyver
to fix their mistakes.
You're the mistake.
I'm the final product.
With this alien power,
Chronos will be triumphant
and man shall know
his true destiny...
To serve our kind!
Not if I can help it.
You're cracked, Crane.
You're gonna self-destruct.
Never.
The unit feeds me.
I feel the power
growing stronger.
How does it feel
to be obsolete,
outclassed
by a new model?
Crane!
Sorry, Crane, this model
has been recalled.
No!
No, help me!
Out of control.
Sean!
Sean, we did it.
We did it.
So it looks like
you found your destiny.
Cori, I lied.
The Zoanoids weren't
the failed experiment...
the Guyvers were.
The aliens turned
humans into Guyvers
so we could fight
their wars for them.
But humans rebelled...
out of control.
Guyver is nothing
more than a weapon.
I have no destiny.
You made your own.
You're a hell
of a weapon, kid.
It's a good thing
you're on our side.
I'm not a religious man...
but you may have
just prevented Armageddon.
Who knows how many
more weapons are on board?
Well, now at least they'll
be safe with the government,
- where they belong.
- No.
That's not where
it belongs.
What are you doing?
- Sean?
- Stand back, Cori.
What are you doing,
Goddamn it?
I'm sending it home.
What?
You can't do that.
That's government property.
Stop it!
You're jeopardizing
our national security.
No, I'm saving it.
It's not safe.
Let's go.
Barker?
- This is not the time.
- Barker, we have to talk.
There's nothing
more to say.
I already
told you everything.
Wait! We're launching an underground war
against Chronos.
The government
could use your help.
See you around,
Atkins.
At least tell me
how I can reach you!
See you around, kid.
