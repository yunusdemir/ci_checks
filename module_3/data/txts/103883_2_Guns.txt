Hi.
Hi.
How many?
Two.
Listen, I wanted to get a safe
deposit box.
Can you do that for me?
Okay.
Your box will be available any
time from an hour after opening...
to thirty minutes before close.
And his is your key.
Thank you.
Oh...
um, also, if you open a checking
account...
we will give you 5% off the
box, along with...
free overdraft protection.
Oh, here I was hoping for a
free toaster.
Why would a bank give out
free toasters?
Hello, Ma.
I am ordering you the French
toast.
No, thank you.
Our very patient waitress,
Maggie...
well, at least it says Maggie
on her name tag...
has asked me to order
four times.
If I don't order at this point,
it's just rude.
I can come back.
No, it's okay.
You know what? I am making
an executive decision.
Pancakes.
Okay.
Uh, no pancakes. I don't like
pancakes. No pancakes.
What are you, a communist?
You know, my friend will have
the pancakes, and a fried egg.
I am thinking hash, but only if
it's like chunky style, okay?
Listen, if you order me eggs
and pancakes...
I am going to kick your behind.
Well, you got to eat breakfast.
It's the most important meal
of the day.
Uh, ma'am, ignore everything
he said, okay?
Don't bring me any eggs and
pancakes.
Just bring me some coffee and
bring him a couple eggs.
I don't want eggs.
I want hash.
You know what, put a couple
eggs on it.
Give him some rye toast, too.
No rye toast for me.
I don't like rye toast.
And a pancake.
No pancakes.
Maybe a little silver-dollar one.
You got the little baby ones?
No pancakes, no silver dollars,
no rye toast. I like pumpernickel.
I do have pumpernickel.
Pumpernickel toast.
Hey, Maggie, wait. One more thing.
Yeah.
That's for you.
You take that with you till
we see each other again...
in case you miss me too much,
okay?
Why you got to do that?
What?
Wink at the waitresses like
that?
Waitresses like me.
Nobody likes you.
So?
So.
What do you got?
So, it is a sleepy bank.
Doable?
That's correct.
I told you.
That is a lot of doughnuts.
I will be right back with your
hash.
Maggie, your hot homemade
doughnuts, they any good?
Best in three counties.
I will tell you what you do.
You bring us three of those
bad boys.
Put them in a to-go box for
us, all right?
All right.
Thank you.
All right, time to make the move.
All right, there's going to be
some sirens in this bitch.
I'll go shake the weasel.
Alright, shake the weasel.
Shake the weasel.
Hey, good morning, sir.
How are you?
Morning.
Hey, Maggie.
I am very sorry about my friend.
He was kicked in the head as
a child.
He's really not that bad.
No, he is.
What's going on?
Okay, I am just going to have
you all exit the building.
It might be a false alarm, but
just do it safely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Is everybody out? I am going
to need you to step outside.
All right, Maggie, I am just
going to grab my friend.
Okay.
We got to pay our bill.
We should go.
Is that all you're going to
leave for a tip?
It's 15%.
You leave 15%.
No, you got to leave at least 30%.
No, you don't.
15% is standard.
My Maggie's about to be out of
a job, man. Don't be cheap.
Okay, there's five.
That's seven.
There you go.
Come on.
All right.
What?
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
Oh, my God.
How'd you say it?
Never rob a bank across from the
diner with the best doughnuts...
in three counties?
That's correct.
Bobby.
Papi's down in the stables.
Why don't you get something
to eat?
I am not hungry.
Sure you are.
I want to come with you.
Hey, listen. We're here to do
business. Diplomatically.
Well, I can be diplomatic.
You can be hungry, too, right?
Bobby.
Wait here.
Okay.
Somebody sitting here?
Little Toro.
Oh, well, you move your feet,
you lose your seat, right?
Lose your head, too.
That's correct.
So, where is Little Toro?
Aye, where you put him.
Aqui?
Aye.
Let's play some dominoes.
Papi's ready.
Yeah.
Papi Greco.
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.
That's correct.
Quick, an ostrich, a tank of
ether, a '63 Impala convertible.
Make it a '64.
My side of the border.
I know a guy.
What did I tell you? He never
says no, never says maybe...
never says, "I'll see what
I can do."
Nice bull.
I hope he's a good breeder.
That's a shame about Little
Toro.
Julio caught him skimming.
Oh...
that don't sound like Little
Toro.
Is that for me?
That's correct.
Everybody skims a little cream.
It's human nature.
Just because it's human, don't
mean you let it go.
Hmm.
Nice lines.
That's right.
Good color.
That's right.
He knows a guy.
What you got for me?
Cash.
Cash?
Supposed to be giving me 100,000
to deal.
Why didn't you give me $100,000
worth of cocaine?
Where's the... where's the
cocaine?
My buyer wants cocaine.
So, let him buy cocaine.
That's what he's trying to do.
He's trying to buy cocaine.
I told him I knew a guy,
therefore I come to you.
You the guy I know.
That's why I told him.
So, take back the passports.
After Little Toro, we're not
taking on any new customers.
Well, no disrespect, but I ain't
no new customer.
You been dealing with me for
a long time.
You keep the passports.
Keep the money, too.
When you're ready to give me
the product...
you give me the product.
Till then...
you owe me.
It's not very sporting, man.
At least give the chickens
a chance to shoot back.
Hey, man, I am just saying.
If I am going to kill a
defenseless animal...
I am going to honor its sacrifice
by grilling it...
into some tasty barbecue.
What I am not going to do, is
torture it...
just to prove I can't hit anything
further away than my own pecker.
Your cuate's a real junkyard dog.
Mmm.
Hey, cowboy.
You, the pretty one.
You ever hear the expression...
"You got a face only a mother
can love"?
That don't apply to you.
You are uglier than the devil's
asshole itself.
Stig!
What are you doing?
They're torturing chickens, man.
What are you eating?
A chicken.
Come here.
It's not the same thing, okay?
See that bag over there by
the table?
Buffet table, next to the potato
salad?
Yeah, the bowling bag.
What about it?
Little Toro's head is in that
bag.
Bullshit.
Yeah.
You know what?
That's fucked up, man.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go,
okay? Come on, let's go.
Say it in English, you goat
fuck.
Suck my chicken.
That's funny coming from you,
fat boy.
You ain't seen your pecker since
you were a baby.
Just because you put your finger
in your belly button...
and brown shit comes out don't
mean it's your asshole.
What did you say?
Don't worry about it, man.
Now dig them up and make some
damn barbecue.
Bye, chica.
Did you just wink at him?
I did wink at him, because
he's my bitch now.
Uh-oh.
That's good shooting.
Gracias.
You know, Little Toro never
did nothing to nobody, man.
We should rip off Papi's stash at
the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.
You know, Papi's guy delivers
a briefcase...
full of money to Tres Cruces
every two weeks.
That's got to add up to, what,
like three million at least.
If Papi knew we were even talking
about ripping off Tres Cruces...
it would be our heads in that
bag next to the potato salad.
No way. Our two heads would
never fit in a bag that small.
Come on, man, let's hit the bank.
Little Toro was your friend.
He was my friend.
So?
What d'you mean "so"?
What if it was me?
What if it was my head Papi
ran through the saw mill?
You wouldn't come after him?
Nope.
You wouldn't kill him?
Nope.
Shit, man, he did that to you,
I'd kill him.
You know why I'd kill him?
Because you're my people, and
there's a code.
There is no code, first of all.
You do whatever you got to do,
whatever it takes.
And second?
Right, we're not people because
you, you don't have people.
That's correct.
Purpose for your visit to Mexico?
Quail hunting.
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart
attack, so, we cut our trip short.
Tuba City?
It's near Odessa.
Nice place?
Hellhole, but she's my
favorite aunt.
Don't move. Let me see your hands.
Oh, shit.
Tell us about your trip.
Lawyer.
What's the big deal?
Lawyer.
You were down in Sonora,
weren't you?
You don't think Agent Jessup
and the DEA...
know about you and Papi Greco?
Lawyer, lawyer.
They know you were at his ranch.
I know I need a lawyer.
Tell Agent Rees about Papi Greco.
Who?
Papi Greco.
Well, who's that? Some Mexican
Santa Claus, or something?
Come on, Mr. Stigman.
I think it's in your best
interest to cooperate.
You need to stop playing the
stupid card, all right?
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to
cooperate with whatever you need.
I mean, as an American, I know
you're just doing your job...
and sometimes innocent folks like
me get caught up in the system.
It's like the airlines.
They don't lose your luggage
on purpose, right?
But everybody takes it so
damn personal.
Come on, Mr. Stigman.
So, you want to play games?
Well, what'd you have in mind?
Do you want to help yourself?
Yes.
Do I have to do it in front
of him?
All right, we're done here.
Thank you, Mr. Stigman.
You going to leave?
Oh, yes.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
How do you concentrate working
with her, man?
Five border agents are ripping
apart your car as we speak.
They ain't going to find anything.
Where'd you hide the cocaine?
Can they hear us?
No.
Can they see us?
No.
Okay.
There was no cocaine.
You had a deal in place.
Right.
Five hundred passports in return
for cocaine.
Right.
Hey, Bobby.
How you doing, Deb?
Good. Man, your boy Stig's
a piece of work.
He winked at you, didn't he?
How'd you know?
Bobby didn't get the cocaine.
What?
What happened?
Papi offered me cash.
I told him no.
I told him to keep the
passports, so...
eventually, he's got to come
up with the cocaine.
What about this guy you said
you could flip? Little Toro?
I got him.
It's real close.
I don't know who you are,
anymore.
It's like...
It's like you're out on this
limb.
And you have been out there
way too long.
And you're saying that to
say what?
I don't like going to the
funerals of my own men.
Well, then don't come, boss.
Don't come.
Okay?
I spent the last three years
of my life...
crawling through a Mexican
sewer...
trying to work my way up the
line, to get next to Papi Greco.
You can't take me off this, now.
Jessup, he's close.
He can't take me off this, now.
I know.
Not now.
Two weeks.
You don't flip Little Toro by
then, I am pulling you out.
We're done.
Think Jessup knows about us?
What "us"?
You don't do "us," remember?
Oh, I remember.
Besides, I am dating.
Oh, right, right.
You're dating...
Mmm-hmm.
Your imaginary boyfriend, Harvey.
Uh, he's not my boyfriend, and
his name's not Harvey.
I like Harvey. It has a nice
ring to it. Harvey.
You don't get to be jealous
anymore, Bobby.
Harvey.
You pushed me away.
So you could be with Harvey.
Fuck you.
Little Toro's dead.
You told Jessup you were close
to flipping him.
I was.
But when I got down to the
ranch...
Papi's boys was throwing his
head around in a bag.
Well, that's game, then.
With Little Toro off the board,
Jessup's pulling you out.
Not if you don't tell him.
I am your control, Bobby.
That's correct.
I have to tell him.
That's why I need you...
to let me rob Tres Cruces
Savings and Loan.
You want to rob a bank?
No, Stig wants to rob the bank.
It's his idea.
So, there's no entrapment.
What I want is access to that
money...
that Papi's got in the safe
deposit box.
You know, no judge is going to
give you...
a blanket warrant for the boxes.
We don't need a warrant. Not if
the money's evidence in a crime.
We just trace it back to ownership,
we got Papi on tax evasion...
possible RICO.
Yeah?
Yeah.
And what about Stig?
What about him?
He's a side dish.
You bust him in front of the
bank...
he does a smooth 20 years in the
penitentiary, you get a medal.
The bank gets us Papi.
And that's all that matters,
right?
It takes whatever it takes,
baby.
Did you ever really love me?
Hmm?
I really meant to love you.
Shit.
You don't have to knock, you
know. It's always open.
Yeah, good.
Let's hit the bank.
Let's hit the bank.
The Tres Cruces?
That's correct.
Oh, shit.
Here I am still spinning about
how we got yanked out of line...
at the border.
So, you in, or you out?
I am in, yeah.
It's just...
have you ever had anything like
that happen to you before?
I mean, they were 100% convinced
we were holding.
And we would have, if Papi hadn't
welched on that coke.
So, you're saying that to say
what?
I am saying it's only because
you're hearing it.
No, you saying something.
And if you saying it, I am
hearing it...
cause you're saying it. What are
you saying? Let it be said.
Oh, I think you're fucking playing
me.
You want to be played?
I have been at your hip for
ten months...
but after this, I think maybe
you're playing me.
I got you.
No, you didn't.
Oh, I did. The corner of your
eye was twitching.
The corner?
That wasn't a twitch.
That was a wink.
That's my move.
Yup, that's Papi's chubby
little kid, right there.
Feed that motherfucker
quesadillas...
Oh, my God.
She's chubby, too.
In all the right places.
How does an old, fat, ugly fuck
get a girl like that?
Money.
All right, here we go.
Same thing every two weeks.
Papi flies over the border with
a briefcase full of cash.
He spends a week with the
mistress.
Ferret Nose Julio drives it
out...
to the Tres Cruces "Savings
and Loan."
Think they got three million
in the bank, huh?
Easy.
Bingo.
Money, money, money, money.
Oh, yeah.
Why don't you hit the diner
and check out the doughnuts?
I am kind of more in a corned
beef hash mood...
to tell you the truth.
You never heard the saying...
"Never rob a bank across from
a diner...
that has the best doughnuts,
in three counties?"
That's not a saying.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
I get what you're saying...
You never heard it?
but it's not a saying.
It is a saying.
Okay. It's a saying now.
Let you tell it.
Make the move.
Bad DEA agent.
Am I bad?
Yes, you are.
I am a bad girl?
Yes, you are.
Stig decided to hit the bank
tomorrow, 3:00.
Stig decided?
Well, with or without me, he's
going in.
Well, I still haven't talked
to Jessup.
Stig doesn't know that.
3:00 tomorrow he's going in.
If we want Papi, I got to go
in with him.
You're not even going to give
me a choice, are you?
I am giving you no other options
as a way to protect you.
Just have the troops meet me
outside the bank...
3:05 when we come out.
3:05.
Okay.
And don't shoot me.
Even if you want to.
We will see.
License and registration,
cowboy.
Cute.
What's up, Teemo?
What's up, brother?
How are you, brother?
Missed you, man.
Missed you, man.
Got you a turkey burger.
Special sauce.
Commander wants to see you.
Yes, sir.
So, half a mile from home.
I got Bobby all wound up and
ready to go, sir.
Ordnance you requested.
Do you know, the Admiral's proud
of what you have done.
You have gone way out on a limb.
If the bank falls right tomorrow...
he says you can come in from
the cold, rejoin your brothers.
Great. Be good just to put the
uniform back on, sir.
I didn't join the Navy to commit
felonies and hang with drug dealers.
Even if you're damn good at it?
I do what I do for the Navy, sir.
It's all part of the Admiral's
plan.
We get this three million from
the bank...
we run cross-border ops on Papi
and all the other cartels.
So, tomorrow, clean and precise.
Tick all the boxes, nothing
left undone. You got it?
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Hey, nice jacket.
Hey, tell your mother, she's
got to move out of my house...
at some point, man.
All right, what do you want,
clown, or Frankie?
Frankie.
So, what'd you do with the .22?
Traded to my cousin for an
espresso machine.
You're going to need special
beans for that, right?
Uh, uh, uh.
You can reach for your firearm,
but do it real slow.
Any other people in the building?
What the hell is this?
It's a bank robbery...
only instead of robbing the bank
and letting you chase after us...
we decided to come after you,
first.
Let's go.
All right, give me your gun,
there.
All right, everybody sit down.
Everybody sit down on the floor.
Ladies behind the counter, keep
your hands visible...
not on the alarms, okay?
Let's go, let's go!
It's all right, girls.
Just give them the drawer cash.
Did we ask for the drawer cash?
Come on, come on, come on.
Sit right here. Sit, sit.
Let's go, on the floor.
Hey, guard.
Hey. Hey.
Look, I am trying to be polite,
all right?
Just sit tight and this will
be over soon.
Open the gate.
I don't have a key.
What'd you say?
Easy.
You lie to me again, it's going
to be more than a fucking problem.
Get out there, now.
Get on the floor.
You good?
I am going in.
Shh.
It's all right.
Oh, Timothy.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Okay.
Here you go.
Showtime.
Fire in the hole.
Holy shit.
Hey, Frankie, something's not
right.
They're all stuffed with money.
I thought you said there would
only be one or two.
Every single one of them.
I am at 32 boxes and counting.
Look, there's way more than
three million.
And there's still a lot more,
here.
All right, well, take them all.
We will figure it out later.
You go ahead, I will get
the rest.
All right.
Listen.
May be gunfire outside, okay?
So, if it hits, you get everybody
behind the counters.
This is for the jail, across
the street.
You let the cops out.
Let them out.
Come on.
That is a hell of a lot more
than $3 million.
How much, you figure?
We couldn't be the luckiest chumps
on the face of the Earth, could we?
You feel lucky?
No, I don't.
I mean, this can't be Papi's
money.
I mean money like this, people
are going to chase us...
off the end of the earth for
money like this.
Well, I hate to tell you this,
Stig...
but I got more bad news for...
You take that hand away nice
and slow, Bobby.
Okay.
Put the gun down, Stig.
You know I really like you,
right?
I like you, too.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't. Nobody likes me,
okay? And I am okay with it.
I do.
I like you more than most.
You're not just saying it...
cause I got a gun pointed to
you?
Why don't you just put the
gun down?
Shit.
Oh.
Hot-dogging!
I am sorry, man.
What'd you do that, for?
Shit, man, I had to.
No, you didn't.
It's just a little flesh wound.
Okay. You're going to be alright.
Drink the water, and then you
will be able...
What is that?
In your hand.
Is that a badge in your hand?
Tell me you're not a no-good,
two-timing son of a bitch.
Two-timing?
Tell me!
You shot me.
DEA...
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, man. Hang on.
No, you wait a minute.
Hey, Stig...
Hey...
The United States is the greatest
country in the world...
because we accept a man is, at
his core...
greedy...
selfish...
and covetous.
I had no choice.
They took my key.
I would never willingly open
the vault.
Keep your hands on the desk,
please.
In America, we line everybody up.
Say, "You're on your own."
"Grab all you can grab."
I am innocent.
Nobody's innocent, friend.
There's just the guilty...
the ignorant...
and the unlucky.
Did you take our money?
You fellas look like you're
waiting for a bus.
You guys let us know when
you're done.
Oh, I am done, and thank you
for the courtesy.
Who is that guy?
You heard of the hidden hand
of God?
Well, that's God's son-of-a-bitch.
Call the DDO and get a list of
everyone who knew...
we had money in this bank.
You two realize those sunglasses
make you look like assholes.
Excuse me, when'd that diner
burn?
Yesterday.
I want interviews with the wait
staff...
and every customer in the place.
It was just a grease fire.
Did I ask your opinion, Gomer?
You ever hear the saying...
"Never rob a bank across from
a diner...
with the best doughnuts, in
three counties?"
If that diner fire's a
coincidence...
it's only because we ain't
looking hard enough.
That is an impressive amount
of greenbacks.
43,125,000 of them, sir.
Mmm.
Recount it. Pack it up.
We will stow it back in Corpus.
It was my impression we were
supposed to come out...
of that bank with three million
at most, sir.
Mmm-hmm.
Whose money was it?
Bad men, unworthy of it.
Did you know Bobby Beans was DEA?
No, I didn't.
No offense sir, but you really
need to work...
on your surprised face.
Well, if he was DEA, he helped
you rob a bank.
Which means he's dirty, and for
that, I have no mercy.
Where'd you leave him?
In the desert.
Is he dead?
More than likely.
"More than likely."
You want to tell me what that
means?
The whole point of you working
with Bobby Beans...
was to kill him off and create
a cut-out...
so, the op couldn't get traced
back to us.
My cover's solid. There's no
way it...
will trace back.
What?
My cover is solid. There's no
way it will trace back, sir.
That's a call made above your
pay grade.
Yes, sir.
Assign two of the boys to stow
the money back at the naval base.
The rest will come with us, to
check on the body of Mr. Beans.
Stigman, want to come with me?
Hey there, buddy.
Hey.
You habla?
Yeah, yeah.
I, uh... I hablo.
Okay, that's good.
Don't trust in him until you
see his papers.
If he's got papers, I'll see his
papers. You got papers, right?
No.
No, I got no papers.
Well, that's going to be a
problem.
See, Slim Jay and me, we done
assigned ourselves...
protection, this here stretch
of the border.
Officially, unofficially.
So, we really going to have
to see your papers.
Make sure you ain't no Muslim,
or nothing.
Well... oh, yeah.
No, I do have it.
Salaam aaleikum.
And, let me have your gun.
Give it to me.
Gracias.
You know how to pray?
Teemo.
How we doing, boys?
Any sign of Bobby Beans?
Checked all the washes to the
southeast.
No sign of a body.
All right.
Well, Stig, you put us in quite
a hole.
I don't see it that way, sir...
but you're the man with the oak
leaves.
All that pride I had in you.
That loyalty?
You just tossed it to the wind.
Yes, sir.
I am sorry, sir.
Goddamn it.
He's in the wash!
Go, go, go!
Come on, let's flush him out!
Where you going, Stigman?
It doesn't matter if you run.
Your jacket's wired, so, you're
six months AWOL...
after stabbing an MP.
You talk to anyone, they're
just going to hand you...
right back over to me.
You all right?
Yeah.
Then get your ass, up!
Toss the gun.
Fuck...
Move!
Come on, come on!
Damn it!
Jesus! What am I supposed to
do with this?
Aw, man.
Aw.
Come on.
I am a vet, not a trauma surgeon.
I can't help you with this, man.
You got to go.
Go where?
Just... you got to leave.
I can't do anything.
Kenny, you remember a couple
of months ago...
you offered to sell me 500 hits
of ketamine?
Yeah, you said you weren't
interested.
Right.
Because I am a DEA agent.
And if you don't fix me up...
I am going to go to the DEA...
I am going to tell them that you
like cruising Tori Amos concerts...
selling Special K to little
weepy college girls.
There's no way you're a cop.
No?
No.
You sure?
I am positive.
You have the right to remain
silent.
You have the right to have a
lawyer present...
during questioning.
Do I need to keep going?
No, I am good.
You're a cop.
Okay.
Okay.
Nice shirt.
Thanks.
It's JC Penney's.
Yeah?
Yeah.
All right, hold on one second.
Welcome to the Camino Real.
Thank you.
Hey.
You were late.
Jesus Christ.
What the hell happened?
Excuse us.
Excuse me.
I robbed a bank.
What happened to you?
I was there with six agents at 3:05.
No, you weren't.
Yes, I was.
You were late.
You went early.
And it's not as if you couldn't
have pulled your badge...
at any time and stopped it.
I did. Stig shot me.
What?
He shot me in the shoulder.
We got to take you to the
hospital.
And interrupt your rendezvous
with Harvey? I don't think so.
This is what we need to do...
we need to find Stig, we need
to find the money.
All right.
Listen.
Let me go upstairs, make my
excuses...
and then we will find Stig
together, okay?
Okay, let's do this.
Let's do this.
Why don't you recheck Stig's
background?
Maybe there was something
that we missed. All right?
I am going to Stig's apartment
and see what I can find out.
All right?
Okay.
Tell Harvey I said hi.
Who'd you patch up?
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
Well, there's a dune buggy
parked out back...
that was stolen by a man with
a bullet hole in him.
Now, before he had a bullet
hole in him...
he burned down a diner and
robbed a bank.
I don't know anything about
that, so...
Okay.
Okay?
Fair enough.
Say, let me ask you something.
You ever play Russian roulette?
Of course not.
What am I thinking?
The thing is, most people...
they put the gun to the temple.
And that's, well, that's just
stupid.
What if...
the bullet's in the first
chamber?
You blow a man's head off
before he's had a chance...
to tell you what you want
to know.
No. No, no.
Come on, man.
Case in point.
Stig.
Stig.
Pick up, Bobby.
What the fuck are you doing
here, Bobby?
What're you ducking for, man?
You know I set you up, right?
They told me all about you.
Tough cat. Knows everybody.
Doesn't have people.
That guy? Well, shit, that
guy's a perfect cut-out.
I mean, he takes a bullet,
who's going to care, right?
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the damn phone, Bobby.
You got anything to say?
First question...
if you're DEA and you're clean,
why are you here alone?
Where's your back-up, Bobby?
Come on, Bobby, it's this kind
of attitude...
makes me think you're not one
of the good guys.
If I wanted you, I could have
had you...
before you walked into that
building, Bobby.
That's a beautiful rifle, Stig.
Is that Army issue?
You'd like that? No, it's K-Mart.
Blue Light Special.
Now, answer my question.
Where's your back-up?
No, no, that's a military rifle.
What's the military doing
robbing banks, Stig?
Can we just have a straight-up
conversation, Bobby?
I got you dead to rights.
Yeah?
So, shoot me.
Again.
No?
I will shoot myself.
Huh.
Not bad.
I am glad you're impressed.
Were you testing me to see
if I would shoot first?
Where's the money, Stig?
You know, if I thought you were
clean, I might tell you...
but I don't, so, I can't.
You're lying. You don't have it,
do you? Where's the money?
Oh, shit.
What?
You're not the only one I was
expecting, Bobby.
Three very nasty men just
showed up.
If they find you in my place,
they will get ugly.
Who are they?
Yesterday I'd have said they
were my family.
Today, they kind of want to
kill me.
I understand the feeling.
You know, fuck you.
What do you know about family?
You don't even have people.
No, Bobby, that's a stupid idea.
They're already coming up
the stairs.
Bobby.
I told you.
Now, Bobby...
hang up the speaker and answer
your cell phone, okay?
If you want me to help you out.
Listen...
Yeah.
Just stay in the shadows, okay?
I am going to guide you out
from there.
Wait.
Wait.
He's coming up your rear.
You better dart across the hall.
Go over to the bedroom and
hide behind the lockers.
Go!
All right, Bobby, you're going to
want to scoot across the hall. Go!
Bobby, Bob...
Shit.
Teemo!
Rooftop.
Target's on the move.
Sorry, Teemo.
Where's our money?
I have no idea what you're
talking about.
You think DEA can just waltz
into our bank...
steal our money, and we're not
going to kick?
Your man Bobby Trench stole
43 million of our dollars.
We'd like it back.
Because it's our money.
Because it's a blatant act
of disrespect.
And because it's our money.
Please tell me it's you, Bobby.
Anything new on Stig?
He's coming up clean on every
database I am cleared for.
No military connection?
No record of service?
To go deeper, I'd need to get
clearance from Jessup.
Well, try your old contacts in
the military.
I am going to tell Jessup
everything I know.
Wait, are you sure?
Someone has to know whose money
was in the bank.
Yeah.
Stig.
Stig didn't even know I was DEA.
Besides, somebody tried to
kill him, too.
Bobby, let me help you.
What do you need?
Take it easy.
Bye.
Bobby.
Fuck.
That's how you take down a man.
Now, shut the door.
Just let it come.
Agent Robert Lynn Trench.
Aka Bobby T, aka Bobby B, aka
Bobby Beans.
Let's have a chat.
You stole $43.125 million...
that did not belong to you.
Now, man-to-man...
who at DEA authorized you to
rob our bank?
You a banker?
You ever play Russian roulette?
Thing is...
most people put the gun to
the temple.
Well, that's just stupid.
You blow a man's head off before
he's had a chance...
to tell you what you want
to know.
Mess up your suit, too.
Who told you it was all right
to take our money?
Our money.
Our bank.
Who are you?
If you don't know who I am...
how did you know to steal our
forty-three million?
I don't know what you're
talking about.
You don't?
No.
Well...
Where's the money?
Oh, boy.
Well, uh...
it ain't down there, I can
guarantee you that.
Whoa-hoo!
Aka, Bobby Balls.
Clean and shaven.
You know what you are?
You...
are a dirty DEA agent.
That's right.
You're a dirty DEA agent who
robbed a bank.
And shot your boss.
You walk into any federal office...
and that's the story they're
going to have.
Unless you bring me $43.125
million...
and you walk away.
Clean.
Have I properly incentivized
you?
More than you know.
Unless you want to rot in jail,
you best get after it.
Go on, now.
Go on.
All right.
You're thinking he deserved
better?
You're right.
Hey, Rudy.
Hola, Javier.
Morning, Papi.
Don't move.
Go inside, quick.
Mommy.
Whose money did we steal?
You really want to know?
I really want to know.
Easy, old man, get in there.
Get in there.
Payback's a bitch.
Payback's a bitch.
Uh, uh, uh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Bobby.
Drop the gun. Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
Nice and easy.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Well, I got him first. I got dibs.
I got a .44. I am taking Papi.
Give me the keys.
You want them?
Come get them.
Now, I see the wheels turning.
You're thinking a little blindfold,
maybe use your teeth.
That's not what I am thinking.
You know what I am thinking?
What?
Oh, shit, man!
How's that?
That was uncalled for.
Shit. You know, I liked you
better when you were...
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby, and that
Bobby was a good guy.
Yeah, well, I liked you better
when you were...
winking at waitresses...
and shooting the heads off
of chickens.
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys!
Shit.
What's going on?
You saw that move coming?
That's correct. Give me the keys.
Damn, you're good.
Now, one of us is going to
have to pick up those keys.
Guess. All right.
I will get them, all right?
Get them, get them.
Put that musket away, man.
Hey, pull over.
Pull over?
Hey Papi, you like my driving?
Oh, shit.
Come on, Bobby, I ain't got
all damn day.
What do you want to do?
Ow.
All right. All right, all right.
All right, let me go.
You let me go first.
No, you let me go.
On three.
On three.
One...
Yeah?
two... three.
See? Now you're making me not
be able to trust you.
Alright. On the count of three,
we will let each other go.
All right?
All right. That's fair.
One... two...
three.
I knew it.
Let me go.
No!
Alright...
I'm gonna let you go, I'm
gonna let you go.
All right.
One...
Ow!
Ow.
Come on, man. You got to admit,
that was kind of fun, no?
You didn't like that?
Who are you?
Shit.
Huh?
U.S. Navy Intel.
Yeah?
Or, I was.
My commander FUBARed my jacket.
And now I am AWOL, after stabbing
an MP.
You're lucky. They got me framed
for killing my boss.
Did your boss order your four
closest friends to kill you?
Nah, you got me there.
Petty Officer Michael Stigman.
DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but
I guess you know that, already.
Pleasure.
So, what...
you just happened to pick me,
or...
you got orders to set me up
on purpose?
I had orders, man.
I didn't know you were DEA.
My people did.
But they're Intel...
there's not much they don't
know.
Your people?
Now I am just trying to piece
together the truth...
so I can take it over my
commander's head to the Admiral.
That's why they want to kill me
and why I want to talk to Papi.
Right.
Well...
I guess we can both talk to
him, at the same time.
What, like we're working
together?
No, not like we're working together.
Yeah!
No, like we're working in the
same vicinity.
Together.
In the same area code.
Together.
The same county.
And don't get all "We Are The
World" on me, either.
When this is over, I am still
going to shoot you.
But we're partners.
Come on man, ebony and ivory.
Shit, I think he puked.
He's puked, or he's dead.
Oh, yeah, he puked.
Hey.
I am going to fucking kill
you both.
This might take a while.
I got all day, partner.
Hold on.
Let me put that in there with
you. Put that on you.
So, partner, how you want to
do this?
I like that, it's got a nice
roll off your tongue, there.
Partner, we're not that close.
Don't kumbaya with me.
Don't kumbaya.
Hey.
I am going to get my bucket and
towel, and waterboard his ass.
No, we got to give him a chance
to talk.
You got anything to say?
I hope you guys like the taste
of balls...
because I am going to chop yours
off, stuff them in your mouths.
See?
Or maybe I will put yours in
his, and his in yours.
Want me to get the bucket?
Kumbaya.
So, why were you putting so much
money in Tres Cruces?
It's Tres Cruces.
We thought you just stashed a
little cash there until we...
robbed the place, found forty
million. Why is that?
You robbed Tres Cruces?
That's correct.
Why is that?
That's funny, huh?
You're dead.
Yeah, that is funny, isn't it?
You're both dead.
And I didn't even have to
kill you.
I thought you were sharp.
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.
But you...
You just ripped off the CIA.
The CIA?
The CIA.
He's full of crap.
Why would he have money in the
same bank as the CIA?
Why would you have money in
the same bank as the CIA?
I don't have shit in that bank.
The only money I deliver to
Tres Cruces...
is a payment.
To the CIA?
The CIA.
They take 7% of my revenue.
In return, they let me use
their planes...
so I can get my shit across
the border.
I could do it a lot cheaper, but
there was really no negotiations.
You know...
they take it from all the cartels.
Bullshit.
Okay.
They're still going to kill you.
Bobby?
You said stop by anytime.
You kidnapped a drug kingpin.
That's correct.
Papi Greco. And you tied him
up in my garage.
Sorry.
What do you...
You mind if I swipe a yogurt?
Yeah, sure.
Please...
help yourself to anything.
Take whatever you want.
It's just a yogurt.
But it's her yogurt.
Just put it back.
Please.
Are you two like ex-boyfriend
and girlfriend?
Actually, you know what?
We never put a name on it.
So, what, you broke his heart,
or he broke yours?
Wow, this guy will really ask
anyone...
Why don't you go and check...
anything at anytime.
on Papi, huh?
What do you see in this guy?
I could go on for hours, but
I don't know you...
and I don't think this is the
right time for us to...
have this conversation, okay?
Stig.
So, daddy issues, huh?
Daddy!
Is he serious?
Garage... Papi... go!
I knew it. Hi, daddy.
I get it now.
Go. Go to the garage.
Can I have the yogurt?
You can have the yogurt. Here.
I don't like her, man.
Well, you don't get a vote.
I am going to watch her.
Bobby... what are you doing?
Are you 100% sure you can trust
this guy?
No.
But he's all the help I got.
Jessup's dead.
The money we stole was CIA money.
They came looking for it.
I am sorry, Deb, I didn't mean to
get you involved in all this.
You okay?
What are you smirking at?
You know, I have been racking
my brain...
trying to figure out who you
look like.
And it finally dawned on me.
You look like a Mexican Albert
Einstein.
Minus the genius factor, obviously.
You want some yogurt?
Payback's a bitch.
That's for Little Toro.
Stig.
Stig.
Pack it up.
Move it, move it.
Stig.
The one and only.
That your people?
Do you have to say it like that?
Like what?
They're your people, right?
Technically, yes, but I thought
you were my people now.
All right, two taps, we will
hit the garage. On go.
Okay, on your go.
Go.
Fuck.
What was that about?
That was messed up.
What the hell is going on?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Give me your phone, now.
I will take the car, too.
Get out. Get out.
Oh, my God.
Esta en un gray Charger.
How did Stig's people know
to come to your house?
I don't know.
They must have followed you.
I don't think so.
We would have seen them.
Should have seen them.
How'd they know to come to
your house?
Hmm?
Why were they at your house,
Debbie?
Oh, no.
You serious?
Bobby...
Out of the car, gabacho.
Hurry up.
You fucked up now, ese.
On your knees.
I know some guys, too, Bobby.
Bag them up.
Let's take them home.
Do you want to talk about it?
No.
You sure?
Yeah, I am sure.
I told you I didn't like her,
man.
Shut up.
What are you getting mad at
me, for?
Because you talk too much.
What'd I ever do to you?
Besides shoot me?
You know what you are?
You're a misanthorpe.
It's misanthrope.
I am a misanthrope.
Did you know what I meant
to say?
No.
What did you mean to say?
That you don't like people.
Shut up.
Time for my massage.
Yeah. I will have housekeeping
clean up your bed.
Oh, shit.
My grandfather cut cane for
thirty years, every day...
and never got a blister.
Says it smells like hell...
toughens the hands.
You know what I like about this?
Not only do I get to take my
time with you guys...
but this time, I don't have to
worry about leaving any marks.
Don't put your hands on me, man.
Shit.
What did you say?
Just don't put those pissy
hands on me, man.
You ain't got a home, Bobby.
DEA doesn't want you around.
Not with your sins.
Payback's a bitch.
You smell like warm Corona, man.
You remember my prize breeding
bull.
With cojones the size of coconuts.
You want to see him?
No, it's okay.
We can see good from here.
Adios, Bobby.
No, no.
Shit.
$43 million.
It's everything we stole from
the CIA.
You let us go, we will bring
it to you.
I got the money.
What are you talking about?
I got it.
You don't have it.
I know I don't have it.
He doesn't know that.
But you don't have the money.
I know you don't have it,
cause I have it.
You have it?
Well, where is it?
Commander Quince's safe.
Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.
Don't tell me. Tell him.
Oh, shit.
Where is it?
Commander Quince's safe.
Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.
The guy's pissing on us...
and you're asking if we should
fucking tell him.
If that's the truth, I might
as well just kill you now.
I had a run-in with a couple
boys out of your organization.
Hello, Earl.
Mr. Bobby Beans and Mr. Michael
Stigman.
Well, they're not from my
organization.
They're freelancers.
And Bobby Beans is undercover
DEA.
And Mr. Stigman's AWOL U.S. Navy.
They stole $43.125 million
from the Tres Cruces.
We want it back.
Is there a finder's fee?
Fee is we let you continue to
do business.
Fee is we don't raise our cut
from 7% to 20%.
The fee is we don't come down
here with a squad of...
Apache A-6 helicopters...
and wipe you off the face of
the Earth.
You like my country weak and
corrupt, don't you?
So you can buy your cheap crap
at the mall.
Well, Earl, I am not cheap.
Is this about pride, Manny?
About machismo?
Prove you got a big Mexican
cock?
Well, your cock is huge.
It's massive.
And I, I'm in awe of your cock.
So, what?
You're still a drug dealer.
And I am still the government
of the United States.
It's a free market, Manny.
Not a free world.
I'll take a look.
Hard.
You look hard.
Under every rock in Mexico.
Let's get out of this shithole.
I've decided to let you bring me
the forty-three million.
The truck will take you north
to the border.
From there, you will cross on
foot with the coyotes.
If it's all the same, we'd
rather drive.
With everybody looking for you...
they'd pull you out of line
in two seconds.
No, you go the way you force
my people.
If we can't risk crossing...
how are we supposed to bring
you back the money?
I will meet you north of the
border, in twenty-four hours.
Now, I am trusting you to fulfill
your part of the bargain.
Hey, Bobby.
You got twenty-four hours to
bring me the money.
Or I am going to shoot her
right in the head.
Then I am going to find you...
and I am going to gut you
like a pig.
Stig.
When this is over, I am still
going to shoot you.
Whatever it takes, Bobby.
Pick one.
I can get in anything.
So, what about the Audi?
No, no, I don't do German, okay?
Locks are tricky, too many alarms.
Okay, okay.
Suburban?
That one's 2010.
It's going to get like two
miles a gallon.
I ain't paying for all that gas.
You know for a car thief, you
are mighty particular.
I will break into the Honda.
I look like I am going to ride
in that Honda to you?
Oh, you could.
And you could pick something
with a little more... class.
Well, I hate to remind you...
but we're breaking onto a high
security Navy base, okay?
We ain't going to the hip-hop
opera.
It ain't no Les Miserables for
you, tonight.
Les Miserables.
Oh, man, whatever the fuck, man.
Don't remind me.
Look, it's not my fault Quince
took the money back to the base.
I thought you said you took the
money back to the base.
No, I never said that.
So, the money could be anywhere.
It could be in East Jabip,
the Cayman Islands...
No, the money is on the base,
okay?
I gave it to Commander Quince
at the Camino Real...
and he told the guys to take
it back to the base.
Right before he took you out
and tried to kill you.
That doesn't mean he's lying
about the base.
Not everybody's as paranoid
as you, Bobby. Jeez.
What about the Prius?
You like the Prius?
Camino Real.
Yeah, it's a hotel.
I met Debbie at the Camino Real.
No shit?
Yeah.
What was she doing there?
She said she was there to meet
her boyfriend, Harvey.
Wait. Your girlfriend has a
boyfriend?
She's not my girlfriend.
Holy shit.
Yeah, just pick a car.
Right here.
You picked that one?
Yeah.
Fuck you want, a fucking Bentley?
I got it.
Hi.
Hey.
Crazy question...
you wouldn't have anybody knows
how to fix a snowmobile?
I don't think so.
Would you check for me?
I really need it fixed by tonight.
Why, a big storm coming?
You never can be too sure.
I will be right back.
Up with that?
What?
She smiled at you, you didn't
wink at her?
I don't wink at every woman
I see.
Snowmobile in Texas, huh?
You must be in some serious
shit, sailor.
You got yourself a new claw,
huh?
Give me a claw. Give it a pound.
It's a beaut.
You still got my rainy-day stash?
Yeah.
See you later, Stig.
All right.
You know what they say, talk
softly and carry an M-4...
with a grenade launcher.
Wow.
Which one you want?
This one.
What's your plan for getting
on the base?
I am working on it.
Alright.
Remember, once we get to the
command building...
Quince's office is first floor,
end of the hall.
If he's not in the field, that's
where he lives 18 hours a day.
Right, right.
But you still haven't told me...
what the plan is to get through
the gate.
I got a plan. I mean, I'm capable
of coming up...
with a plan.
I'm not saying you're not capable...
I am just saying you haven't
told me. What is it?
I am working on it.
Better work faster.
Much faster.
Move it up.
Quickly!
Oh, fuck it.
Halt.
He's going through.
That fast enough for you?
Shit.
Let's go. Let's go.
On the radio, now!
That was your plan?
Well, we're on the base,
aren't we?
That's not a plan.
Nobody in their right mind
breaks into a naval base.
That's why it's a brilliant plan.
No one expected it.
You should have seen your face.
Damn, they were surprised.
Your stop coming up.
I will play decoy...
lead them away, try to get to
the Admiral, okay?
All right.
Things go wrong, I'll see you
back at the boat yard.
Things ain't going wrong.
I am getting a medal.
I get to the Admiral, I am
getting a medal. Watch.
You're going to wish me luck,
aren't you?
Come on, man, let's hear it.
Good luck.
Quince's office at the end of
the hall.
Remember, first floor, end of
the hall.
Halt.
Stop where you are.
We have a breach at Status Hall.
Go, go, go, go.
Up the stairs.
Sir, Petty Officer Michael
Stigman, ID number 540333.
Wait a minute, what's the problem?
Shit, I am sorry. I didn't mean
to do that to you, man.
Sir?
I have been in service twelve
years, sir.
I've never stepped foot in an
officers' mess...
much less, crashed it.
Please, sir, it's an emergency.
Stand outside, please.
Leave us alone.
Thank you, sir.
Hey, I am really sorry about
that, man.
I didn't mean to hit you
like that. I apologize.
I am listening, sailor.
Sit.
Thank you, sir.
Try the Admiral again for me.
Yes, sir.
And you believed this stolen
money...
would all be used to fight
drug cartels?
Yes, sir.
I thought the orders came down
the valid chain of command.
Blind loyalty is not loyalty.
I know that, sir, and that's
why I am here.
Well, you have shown a lot of
tenacity and a lot of guts...
bringing this to me.
Thank you, sir. That means the
world, coming from you.
Unfortunately, there's nothing
I can do for you.
Well, of course, sir. I mean, you
can just lock down the base.
You can arrest Commander Quince.
The United States Navy does not
rob banks.
Its personnel did not rob
a bank.
I am not going to tarnish the
integrity of the Navy...
over one crooked sailor.
If there was money taken from
the bank...
that was part of an illegal
CIA slush fund...
the Navy had no knowledge the
fund existed.
Your jacket has you six months
AWOL?
Yes, sir.
It's going to stay that way.
Commander Quince's jacket will
likewise be amended...
so, he's also AWOL...
making none of this the Navy's
problem.
Sir, this isn't right.
Well, I'd offer more...
but when the hand has gangrene...
you chop it off to save the body.
You don't keep the pinkie around,
just because it meant well.
Have Petty Officer Stigman dropped
outside the main gate.
He sets foot on a military base
anywhere in the world...
I want him shot.
This is bullshit.
You know, men like me fight and
die on the orders of men like you.
Without us, those stars on your
shoulder are a fucking costume.
Open the safe.
Does your boss know you're
doing this?
Open it.
Or did the CIA kill her like
they did Jessup?
What's it to you?
I don't like loose ends.
Neither do I...
Harvey.
Huh?
Well, my mother named me Harold.
I like Harvey.
Harvey has a nice ring, to it.
Don't you like "Harvey?"
I don't know what you're talking
about.
Yes, you do. Been to the Camino
Real Hotel, lately?
Open the safe.
Staging area cleared up.
Bring it through.
Where's the money?
You tell me where Deb is.
She's getting her nails done.
Where is the money?
I don't know.
All right, tell me what you
do know.
Well, your girl found out where
the CIA...
was stashing the money, right
about when I did.
And when I told her...
that she and I could get away
with the money...
by setting you and Stigman up...
she didn't even blink.
Don't lie to me.
Was she that unhappy, Bobby?
Where is the money?
Don't lie to me.
You think I'd keep it here with
you and Stigman still alive?
Come on, Bobby.
You gave it to her, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Commander.
Back up.
Go, go, go, go.
On your six.
Move, move, move.
All personnel, evacuate the
building.
All personnel, evacuate the
building.
Take the back, in that alley.
Go to the front.
Let's go.
Hey.
This way.
Move.
Come on, come on.
Find him.
Clear.
Clear.
You okay?
Come on, let's go.
You okay, sir?
Yeah, I am fine.
Work off the standpipe.
This is really good barbecue.
You don't want to regret not
trying it.
Why don't you stop wasting my
time and just kill me?
Even if Bobby was coming with
the money...
you'd still kill us both.
But he's not coming.
He will be here.
No.
He won't.
You think he's just going to
let you die?
You think it was a coincidence
the Navy came looking for Bobby...
at my house?
If I couldn't have Bobby, at least
I'd have half of 43 million.
You set up Bobby Beans.
I wouldn't be coming for you,
either.
Where's the money?
Come on.
I don't know.
Gone, out of the country.
It's certainly not on a Navy
base, Papi.
Where does that leave you?
Exactly where I deserve to be.
Yeah.
Bobby.
You're late.
I got the money.
I don't believe you.
No, I got it.
Believe me, I got it.
I will bring it to you.
Where are you?
Hi, Bobby.
Debbie?
Can he hear us?
Just hang up the phone and run.
Okay, listen to me.
Tell him I got the money.
Hang up the phone.
It's not your fault.
Just...
Debbie?
Tell him I have the money.
Okay?
And I know you know where the
money is.
Just tell him I have it.
Debbie, listen to me.
I am sorry.
I really meant to love you.
Debbie.
Where are you?
Debbie, where are you?
Where are you?
Debbie?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Debbie? Uh...
Wait a minute, I got the money.
What'd they say?
What'd the Admiral say?
What'd the Admiral say?
Admiral washed his hands...
of the whole thing.
Navy turned their back.
Where's the money?
There was no money, Stig.
What?
There was no money.
Of course there is.
I gave Quince the money.
Right, and Quince gave it to
Deb, and Deb is dead.
Papi killed her.
Fuck him.
Let's go down to Mexico.
We will lure them all down, then
take every one of them out.
I'll kill them all.
And then what?
Well, at least Quince and
Papi'd be dead.
And then what?
Oh, you just want to let them
skate?
You don't get it, do you, Stig?
I mean, God bless you, you still
think there's some kind of code.
There is no code.
You followed every order the
Navy gave you and...
they kicked you in the teeth.
There is no code, Stig.
No one fights for the Navy, okay?
It's not about the Navy.
You fight for the guy that's
fighting next to you.
That doesn't mean anything
to you?
I am going to Mexico.
And just so you know, my code,
my code saved your life.
There's three inches between
your heart and your shoulder.
My bullet goes three inches left,
you'd be dead.
And I wouldn't be here.
Because Quince only decided to
kill me, because I let you live.
What, you think I missed, huh?
Is that what you think?
You think I missed?
When have you ever seen me miss?
You stay here.
I am going to Mexico.
Our deal still stand?
I give you the money, I walk
away clean?
Hola! Looks like you had a
(inaudible) morning.
You better have my money.
Right here.
Every penny.
Where's Bobby?
Ah, we had a philosophical
falling out.
Open your trunk.
I just want your word, okay,
that you and your boys...
Ferret Nose Julio, all of y'all...
help me kill Commander Quince.
Who's Commander Quince?
That's him.
Mr. Stigman, you promised me
$43 million...
for killing everyone on this
ranch.
Got the money right here, sir.
Thing is, I promised Papi the
$43 million, too...
so, I am afraid you two are
going to have to duke it out.
Maybe he and I will just kill
you instead...
and split the money.
What'd you say, Papi?
50% of 40 million?
Better than 100% dead, right?
He'll double-cross you.
Minute your back is turned,
bullet in the head.
50-50.
The guy up on the roof says
60-40.
He ain't got a trustworthy bone
in his body.
I came back, didn't I?
Fucking CIA.
Red rover, red rover!
Whoever's got my 43.125 million,
better come the-fuck-on, out.
You offer him the money, too?
I didn't call him.
It's in the trunk.
Why the fuck did you tell him
that?
Thank you, Commander.
Mr. Stigman, come on out and
open the trunk.
Nice and slow, now.
Well, what do we got here?
Sounds like a Mexican wedding.
Is that my '64 Impala?
That's correct.
I told you.
I know a guy.
Now...
who wants to see $43 million?
For a minute there, I thought
you had me chasing my tail.
You want to count it?
Oh, if you're shorting me, I know
where to find you.
So, we're good?
Did I not give you my word?
That's right.
Then don't treat me like
an asshole.
I will try my best.
You and Mr. Stigman are free
to go.
Yes, sir.
I trust you can find your own
way home?
That's right.
What're you doing, Bobby?
Let's go.
I am not going to let him get
away with the money.
Let's go.
I hate these doggone teeth.
They're not just going to let
us go.
I got a plan.
Hey, I got my M-16.
I got my grenade launcher, I
got my M-4. Let's do this shit.
I got a plan. I am capable of
coming up with a plan.
Well, it better be a goddamn
good one.
It's a good plan.
Make it rain.
That was your plan?
To blow up $43 million?
Yeah, that's why it's a
brilliant plan.
Nobody expected it.
Go.
Come on, move it.
Dumb assholes.
Move it.
You coming?
Go ahead, I will be right
behind you.
Don't miss.
I never miss.
Told you.
Stig.
Stig!
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Playtime's over.
No more fucking around.
Now...
drop your weapon.
Tell Mr. Stigman to do the same.
You tell him.
It's real simple.
We can all make a deal, or we
can all die.
I am not making any deals.
Talk to your man, Bobby.
Be the smart one.
You think Tres Cruces is the
only stash we got?
We got twenty more.
We got money everywhere.
You're not going to change
a damn thing.
Stig?
Yeah?
You're my people, right?
That's correct.
You good?
Never better.
We're not people, though.
This makes us family.
All right, brother.
Hey, senior Einstein, you're
looking kind of fucked up...
sitting there, man.
You all right?
Mow my lawn.
Adios, puto.
Well, you know what was so cool?
What?
You rolling in on that '64 Impala?
You like that?
I mean, you looked badass, man.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Oh, like, holy shit...
Oh, listen, one more thing, one
more thing.
One more thing.
What?
Give me your gun.
Give me your gun.
Oh, you're not serious!
Yes, I am.
Thank you.
You're really going to do this...
after everything we've been
through?
Arm or leg?
This is not going to make you...
Arm or leg?
feel better.
I am thinking... leg.
Because leg is, you know,
there's more flesh...
there's not as much bone.
You know the arm, will...
You know what you are?
It's going to make me...
You are a petty...
feel real better.
Fucking son of a bitch!
Hurts, doesn't it?
You know you could have killed me?
Is that right?
Three more inches to the left...
Don't even say it, man.
you wouldn't be winking at
waitresses anymore.
Oh, I'd still wink, I just wouldn't
be able to do...
anything about it.
You know me, I don't miss.
I never miss. When's the last
time you saw me miss?
You going to carry my ass all
the way the fuck home.
When's the last time you saw
me miss?
Oh, shit, man!
This burns.
That's correct.
You know, I shot you when I
didn't know who you were.
Before we were family.
There's a difference.
But we're family now.
I shot you because...
I know who you are.
No man, that ain't right.
They definitely got the look.
Assholes and windshield sunglasses,
practically CIA uniform.
Can I get you boys anything else?
Are your doughnuts any good?
Tell you the truth, they're
pretty lousy.
Can't tell you how happy we are
to hear that.
You take care.
I saw that.
Saw what?
You winked.
That's a twitch.
Yeah, right.
You know, for a guy who just
blew up $43 million...
all of a sudden, you are a very
generous tipper.
Who said I blew up $43 million?
What are you saying?
I am not saying anything.
What are you hearing?
I am hearing something.
You're saying something.
Well, if you're hearing it, it's
only because you're hearing it...
not because I am saying it.
How much did you keep?
Two million?
That's like one each.
Oh, so, now you get half?
Well, I shot half the guys.
So?
Two million?
