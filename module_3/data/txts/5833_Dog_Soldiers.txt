You were right.
This is definitely better than being at work.
One thing you didn't warn us
about though -- bloody midges.
You big girl's blouse!.
Anyway, now that you've mentioned work...
... and seeing as I bullied you
to come here to celebrate...
Here.
Congratulations.
No knight should be without his sword.
I don't know what to say.
What, my writer lost for words?.
It's perfect.
Yeah, and it's also solid silver so don't lose it!
Nice try, Private Cooper.
You've evaded capture for twenty-two hours...
... and forty-seven minutes.
Go straight to the head of the class.
Of course, the real trick to survival...
... lies not in running and hiding...
... but in removing your enemy's capacity
to hunt you down.
Here. Shoot the dog.
I'm sorry, sir, what?.
Take the weapon and use it.
During the seIection process,
you are under my command!
That's a direct order, Cooper!
You're taking the piss, right?.
He thinks I am pulling his Ieg. Do I Iook Iike
a sodding soldier comedian, Shitwipe?. !
No, sir!
I still won't do it.
You don't have a choice. Finish the job.
Shoot the dog.
Shoot it!
No, sir!
What use are you to my team...
... if you can't even kill a dog?.
I didn't say I couldn't kill a dog, sir.
I just will not kill that dog for no reason.
You're binned, Cooper.
-I don't need a man of conscience.
-You're failing me for this?.
You failed yourself!
We're on a different level here, Cooper.
For that...
I need men of action...
... not deeds.
No! You sick fucking bastard!
It's just a dog. That's all.
Maybe one day
when that's sunk into your thick skull...
... you'll be ready for us.
Until then, you live and learn.
Yeah, but you don't.
I don't do second chances, Cooper.
And I never forget.
RTU this pathetic piece of shit.
Send him back to his squad.
I want a good, clean dispersal.
I want a secure landing zone.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Joe, get out of the pissing chopper!
I'm not missing the footy for this,
it's totally bone!
I'm not going, sarge. I'm not going!
See you.
Cooper... I want a position and bearing.
-I want to be on the move in three minutes.
-On it, Sarge.
Spoon, Terry, you're on stag.
Joe, for fuck sake...
... get off your big, fat, Iardy arse
and make like a soldier!
Right then -- time sync.
I've got zero seven-thirty coming up in...
... three, two, one, check.
Oh bullocks, I don't believe this!
What is it now, Witherspoon?.
I've left my watch at the barracks, sarge.
You want to take a breather
every once in a while, son, you'll live longer.
Nice work, Spoon, you tosser.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
And you'll be taking my boot out your mouth
in a minute, Joe, you baldy twat!
Pissing hell!
Close shave,eh Joe?.
Oh, this shit is totally bone!
The most important football match
of my life is playing tonight...
... and I'm stuck up the backside of beyond
without so much as...
... a six-pack or a telly!
Yeah, well, that's the Army for you.
Hey, it's England v Germany, man.
Full-on footy war!
Yeah, well, it's nothing Iike this at all then,
is it Joe?.
It's just an exercise. Hardly life or death.
Don't bet on it, Joe, you're fucking slaying me!
If you'd paid any attention at all
during the briefing, Kirkley...
... you'd know exactIy who we were up against
on this harmless little exercise, wouldn't you?.
-And who's that then?.
-Special Forces, you plonker!
Bollocks to them!
All right, all right.
Now Iisten up, I'm gonna make this quick
and to the point...
... because, just Iike you, all I wanna do
is get home...
...jump into a warm bed with a nice hot woman
and watch the footy!
Planning on scoring, sarge?.
Yeah, well, mind you don't fouI her
in the penalty box.
All right, button it, private parts!
Now, as of this moment as far as we're
concerned, we are fifty 'K' behind enemy lines.
Now, if we do happen to make a contact...
... I expect nothing Iess than
gratuitous violence from the lot of you.
Because we're firing blanks
it doesn't mean we have to be thinking...
nice thoughts.
So you remember you put the fire down, right?.
You get stuck in and you kick their
fucking teeth out...
... or I'll guarantee you, Joe, they will be having
your bollocks for breakfast, sunshine!
Hard-boiled or fried, sarge?.
Scrambled.
Here you are, Spoonie.
Oh, smart.
Because it's nice and new and shiny
doesn't mean it's worth shit.
Remember I want that back, son.
What about you, sarge?.
Well, I'll count, won't l?.
Right then, Coop, what we got?.
We're here. The front line is here.
AWAC reports enemy positions here,
here and here.
With sweeping patroIs between
each of these forward bunkers...
... they'll have the whoIe sector wrapped
tighter than an Eskimo's nad-sack.
With one exception.
Right here.
A river crosses the line through a gorge
thirty or forty feet deep...
... and it's certain to have a patroI on it,
but if we go at night...
... tread careful and
don't mind getting our feet wet...
... I reckon we can make it through.
What the fuck is all this about then?.
Oh, with my Iuck IateIy,
I need all of the help I can get.
I know you think it was a piss poor call,
you failing selection and all of that, but...
... I gotta say, I'm not sorry.
The squad wouId be a Iot worse off
without you, mate.
It was something I had to do, you know.
For myself, get it out my system.
Listen, the onIy peopIe who go Iooking for
trouble are Kamikazes...
... glory boys and full-on fucking fuckwits!
Take my advice son, be patient.
Right then, ladies...
... pack up your troubles...
... put your brains in first gear and start tabbing!
Spoonie, you're on point.
Terry, Joe, tail-end Charlies.
Over here, Cooper, on my head.
You twatter!
I can't believe I'm missing the footy for this party!
Joe, if you don't shut up, I swear to God
I'm gonna fucking slot you myself!
-Now move!.
-Didn't say a word, sarge.
Where the hell are we now?.
I heard a cracking story about this place.
You what?.
PeopIe disappear out here.
Happens all the time.
Go on, Cooper, lad, give it some boolocks.
It's true.
Just Iast month a young coupIe were hiking
through these woods.
They set up camp somewhere near here.
During the night - something happened.
A mountain rescue team found the remains
of the camp a couple of days alter.
The tent was ripped to shreds
and there was blood everywhere!
The papers said it was a monster
like The Beast of Bodmin Moor.
Locals claimed it was an escaped lunatic.
But no-one's been caught so nothing
can be proved either way.
Every year more and more peopIe
come through here...
... and every one in a whiIe
they don't come back.
No trace, no bodies -- just disappear...
... and never seen again.
Contact camp.
Tell them the flock is heading for the fold.
Broadsword to base.
Come on then, Bruce, what scares you?.
The seIf-destructive nature
of the human condition.
You're just taking the piss now!
What, you think so?.
What about you then, Spoon?.
Castration.
There's no argument there. Joe?.
Joe, onIy one thing guaranteed
to put the shits up me.
A penalty shoot out.
-Figures.
-Terry?.
Watching a penalty shoot out -- with Joe.
What about you, Coop?.
Spiders -- And women.
And -- spider women.
I want to know what scares the sarge.
Piss off, man, nothing scares the sarge!
Oh, I don't know about that.
Well, the thought of never seeing my wife again
scares the shit out of me!
That and those IittIe things
that make your skin crawl...
... and the hair stand up
on the back of your neck.
You mean like Spoon?.
No, there's one thing actually, in particular...
... that I'll remember till the day that I die.
Yeah, it was back in ninety-one,
just before my unit was flown out to Kuwait...
... to mop up the last pockets of resistance.
Me and this young fella called Eddie Oswald...
... decided to go and get a tattoo done...
... to commemorate our first trip into the desert.
Yeah, I remember Eddie.
He was a stocky hard case...
... with a broken nose and a bong eye, yeah?.
Yeah, that's him. Good-Iooking fella.
Big hit with the ladies.
Anyway, me and Eddie,
we went and had a few drinks...
... we had a lot of drinks...
... then we went down to the tattoo parIour
and I got a Deser Rat done...
... and Eddie being Eddie wanted something
with a bit more meaning.
And being a bit of a believer...
... he said that his soul still belonged to God...
... but his fIesh, well, his fIesh
was way beyond redemption...
... and it was up to Satan to save his skin.
So he got this fucking great Iaughing deviI
tattooed right on his arse.
Anyway, about six days Iater we were making a
regular sweep along the lraqi border...
... and Eddie, poor fucker,
triggered an anti-tank mine.
Yeah. We all saw it happen.
I mean, he was on point.
White blinding lightning flash and
a fucking deafening crack.
And by the time we picked ourseIves up
off the deck, Eddie was...
... he was gone.
Just bits and pieces of him.
That's all that remained.
This big fucking red circle. Hundred metres.
I'll tell you something, Iads,
it really puts things in perspective...
... when you have to scoop your mate up
with a shovel and
stick him in a bin-bag.
Anyway, the thing that...
... really did our nuts in that day was when you...
... came across a bit you recognised.
Bit of ear -- toe, a nose, a tooth.
But the thing that really freaked us out that day...
... was when Left Hand CharIie found
the bit of Eddie with the tattoo on.
I mean everything eIse was burnt to a crisp,
covered in claret.
All mushed up, pulped up.
Not this bit. This bit was perfect.
And there's OId Nick chortIing
his fucking arsehole off at us!
So you could say that Eddie was right...
... that Satan did indeed save his skin,
just not all of it.
Or you could say that Eddie was just unlucky.
Either way it taught me to
keep a very open mind.
Boom boom.
Anyway... Eddie Oswald.
-To Eddie.
-To Eddie.
So, anyway, this bloke walks into a pub, right...
... with a little dog under his arm.
He puts it down on the bar, goes and sits down.
The bartender's looking at him thinking
"What the fucking hell's going on here??".
Then he looks back at the dog and,
to his surprise, the dog turns round and says...
It's a fucking cow!
Fucking hell!
Ceasefire, Terry, ceasefire.
Terry, what the hell are you doing?.
You're firing blanks, man!
Is everyone all right?.
No man, I think I've shit myself!
Is it dead?.
Oh yeah, it's dead all right.
-Christ, Iook at the state of it!
-Sod that, man, look at the state of Terry.
These aren't entry wounds --
More like teeth marks.
What are you saying, Cooper?.
What he's saying, Terry, is
it died of natural causes, mate.
Don't you think we should call this in, sarge?.
Aye, get on the radio, Bruce.
Now there's no way I'm about
to break radio silence...
... because you Iot got spooked
by a dead flying fucking cow!
No, we hoId this position.
We keep it secure till the morning...
... then we reassess the situation.
Right, I want a watch posted.
Two on, four off.
Brucie, Spoon, you're up first.
Cooper and I will reIieve you
at zero one hundred hours.
And in meantime - Terry sort your kit out!
The rest of you get your heads down.
Unbelievable.
Sarge...cow came in from this direction...
... straight off the edge.
Out of the frying pan on to the fire.
Bleeding to death
it couId have wandered around for miIes
before it got here.
Yeah, well, it's good of it to Ieave
some breadcrumbs for us to follow, eh?.
-Looking for troubIe?.
-No, Cooper -- just looking.
Sarge, shouIdn't we just report this
when we get back?.
Too fucking right, Terry. But in the meantime,
I'm curious and it's on our way.
Come on, lads.
Natural causes, my arse.
Oh, now what?.
Christ on a bike!
What the fucking hell happened here, sarge?.
This is getting more bone by the minute!
Oh, Jesus Christ. Sarge!
Right, lads -- get a grip.
We've got casualties to locate.
So, ditch your bergens,
salvage whatever weapons you can find...
... and stand to.
We are now up against live hostile targets.
So if LittIe Red Riding Hood shouId show up
with a bazooka and a bad attitude...
... I expect you to chin the bitch!
Looks Iike they got hit hard and fast.
Every magazine is full.
Nobody got off a single round.
If they lost, then where are the bodies?.
All right, corporal...
... get on the net and call in.
I want emergency airlift immediately!
I'm on it.
-HoIy shit!
-Contact!
Help me!
Captain!
Ryan?. ! What happened here?.
Do not tell me you fucking know him?.
Captain Ryan. Special Ops.
Not the fucking dog lover?.
Spearhead Patrol, this is Spearhead Patrol.
Are you receiving?.
He Iooks Iike he took on Jack the Ripper
and came last!
I can patch him up
but he needs a medic right now!
This is emergency Code 64.
You've gotta get me out of here!
Do you understand?.
There was only supposed to be one!
We're working on it, Captain!
- Sarge.
- Not now, Spoon.
Are you receiving?.
- Shit.
- What's wrong, Bruce?.
I can't find a signal!
Didn't you check it?.
Of course I checked it!
And I double checked it and it worked fine!
All right, Bruce, stay on it, see what you can do.
Terry...
... this team must have had their own coms kit.
Have a look a round, see if you can find it. Go!
... have a shufti round the camp,
see if you can find anything else useful.
- Yah, but...
- Not now, Spoon!
This is Spearhead Patrol. Are you receiving me?.
There's only supposed to be one!
Jesus! Charnel House is compromised to fuck!
-Do you copy?.
-What the hell's he doing here?.
All I know is he's Special Forces.
But if this is part of our exercise,
they're not advertising.
No cap badge, no insignia, just tags.
What, you mean it's some kind
of convert action?.
Convert action or not,
they're packing all kind of weird shit!
Tranquillizer darts, nets...
... you name it.
This is less like a Special Ops mission...
... more like a fucking safari.
Sarge, I found their radio.
-Oh shit! I don't believe it!
There was only supposed to be one!
What's he on about, sarge?.
Terry, get back on stag now.
You've got to get me out of here
before they come back!
Who, captain?. Who is going to come back?.
They tore them to pieces in front of my eyes!
He's off on one, sarge!
If we don't get him somewhere warm soon,
he's gonna die of hypothermia!
Stay with me, captain.
Ryan, stay with me!
Not now, Spoon!
I don't know if you care but in about
half an hour it's gonna be dark.
Does anybody copy?.
-Any joy?.
-Fuses are blown.
Can you fix it?.
Well, maybe it was fauIty or maybe some damp
got in the casing, but it's fried the circuits.
Well...
... it's useless, mate, bin it.
I also found this.
It was attached inside. Not part of the radio.
Look like a transmitter.
Why would they put a bug in our radio?.
it's the Kobayashi Maru test.
They've fixed it so we can't fucking win!
Button it, Spoon!
No, Terry, it's probably some joker didn't want.
Joe to hear the footy results.
Laugh?. I nearly shat!
Can we scrounge anything useful?.
Weapons, ammunition...
... couple of magnesium flares.
That's about it. The rest's fucked!
Right, Iads ditch your 80s. From here on
in the exercise is well and truly over.
Anyone not carrying Iive rounds
had better do so.
it won't make any difference.
-They won't die.
-Yeah, well...
-..this gives me better peace of mind, sir.
You want peace of mind...
... run for your Iives before they tear your Iegs
from under you!
Now you just shut up like a good gentleman!
You are scaring my lads.
What the fuck... !
Oh Christ!
- Oh, Shit!
- All right, lads grab what you can...
... head for the tree line. We're moving. Let's go.
Right, I need a volunteer for rearguard action.
-I'll do it.
-Nice one. When we're clear, you fall back.
We're gonna be there to cover you.
Right, off you go!
Bruce -- no heroics.
Right, Spoonie, you're on point!
Joe, help Ryan. Terry, you're up next.
Coop, you're with me!
Right, lads,
Iet's have it through the Iong grass!
Double time! Go!
Come on, sunshine, fucking shift it!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Bruce. Bruce!
Cooper, get out of it!
lncoming!
Coming up on both rear flanks!
- To your rear!
-Target!
-Coming through.
-Target!
Keep moving!
Covering fire!
They're going for a flanking position!
They're cirling us!
Covering fire!
Coming through!
Target!
Covering fire!
Reload!
Fucking get out!
Just fucking leg it!
Target!
Lads!
On me! On me!
Stop!
Get in!
-Everybody on me!
-Hurry!
Company, fire!
ln! ln! ln!
Safety!
Oh, shit!
Just drive!
Now!
I'm trying!
Fucking floor it!
Joe, stab it!
Try reverse.
Stab it, Joe!
Now forward.
Everybody okay back there?.
Any more casualties?. Spoon?.
-No, I'm all right.
-What about Bruce?.
-Where's Bruce?.
-Bruce is gone!
He's gone!
Oh, fuck it!
Just hang on back there!
Thank you.
That's okay. What happened?.
What happened?. We were attacked by huge
fucking howling things! That's what!
You were lucky I found you.
I was about to give up hope.
You knew we were here?.
I heard gunfire last night.
I knew someone was out there.
If you weren't aIready in troubIe,
then you soon would be.
We are -- Two men are down.
Both need medical attention.
We need to dress the sarge's wounds
before we can take him too far.
There's only one farm in this glen, but...
... the owner are friends.
We can take your men there.
Hello.
-Nobody home?.
-I don't know where they could be.
Right.
Stand back.
Little pigs, little pigs --
we've come to nick your video!
You sit.
Sit. Sit.
You stay.
All clear.
-What the fuck happened back there, Copper?.
-I don't know, mate.
She might have some answers.
All clear upstairs.
Where the hell are we now?.
Home sweet home.
Set him down.
Spoon, get a field dressing on that wound.
Terry, keep an eye out front.
Come on.
Shit!
What are you doing to me?.
-Is there a teIephone here?.
-What?. No.
Still hot, lads.
Wait. You can't just help yourself!
I'm chin-strap and I'm bloody starving.
I can't help myself.
It's the training, miss.
Never waste an opportunity to eat. Come on.
See...
... now look what I'm doing!
Get it down your necks, lads.
Hold it. Hold it.
Top grub. What is it?.
Don't know, (mate). Looks like pork.
Yeah, well, Ieave some for us,
you greedy mongrels!
Miss, where is the nearest phone?.
Fifty miles as the crows flies.
What about the nearest population centre?.
You mean a town?.
Well, Fort William but it's at Ieast
four hour drive back the way we just came.
Do you think your wounded can make it?.
We have to try. The sarge is in serious troubIe
if we don't.
You seem to know these roads.
-Will you take us?.
-Right now?.
Well, unIess you friends have just gone
walkabout, this place may be compromised.
Fine. Sooner the better.
Let's go.
Right. Spoon, on me.
Everyone eIse, hang back
till we bring the car about.
Joe, help sarge.
Terry, watch him.
Safeties off.
Don't shoot.
Don't stare back.
I can't help it.
Go!
Come on!
Cooper, have you gone spare or what?.
-Cooper, you radgie!
-That puts the kibosh on that plan!
That was my car!
Give us a fucking hand here!
Oh my God!
Fuck off!
Fuck that!
Stand back!
Bloody hell!
Go on, son!
What the fucking hell's happening?.
Terry, right flank. Cover the window!
For Christ's sake, Terry, man, get a grip!
That's bloody charming, that is!
You incompetent moron!
Do you want to have a fucking go, like?. !
Bathroom?.
Upstairs. Far end of passage.
We need to talk, Ryan.
Doesn't look like I'm going anywhere, does it?. !
Joe, Spoon, look like we're staying.
You know what to do.
I want a secure perimeter
with a clear field of fire.
But give them something inviting.
Right?.
-I'm on it.
Terry, are you okay?.
-I've got a reaI craving for a kebab.
-I'll take that as a yes.
Right, we've got limited ammunition.
I want you to get as many pots
and pans as you can lay your hands on...
... fill them with water and keep them
on the boil, all right?.
Terry...
... whiIe you're at it, stick the kettIe on.
We could all do with a brew.
Terry give us a hand with this.
Other side. Other side. Ah, you fool!
You came here because of them, right?.
I don't have a fucking clue what 'they' are.
And right now, I don't really care.
Then what are you doing here?.
This was supposed to be
a routine training exercise and that's all.
So this wasn't a rescue mission?.
No, I guess not.
Back door's secure.
What's happening here, Spoon?.
Well, they're still moving around our there...
... but they're keeping their distance,
staying within the tree line.
Maybe they've had enough for one night.
Not likely.
They're smart. You've seen what they can do.
My guess...
... is they're doing exactIy
what you'd be doing in their shoes.
They're working as a team.
Looking for a weakness, a way in.
I'm not about to second guess these things.
They're enemy, simple as that.
This is no ordinary enemy.
You know what this reminds me of?.
Rourke's Drift.
A hundred men of HarIech
making a desperate stand...
... against ten thousand Zulu warriors.
Outnumbered, surrounded...
... staring death in the face,
not flinching for a moment.
Balls of British steel.
You're bloody loving this, aren't you?.
It's totally bone -- That's all there is to say.
So, what are we talking about here, wolves?.
Not entirely wolf. Not all human,
but something in between.
Wolfmen?. You're having a laugh, right?.
I may be nuts but I'm not fruitcake!
Fine. Stay here and drink tea!
I thought you might be here because of them,
but I guess not.
Just don't be an arsehole!
I like your new girlfriend, Coop.
How are you feeling?.
A touch of gas.
And the fact that various body parts
are trying to vacate the premises...
... fucking awful!
- It's hot.
- Cheers.
Heads up!
For crying out loud, man!
Short controlled bursts!
Do you have a name, soldier?.
Cooper.
Gonna need your help here, miss.
My name is Megan.
And I know how to kill them.
Shit, sarge, you're leaking like a sieve!
Look, I need you to get some supergIue
and some whisky, all right?.
I'll see what I can do.
-Come on.
-No, no, no...
sorry about the arsehoIe thing.
I've got a mean streak a mile across.
That's all right. It's the Ieast of my worries
right now.
Can you pass me my gun, please?.
Thank you.
Come on, Coop, up the wooden hill.
-Where are we going, Coop?.
-You don't wish to know, mate.
What's the glue for?.
Ever wondered why the best thing that
superglue sticks together is your fingers?.
-Fucking get off!
-Give it. Give it.
Forget your grandma's china cups...
... this stuff was deveIoped for the Vietnam war
to patch up broken soldiers.
How are you feeling, sarge?.
Absolutely fucking top fucking bollocks!
Are you sure he shouId be
chasing painkillers with whisky?.
Yeah, well, he's earned it.
-Is it your birthday, Coop?.
-No, mate.
Is it my birthday?.
No, but you're gonna thank us
for this in the morning.
I'll tell you something, mate,
I'm gonna fucking thank you right now.
I'm gonna thank you because you saved my Iife.
You got me out of there, mate.
Yeah, well, you wouId have done
the same thing.
If I'd done the same fucking thing,
I would have saved Bruce -- wouldn't l?.
Yeah, fuck!
Sausages!
I'll tell you something, miss, right...
... this geezer here, right, is my best mate.
He's the salt of the fucking earth.
I mean, don't get me wrong, the rest of the
geezers in the squad, they're all right,
lovely fellas and stuff...
... and any single one of them could marry my...
... marry my sister -- if I had one.
I'll tell you what, I love him. I love you...
... like a mate that l... that I love.
Would you like to be alone?.
Oh, you -- dirty fucker!
Here.
-It's the adrenaIine.
-I'll stick, you bond.
I'll tell you something,
someone better get fucking stuck in soon...
... because this is really starting to hurt!
-What's up?.
-Cooper, knock me out. Hit me!
Oh you fucking pussy, hit me...
Go, go.
-So, how Iong have you Iived round here?.
-Two years.
Came here for wildlife.
I'm a zoologist.
So, you've heard those stories as well then.
Yeah, I heard the stories, I went Iooking,
I found evidence.
-I was fascinated by the possibiIity that...
-You can't seriously believe in werewolves?.
Straight out of college, I'd have Iaughed
at the suggestion, but now...
... I know they're as real as you and me.
Before tonight is over, you will too.
There -- I think that will hold.
-You done this before?.
-Oh, yeah.
We gIue peopIe's gut together
all the time out here.
Everyone tooled up?.
To the nines.
You'll have a fucking eye out with that, lad.
Right, Terry, look sharp!
The rest of you...
... I know things have gone from shit to bone...
... to worse in the last twenty four hours, but...
... if we pull our weight and do the job...
...we still have a fighting chance.
No more running.
We stand, here. We fight.
Right?. -- Any questions?.
Oh, just the one, Coop.
Exactly what is it we're fighting against?.
Megan?. You want to run it past the boys?.
-Lycanthropes.
-You what?.
That's werewolves to you and me.
-You're taking the piss?.
-What?. Makes perfect sense to me!
What, you mean like full moons,
siIver bullets and eyebrows
that join in the middle?.
Before you dismiss it offhand,
think about what you've seen and heard.
The full moon, the teeth...
... the cIaws, the howIing.
Is it so difficult to believe?.
For a whole year now...
... I've tracked these things.
I've studied them. Tried to understand them.
Ever month, when the moon is full...
... they hunt as a team. Dedicated to the kill.
During that time, at Ieast fifteen peopIe
have vanished.
Hikers mostly. In small groups or alone.
They're caught out in the open, hunted down,
torn apart and devoured.
I've never witness the actuaI sIaughter,
but the next day...
... no bodies, no werewolves -- just blood.
The eyebrow's thing is nonsense.
It's just Dark Age paranoia. And silver bullets...
... no-one's ever get close enough to try.
I'm sold.
Slow down, Spoon, but Megan may have a point.
I'm still not convinced
that these things didn't just escape
from the local nuthouse...
... and forget to shave or trim their nails.
But they're out there and we're in here.
What they may or may not be...
... does not affect our immediate situation
one bit.
This is bone.
This is so fucking bone!
Anything else?.
Yeah, what does bone mean?.
Bone - bollocks. Naff.
Not very good.
Right. Anything else I should know?.
Call-signs. If you need to be specific.
Upstairs, you've got Sergeant Wells
who you seem to know inside and out by now.
You've got Spoon over there.
The vomiting cavalier, Terry.
The big guy with the axe is Joe.
Didn't you forget someone?.
Ryan.
Captain Ryan is not one of our team.
His being here is hazy at best.
If I could tell you, I would.
But I'm just a soldier -- like you.
No stripes -- no insignia.
A suit in a uniform does not make a soldier.
He's with Special Ops.
His team were wiped out Iast night.
He was the only survivor.
I'd advise you against pursuing
this line of questioning, Private Cooper.
Are you pulling ranks on me now, captain?.
You can shove that right up your arse!
I'm saying my being here is a most point...
... since I'm now in as much shit as you are.
We're all in the same fucking shit.
And we need each other.
I doubt I need you.
You bloody did two hours ago!
The Uaths.
Crying like a baby, you were.
That was then. Circumstances change.
What?.
Uath - it's Celtic.
The family has lived in this glen for centuries.
So, what was he doing out there?.
I have an idea.
But I want to hear it from the horse's mouth.
Come to think of it, Ryan, how are you feeling?.
I'm fine.
When we found you,
you couId bareIy open your eyes,
let alone walk...
... and then later, you managed to run...
... and now Iook at you -
fighting fit and sitting pretty.
Hardly the behaviour of a man who...
... until recently, was knocking on death's door.
I have a strong constitution.
You're not bloody kidding!
Then you won't mind if I have a Iook
at that wound of yours.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
I have a responsibility to my patient.
I'm warning you, Cooper, don't touch me!
Get back!
Tie him up. I want him to talk.
-What are you gonna do, torture him?.
-Don't know.
-What wouId you do?.
-I'd torture him.
What now?. !
They've shut down the generator.
-Why would they do that?.
Because they can see in the dark.
And you're afraid of it.
This is a pile of rancid shit!
Now what do you believe?.
I'm beginning to believe you,
but I think Joe might have worded it better.
They're on the move!
All right this is it!
Mark your targets and preserve your ammo.
Three round bursts.
We've only got one stun grenade apiece...
... so only use them if absolutely necessary.
-Stand to.
-Come on then.
-What can I do?.
-What do you want to do?.
Run and hide. I know what's coming.
Take care of Sam.
Keep an eye on Ryan.
If he tries anything, pan him.
Chasing that first kiss, are we, Cooper?.
It's as simple as this.
If you're not there for us...
... we're not here for you.
Contact!
Die!
Spoon, get down!
Fucking back!
Fuck!
Fire in the hole!
Cooper!
... Hurry!
Cheers, mate.
Sarge.
Cooper!
Sarge!... Sarge!
Bastard!
Sarge, wake up!
Fucking wake up, you bastard!
Sarge!
Say 'cheese', you fucker!
Wake up!
Fuck! Sarge!
Dogs?. More like pussies!
You all right?.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm peachy, mate.
Coop...squad's yours, mate.
They took Terry.
Then we go and get him back!
Too fucking right!
Forget about him.
What did you say?.
He's dead, Cooper, and you know it.
Shit!
Somebody must have heard some gunfire!
-Somebody must have heard something!
-Who?.
The onIy other house within fifty miIes
of here is mine. And l', not there!
Well, what about the road, man?. Passers-by?.
Do you have any idea what kind of luck you had
running into me out there tonight?.
I thought you ran into us?.
Joe, check upstairs.
Even if anyone did come by,
they would only end up...
... lambs for the slaughter like you.
Our only hope is daylight.
The sun rises in six hours.
We did the best we could.
But if the sarge's condition deteriorates...
... he'll have less than four.
And the only thing holding them back...
... is they don't know how much ammunition
we have left.
Let's have a look at that.
Tell me. Honestly, what are our chances?.
Morale seems good, considering.
But that will only last
as long as the ammunition holds out.
High spirits are just no substitute
of eight hundred rounds a minute...
... but I don't think that's what
you wanted to hear.
Think about it, Cooper - up until today...
... you beIieve there was a Iine
between myth and reality.
May have been a very fine line sometimes,
but -- at least there was a line.
Those things out there are real.
And if they're real, what else is real?.
You know what lives in the shadows now.
You may never get another night's sIeep
as long as you live.
So, why worry, Cooper?.
You may not live that long.
Shut your mouth!
We are gonna make it through this.
You know why?.
I don't scare that easy.
Here.
It's supposed to be lucky.
For me, or the rest of the rabbit?.
-You'll need a lot more than luck this time.
Shut up, Ryan!
Listen to me, Cooper...
... ignore him. We can survive till sunrise.
That's all that matters.
-It's just a few more hours.
Wait a minute. Am I missing something here?.
I know him.
I was seconded to his team
during their first visit here.
First visit?. What first visit?.
What the fuck are you talking about?.
They came to check out the stories.
They needed an expert.
It's just a few more hours, Cooper.
That's all it is.
All clear?.
-Yeah.
-You wanna kill them all?.
-Yes.
-Good. Keep it up.
What's the damage, Spoon?.
Well, we might have pissed on our chips.
We've only got two full mags for MP5s...
... six rounds for the shotgun...
... and one spare, just in case.
Stay sharp, everyone.
We were putting fire down all over.
I mean, we filled those things with Iead and they
just kept on getting up and coming back at us.
Sixty rounds, man, ain't gonna last two minutes.
So, either we all make a break for it
and fight our way clear or...
... or the rest of us keep them occupied
while one of us goes for help.
And by the time the cavalry get here...
... they'll have to pick what's Ieft of us
from between their fucking teeth!
Fucking brilliant!
We either stay and snuff it or we all go --
and snuff it!
Decisions, decisions.
Laugh?.
-I nearIy died.
-Who's stopping you?.
Right, that's it!
We'll fucking have him!
Take it easy, big man. Calm down.
Do any of you know how to hot-wire a car?.
What?.
They keep an old Land Rover in the barn.
I don't know where the keys are...
... but if one of you couId break in and start it,
then...
I can do that.
-Are you sure?.
-Piece of piss!
Anyway, the further I am from this wanker,
the happier I'll be.
All right you're gonna need a decoy.
Something fast and loud.
What?. You what?.
You sit. Stay.
-You're serious about this werewoIf thing,
aren't you?. -I'm afraid so.
Shit.
Don't suppose you know who won the match.
Didn't even know there was a game on.
It's not a game.
Right, this is it.
Everyone get ready.
Bollocks.
Joe good luck, mate.
You don't get off the hook that easy.
All right, you bastards...
... come and have a go
if you think you're hard enough!
Well, come on, you beauties!
They took the bait!
Come on!
Spoon, run!
Move your fucking arse, soldier!
Come on!
I'm trying!
Pull us!
I love it when a posh bird talks dirty!
Jesus!
Fucking what's happening, Cooper?. !
Fucking cut it!
Get back!
Cut it!
-Cut it!
-Fucking thing!
Cut it!
Shit!
He's done it! Ryan, up!
Everyone else, downstairs.
-Come on, move it! Come on!
-All right, Coop!
Move. Move.
You're behind me, aren't you?.
I'm gonna fucking have you!
Come on.
Ready?. Go, go!
Back!
-Well?.
-She's in a bad way. Fuel pump's gone...
... fan beIt's buggered and she's pissing out
petrol like there's no tomorrow.
The word 'bone' springs to mind.
Joe's body?.
It's gone.
What's the damage, Spoon?.
We're down to forty-eight rounds.
Check the right.
Well, Ryan -- you heard the score.
Maybe one or two of us
are gonna make it through this...
... but I don't care much for our chances.
You like football?.
What?. "They think it's all over"...
... and all that crap?.
No, I don't.
Well, Joe... you remember Joe?.
He liked football. Fucking lived for it.
Is this relevant?.
He missed the most important match
of his life for this bullshit exercise...
... and now he's dead
along with two other mates...
... that I'd have readily given my right arm for!
Too fucking right it's relevant!
You just can't get past the dog, can you?.
We're Iosing, Ryan. We're three-niI down
and we're close to the final whistle.
At the very least, I want to even the score.
I understand your resentment.
But you failed
because you weren't prepared
to take that extra step.
If you'd passed, you wouId have been
on my team...
... and if you were on my team, you'd be dead.
Yeah, I failed, and I'm bloody glad of it.
Because given the choice of taking orders
from a toffee-nosed twat like you...
... and slogging it out with these guys -
I'll take the underdogs any time.
So you can take your precious seIection,
shove it up your arse...
... and stop trying to change the fucking subject!
Fair enough.
But you won't like what I have to tell you.
There are some places you really shouldn't go.
We'll be the judge of that, Ryan.
Ever heard of Special Weapons Division?.
They're the men in white coats
who trains doIphins
to stick mines on submarines...
... and cute furry animals
to tear your head off at the neck.
They saw an opportunity and called me in.
To do what?. Catch one of these things?.
And to bring it back - alive, if possible.
Only 'it' turned out to be 'them'.
-We underestimated enemy numbers.
-Underestimated?.
I'd have a serious word with your head sheds
about the quality of their intelligence.
It may have been their invitation,
but it was my party.
I planned and executed it.
You mean you loused it up.
We lost good men, Ryan. Yours...
... and mine.
I wanna know...
... where we fit in.
The reality is you're expendable.
And I had approval to put you at risk.
Get to the fucking point, Ryan.
I made a gap in enemy lines.
You were good enough to spot it...
... and predictabIe enough to go for it.
That was your bait.
You were mine.
You bastard!
I had to choose somebody.
I remembered you.
Monkey see, monkey do.
They were my men!
Get up, you shit. You know what we can do.
Give us a fighting chance.
Live and learn, Cooper.
I didn't hit him that hard.
You shook something loose.
Bad dog.
Fetch!
Bag the shot!
Clear!
Get off!
Cooper, get down!
I've got target!
WerewoIves spend most of the time
in human form, right?.
And the onIy peopIe from miIes around
live right here.
So these things aren't about
to give up the fight and go home.
-They are home. -Yeah, well,
that makes perfect sense, doesn't it?.
I mean, think about it -
we bust into their house,
we eat all their porridge
we sleep in their fucking beds.
no wonder they're pissed off.
But they're good people, they're kind people.
-More's a pity.
-Why?.
Because we're gonna have to kill them all.
Too right, mate.
What self-respecting werewolf would have
anything silver in the house anyway?.
Yeah, well, fuck the folklore
It's just burn them.
If we knew where to find them.
Maybe we do.
Everything we've seen so far suggests
the behaviour of a pack.
Six to eight members,
an Alpha pair leading the subordinates...
... and a young male, a beta wolf,
second in command, Makes sense.
No, you lost me.
A woIf pack sticks together.
Generally somewhere close to its food supply.
Somewhere safe, sheltered --
and warm.
You're gonna have to move
like shit off a shovel on this one, mate.
You worry about your own shit, all right?.
When we bIow that fuse that pIace is gonna
go up like Zabriskie Point.
-Just make it work.
-Yeah, it's easy-peasy.
Yeah, lemon squeezy.
Listen, Coop... what about the sarge?.
What about the sarge?.
You know what I mean.
Sarge is with us.
Yeah, I just didn't want him to go
without getting his watch back.
You -- stay out of trouble.
You all right?.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine -- Cooper.
I mean, I feel...
... absolutely fantastic.
I mean, that's the problem, isn't it --eh?.
What if she's wrong?.
What if they're not all in there, eh?.
Then we only get some of them.
It's a shit-load better than none of them...
... and marked improvement on all of us.
No, no, no, you listen to me.
You get the fuck out now.
I hoId them back, I keep them occupied
and you get out!
We've Iost enough men for on night,
don't you think?.
Let me show you something.
Now do not tell me that that is fucking normal.
What happened to Ryan is happening to me.
It's just a matter of time, mate.
Yeah, well, stop wasting time
with this hara-kiri crap.
This fight isn't lost yet.
With Ryan it onIy took a coupIe of hours, mate.
It's a full moon.
I mean, I dunno, maybe it's Iike
when you need to take a piss or something.
When you gotta go, you gotta fucking go.
Or maybe it's more like needing a shite.
Just because you need one doesn't mean
you drop your legs and pinch one off.
Anyway, fuck Ryan.
Shifty bastard couId've been
one of those things from the start.
You know, Coop, there's one more thing
you gotta learn about command, mate.
Sometimes the peopIe that you kill --
are your own men.
So I'm asking you let me take care of myself.
And at least spare you the...
... unfortunate business of trying to expIain to
Annie why you had to incinerate me.
We are gonna knock seven coIours of shit
out of these fuckers, we need you.
It's all right, you know, mate.
It's okay.
I just didn't make it out this time, that's all.
It goes with the job, do you know what I mean?.
When I signed my Iife away on that dotted Iine,
I fucking meant it!
I am a professional soldier!
So, what do you want me to do?.
Roast their bollocks off.
All clear.
Good luck.
Light it!
Shit!
Sarge!
I'm sorry.
When I found you out there tonight...
... I truIy beIieved you were the best chance
I had of getting out.
But now we have no chance.
There is no out.
There never was.
I came here to be at one with nature -
well, I got what I wanted.
Now I have to live with it.
-There isn't a house in the next gIen.
-No.
And there were no werewoIves in the barn
when I blew.
Not one.
And the reason you're not in the photograph
is because you took it.
I never meant to...
New woman -- same old shit.
Being nice to women
will get you nowhere, Cooper.
Being nice to me will get you killed.
You may think they're all bitches, but...
... I'm the real thing.
Do you think I Iike being part
of this fucked up family?.
Do you think I chose to run with the pack?.
No. I chose you.
But now you're out of luck, and I'm out of time.
And all we can do is let nature take its course.
They were always here...
... I just unlocked the door.
It's that time of the month.
Somebody had to put it out of its misery.
Come on, Spoon!
Get clear!
Spoonie, stop fucking about!
Fucking shift it, that's an order!
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Come on!
Sarge?.
Sarge?.
I'm in the carzey.
I'm in the carzey.
Come on!
Oh Jesus! Shit!
Go on, Coop! Get stuck in, mate!
Get out of it!
Come on, you fucker!
Come on, come on!
-Cooper, Let's get in the wardrobe, son.
-What?.
-Let's get in the wardrobe.
-Yeah, all right.
What's that smell?.
I dunno.
Fucking hell!
Give me your gun.
Open your mouth, watch your ears,
mind your toes!
Go! Go on!
Where's Spoon?. !
There is no Spoon.
-No, you fucking bastards!
-Help me, Cooper.
-Get in there. Get in there!
-Sam.
What are you doing?. !
-Here, take this.
There's one in the chamber, mate.
I'm fucking binned!
No, No...
We go together or we don't fucking go!
That's my Iast order to you, Do not fuck about.
Do not disobey me!
Come here, you fucking...
Listen to me, you have got
to make it out alive.
It happened. Prove it happened!
Not just for me or my lads...
... for her!
Here...
You have to prove it happened, mate.
Go! Go!
Sam.
Fuck!
Ryan.
You tried licking your own balls yet?.
I forgot -- you don't fucking have any.
Think it's all over?.
It is now.
