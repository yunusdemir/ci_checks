ORCHESTRA REHEARSAL
Come on, try for yourself
The acoustics are excellent
Did you know
that it used to be an oratory?
Those are the tombs of three Popes
and seven bishops
This place is full of dead people
In 1781...
...the oratory became an auditorium...
...for vocal and instrumental concerts
It was the envy
of all the courts in Europe
And do you know why?
Because of its acoustics
Did you hear that? The sound is clear
and there is no echo...
It's ideal for listening to music...
...without the reverberation of sound
On that rostrum stood
the greatest orchestra directors
It was a big achievement for them
What musicians, what an audience!
Ministers, ambassadors and clergymen
used to come here
They would bring
their own music sheets...
...so that they could follow
the concert
There were so many beautiful women
wearing elegant, low-cut dresses
Are you playing tricks on me?
The air was filled
with such a nice perfume
Nowadays the audience
is very different
I am probably boring you
with all this talking
I have set everything up
It looks nice, doesn't it?
I am only the copyist,
I count for nothing
One more year...
...and then I can retire
I will only come back
to attend concerts
That I will do.
I couldn't live without music
Good morning, everyone
I hear a television crew is here today
to make a documentary on our orchestra
Here we are,
in this wonderful auditorium...
...which was built in the 13th century
and used to be a church
You can see here some very old tombs
and to my right...
I have already told them this
- I am the first violin and...
- Good morning
- Good morning
- Good morning, Mirella
Can someone take this cover off?
- It's really heavy
- Let me help you
- Thank you. How are you?
- Not bad
Listen, there is a television crew
but try to act normal
I would like to know
what they do with these chairs
Look at them,
they are so dirty and filthy
Here we go again
I have a sauna at 4:00.
I won't miss it for anything
There are about 30 different poses -
snake, lion, diamond...
But it's all about mind work
Where's the panettone?
Take your time, there's no rush
- You're doing fine
- He looks worse than the last time
- It's nice to have you back
- You seem to be doing well. Slowly
I want to make a bet with him.
In four months time...
I want to tell you
about my uncle Quintilio...
...who for 60 years
lived life to the full
He was the biggest
eater, drinker and lover...
...then one morning he fell ill.
We thought he wouldn't make it
Do you know how old he is now? 93
He eats and drinks like he used to
and reads without glasses. He's immortal
The name of one of Werther's sons...
It starts with 'G '
You wouldn't believe
how rude people can be
- Are you talking about yourself?
- The traffic light was green...
...and the person in front of me wouldn't
let me through, so I kindly asked him...
..."Can you let me through?
I am going to a rehearsal"
He looked at me as if I was
a piece of shit and said...
..."Why do you need to rehearse? I can
tell straight away that you are a twerp"
Are you listening to football? I'm not
going to today, I get too anxious
- What does your barometer say?
- Let's see what my loyal friend says
- Shall we dare taking your violin out?
- It's 15 percent higher
- Are you not going to play?
- It may not be good for my violin
How is the leech today?
It's a tough battle. There's no escape
from leeches, they lie in wait
Bastards
You keep laughing at me
and making jokes about leeches
Don't get upset, it's not good for you
Neurosis really is a leech.
We will all fall victims
They may have paid 800 million lira for
him, but isn't he worth twice as much?
- What's that?
- It's a tranquiliser
- That should make you feel better
- I've tried them all, they don't work
If anything, they make things worse
- What's wrong with this trumpet?
- Watch this
You idiots!
Do you really think "81/2"
is a psychoanalytic film?
Go back to school!
What is this guy doing? How am I
supposed to play? Hey, Mr Barometer
Get up and put your chair back
to where it was. I need room to play
I am sorry but I am too close to the
music stand like this. I can't read
- It has to stay here
- Are you kidding me?
It has to stay here
I even asked if you minded
I've forgotten my glasses
- I'm not here to do favours, but to play
- It has to stay here
- I want it there!
- And I want it here!
- That's your place and this is my place
- Mind how you talk! You're offending me
- There!
- What's wrong with him?
- Stop it! I said stop it!
- No, you stop it!
Gentlemen, please.
May I have your attention?
We have a very special guest.
Television
The crew and the directors are here...
...to film the rehearsal
of our orchestra
They also want to interview
some of you
They'd better not,
or I will tell them everything
- What would you tell them?
- For instance, that you take money
As agreed with your trade union
representative, in return for this...
...you will receive nothing
We haven't agreed to this
Mr Trincia, this is extra work
It's extra work!
- Who said it's extra work?
- No way!
We don't agree
In theory we could do it, but according
to trade-union rules it's unacceptable
This is the ongoing problem
with television
Your trade union representative is here
Calm down. Gentlemen, calm down
What do you mean?
We are already underpaid...
...and now television
doesn't want to pay us at all?
I think people
who are interested in music...
...will enjoy seeing
how you work behind the scenes
Since this is going to be made
into a programme...
...television should give us something
in return
Nobody has to do it
If you want to do it, you can, and if
you don't want to do it, that's fine
This is not fair
Let me just tell you something
- What better opportunity...
- What kind of trade unionist are you?
You are just
a bunch of stupid empty heads
I had a terrible dream.
There was a horse in my bedroom
It sounds terrible, however it depends
on the colour of the horse
- Nice dress
- Idiots!
Do you want to interview me as well?
Well, I have it all written down
Some of the things are his suggestions
- Are they going to pay us?
- A piano is like a king on his throne
It doesn't move. Cecco told me this
You have to go up there, take a bow
and push the seat closer
It's like a huge mythological animal.
He also said this
It makes you feel uneasy
A room with a piano in it
becomes the piano room
- It is best suited to a royal court
- I once played at court
- What did you say?
- I was saying that I once played at court
- Where?
- Before king Vittorio Emanuele III
And he didn't have you arrested?
I don't want a piano
I mean, I have my own piano
but I don't want it
- Really?
- Because all pianos are the same
- Interesting
- Playing just on your piano is limiting
- It's like having brakes on
- Brakes?
I believe that...
...to be fulfilled
one needs to know...
...different people and
have more opportunities to meet up...
Stop making me laugh
OK, I am from Marina di Pisa...
...but I studied flute in California
There it's played more gently
than here
The flute is a delicate instrument
It's the instrument that is closest
to the human voice
Although the same is said
about the cello and the saxophone...
...and perhaps even about the drums!
The funny thing is that a good chorus
is never compared to an instrument
Only the flute sounds
like a human voice
What a mysterious sound.
Supernatural!
It can tame wild animals,
what more do you want?
Didn't Apollo used to wake up the dead
with the flute?
It can do so many things, it's magical
The sun and the moon, day and night
Hasn't the doctor told her
that flautists are all mad?
Yes, it's true. That's what people say
Perhaps with all this blowing...
...eventually air gets into
their heads, poor flautists!
Everyone always expects them to do
something strange. I don't know why
The trombone is a unique instrument
It has a deep, almost reprimanding
voice. But it can also be funny
Just think of circus clowns
spraying water and blowing raspberries
- It's also the angels' instrument
- That's true
Have you noticed that angels play
the trombone in Renaissance paintings?
Wouldn't it be nice to be greeted
by God at the sound of trombones?
The sound of a trombone is like
the voice of a solitary creature
I like listening to it
when I am by the seaside...
...during the winter,
and there is nobody around
- Yours was a TV show-style ending
- I have nothing to say
I was looking at
that spider line up there
Can you see it?
It must be five or six metres long
While the brass was playing,
it was swinging back and forth
- Look, Lo Cucco. Can you see it?
- What do you want?
- Can you see the spider?
- What?
It's hanging there. Come over this side,
you may be able to see it better
Can you see it? Isn't it sweet that
we're here to make a spider swing?
Look, Esposito. Look for yourself
That little spider earlier,
while the brass was playing...
- Can we interrupt you for a moment?
- Of course
- I have a frivolous question to ask you
- Go ahead
Is it true that instruments
don't always get on with each other?
Yes, it's true.
Some get along and some don't
Percussion gets along
with double bass...
...because
they both beat time accurately...
...instead of performing arpeggios
and elaborate moves
Pianos are very talkative,
while violins go on and on about it
In Italy, you don't hear rhythmic music
a lot. We're more into singing
Only Neapolitans can feel the beat.
They're among the best percussionists
Where is <i>tarante//a</i> from? Naples
I'd also like to say that in an orchestra,
percussionists are the nicest...
...funniest and most friendly
of musicians
What Claudio is saying is true...
...because the air of superiority...
...and the condescending voice that
a violinist or a flautist can have...
...is something you will never see
in this orchestra
If you let a good-for-nothing join the
orchestra, what is he going to play?
The cymbals and the drums, because
they are playful and joyful instruments
When the director is upset,
we cheer him up by playing a bit
When people are feeling low,
this lifts their spirit
I don't want to be interviewed. I don't
like to have my pictures taken...
...as people could mistake me
for someone else. No way
My colleague perhaps...
- Excuse me?
- Yes
- Would you answer some questions?
- You don't deserve it
It's unfair that you are not paying us
but since you're here, let's hear them...
I don't know what to ask you.
Tell me about the cello
The cello is one of the key instruments
in an orchestra. We could say this
Violins and cellos...
...are the basis for writing
any symphony
Everything revolves around them,
am I wrong?
- Yes!
- Let me tell you what violins are
The first violin is the mind and the heart
of an orchestra, don't forget this
And the clarinet is the willy!
I think a cello...
...is very much like a best friend
It's a true friend
Discreet and loyal, unlike a violin
A violin may seduce you
and fascinate you...
...but it's deceitful, like a woman
He's talking rubbish
My colleague over there doesn't agree
- No, nothing
- Don't you agree?
- No
- Why?
Because we think the violin is the most
manly instrument of the orchestra
No, the violin is female because
it's always trying to seduce us
If you want me to play along,
I will say that the violin is male...
...because it's vibrant and phallic
- I agree with my dear colleague
- Thank you
The violin is not female
It's not a languid and weak instrument.
The violin is vibrant and modern
At music school, it's the youngest
students who want to enrol...
- The cello makes a melancholy sound
- The first violin is the real star
I was just saying that the first violin
is the real star of the orchestra
When there happens to be a director
who slows down the pace...
...doesn't hit the opening bar
and lacks authority...
...we are the first to notice it,
as soon as he steps on the rostrum...
...and raises his baton
In that case, it's the first violin
who takes the lead
He conducts the orchestra...
...and replaces the director
Nonetheless...
Who does the orchestra director shake
hands with at the end of the concert?
With the first violin
Do you know what I said once
to a director?
You like the brass too much. You are
a bandmaster, that's what you are!
What has this got to do with what
we were saying? I'm sorry
Going back to the cello,
I just want to say this
It's an instrument
that will never betray you
Once it's chosen you,
it will always stay by your side
- Idiot!
- The double bassoon
- Only good for the circus!
- I just want to say...
...that I owe everything to the cello.
It's helped me find my identity
- True
- What do you mean?
It has helped me smooth
my rough edges
- Do you want to interview me?
- Why not?
- Shall I go over there?
- Here is fine
My seat is over there
Comb your hair, there will be women
watching you on TV
Of course
The clarinet has allowed me escape...
...the fog of my home town,
Gazolto, in the north of Italy
From the end of August until April
of the following year you can't see it
The bell tower disappears
and so does the school...
- What has this...
- I'm getting there
As a clarinet player,
I travelled around the world...
...and even met the great Toscanini...
...who said to me,
"Well done, young man.
"At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
These are his exact words
"Well done, young man.
At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
- What did you say?
- What can you say?
When Toscanini tells you...
..."Well done, young man.
At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
I wasn't paying attention,
what did he say?
He said, "Well done, young man.
At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
- Who was playing the clarinet?
- It was me
As I said, it's a fascinating
and wonderful instrument
Not to mention its musical potential,
which is extraordinary
The trumpet allows you to make
the most amazing musical acrobatics
But what's really unique is that...
...it enables you to express
what you have inside
Happiness, sadness, silence...
What? Who?
Claudio, come and talk to this guy
Shut up,
I'm being interviewed
Perhaps all three of us were wrong
The trumpet is like a passport
that enables me to travel...
...to a new world
Those who play the trumpet
know what I mean
It's a world of fulfilment,
where everything is more intense
There are plenty of us
and we play the trumpet all together
Mazzieri, tell them that trumpet players
have to study more than anybody
- Speak up. What did you say?
- Our lips are cracked
My colleague is right. We have
to spend hours moistening our lips...
...to soften them before we can play
The degree of approximation
allowed for other instruments...
...is not given to the trumpet
Do you mean the strings don't have
to be as accurate? Shut up!
If you play the wrong note
with a trumpet, you're finished
It's got me ill. I can't sleep anymore
and I have high blood pressure
I've become a sleepwalker
Once I was playing the trumpet
in my pyjamas outside my front door
I'm paranoid that
I'm going to make a mistake
- We did have some work
- Let me speak to him
Hey, article nine!
Use your gramophone for the concert!
That will teach you to negotiate
with your staff
I am your staff!
I am their trade union representative
and I am happy to be interviewed
We have managed to free musicians
from their servile status
We have given musicians
their dignity back
They are no longer pieceworkers
or puppets in the hands of a director...
...or an intermediary, but workers who
are fulfilled and aware of their role
How did we succeed
at such a difficult task?
We safeguarded
their professional status...
...by making a number of demands...
...such as fair salaries...
- You abolished mafia middlemen
- You can tell them about this later
Through a restructuring
of orchestra staff, as I was saying
Hey!
- You don't get it, do you?
- What shall I do with him?
- There's a mouse!
- It's over there!
Behind the painting! Over there!
- There it is!
- It's huge!
Shall I kill it?
- There it is, it's over there!
- Look at it!
- Don't kill it
- Take the broom
- Give it to me!
- Careful!
They're going to open the sewer
if they keep wrecking this place
I've got fire! Let me through
Let's burn it. Throw it in there
Watch out, it's coming towards you!
Catch it!
Bloody hell, it's fighting back!
It's biting!
At last!
- I don't want to see it!
- Let's cook it, it'll make a nice meal
Stop it. Throw it away!
You are disgusting! Throw it away
Go back to your seats!
We should have put a mouse
in his trumpet
- Back to your seats, the director is here
- He would've had a hard time playing it!
Do you know that my wife's uncle
ate a mouse during the war
Regards!
This is terrible. I am sorry
but I haven't got time for this now
Can you turn that light off?
I know you have permission to film
but I don't agree with it
- Oboe...
- My feet are cold
I've left my slippers at home
Why are you so interested
in a rehearsal?
This is like a factory or at least
that's how it should be...
...where we try to make something
What are we trying to make now?
We are trying to make something but
I don't know what it is or what it's for
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to carry on
We'll talk later
Turn off that light, please
Strings. Only the strings, please
Please!
What's wrong?
Have you been arguing?
Is that why everyone is going
their own way?
Aren't you all part of the same team?
- No, we're not!
- Why do you bother replying?
Ready...
Stop. Stop!
Play gracefully,
this is not a fun fair!
Passionately but gently.
You are playing violins not trumpets!
<i>Scheise</i> Flute, it's an E flat
not an E natural
- Here it says E natural
- It's an E flat. Look Carefully
- It's really an E natural
- Then change it!
Isn't it strange that you always get
all the copyist mistakes?
Clarinet...
No
It should be delicate and gentle
What are you laughing at?
It's not funny!
I find this passage very funny
I don't think the composer wanted it
to sound humorous
- There's no reason to laugh
- Listen
Even my colleague is laughing
- It's really funny
- You are so funny. Look at your face
I am going to send you four clarinets
I know you need one
but you have to take four
I'll tell you later
- Who scored?
- Couldn't I stay in California?
Look at her!
Where are we? On a football pitch?
Have you mistaken me for a referee?
Too loud! Too penetrating!
You should all be castrated!
He's right. The brass was loud
You are unbelievable!
Pick up those sheets
I am going to send you a guy
called Ciccio Calamina
He is not a musician but you have
to take him on because the minister...
What did he think he was doing?
He wanted us to take a break.
Good on him
Do you remember that crazy guy at
San Carlo who threw his watch at me?
Tomorrow morning, all right?
If it's 400 then I'll give you 20
OK, so on Sunday at Torvaianica.
Take your son with you. Bye
- Come on, let's do Gallop number 15
- Here it is
Stop! Are the strings intimidating you
or do you have low blood pressure?
Let's start from the beginning
Stop! Oboe, you are too loud!
You are not the only one here
From the beginning
Stop! You are tickling that string
You have to cut it
with your bow. Saw it!
Can I ask you all a question?
Do you understand why you're here?
I'm talking to musicians, right?
I want to hear a compact sound.
Let's start from the beginning
Carry on like this!
Come on!
I can't see where you are!
Bass, louder!
Don't lag behind! Come on!
Get moving!
Come on!
Exactly! Louder! Yes!
Four, five, six, attention!
Can Toscanini's favourite...
...be so kind as to repeat
on his own...
...four measures after number 82?
No, I won't.
I have already played twice
To play a third time is to go against
our union agreement
My colleague is right
A passage should be played
by everyone or not played at all
It's like being back at school.
We are all adults here
If I were you, I'd think less about
the union and more about the music
I insist
If Wagner had known
about trade unions and strikes...
...he would have never written
this opera
Now it's the trade unions' fault
if he can't write anything good
I miss not having peace and quiet
My life is shit
You should spread it on your baton...
...and then lick it off
Let's start from measure 330.
Flugelhorn, please
- What was it?
- Flugelhorn
Where is the flugelhorn?
- He's not here
- What do you mean?
I don't know. He's not here
60 and 40...
- He couldn't make it. Why?
- What do you mean?
- Why are you only telling me this now?
- Let me explain
It's not that he couldn't come.
He didn't want to come
As a gesture of protest and in agreement
with the union Bentivoglio belongs to
Who is going to play the flugelhorn?
The sister?
Leave my sister alone
and let's not bring family into this
- I didn't say...
- I have good hearing
I didn't say, "Your sister". I said,
"The sister", meaning the guy's sister
Maybe I don't have enough of a sense
of humour but I don't find this funny
You carry on doing your job...
...and leave our families to us
- Let's carry on. 530, please
- I don't think so
No, not now.
The musicians are quite tired
I am sorry but I don't think
they can carry on rehearsing
Bloody hell.
What do you want from me?
Do you want to drive me crazy?
What do you want?
Do you want my arse?
Here it is!
You can all have a 20-minute break!
I think the director is quite good.
A bit hysterical but within the limits
- There are some who...
- We no longer need directors like him
All we need is a metronome
At concerts,
the audience should sit with us...
...that way the music would sound
very different
There is a difference between watching
a battle at the cinema and fighting it
Noble, ascetic,
restless, authoritative...
...and charismatic,
this is how a director should be
Some are mystic,
priest like, acrobatic
While some act like lion tamers
He used to play the harp, the violin,
the percussions, the bass drum...
...and even the bassoon.
He was so funny!
When you are in front of the camera,
you start chatting away...
I want my teacher to watch me
from up there
If he doesn't look at me,
I get jealous
Are you filming?
<i>We are the /i/ies of the garden,</i>
<i>we are Romans...</i>
Friendship is a different thing
First of all,
we never meet up outside work
In the morning, you have rehearsals,
you clock in
- When you leave, you clock out
- Like in a factory
Me? I thought I was going to travel
the world playing this instrument
- Instead, I'm always here
- Let's hear it
I can't stand this noisy,
fat thing anymore
It makes me feel worthless
An orchestra could easily do without it.
What's the point in having it?
And it's dangerous! A real calamity
You try so hard
to make some nice music...
...but all you get is a loud fart
I think it symbolises...
...dullness and close-mindedness
That's true
In an orchestra, it's the kind
of instrument that cannot...
...integrate with the others
Most musicians come
from the provinces
What provinces?
I come from a big city, Afragola
The truth is that most musicians
have a very modest...
...academic background
We don't have any real interests.
We're into nothing
We spend our lives
glued to our instruments...
...whether they are wind or string ones
I wonder why he's chosen music
I just want to say this.
All these talks...
...about trade unions,
orchestral leaders, politics...
...brass, strings,
this or that director...
None of this matters to me
Why? Because
I can't get it up anymore
Now, that's the real problem,
not the trade unions!
You keep drinking. It will do
a lot of good to your brain and liver!
It's not whiskey. It's only
a bit of white wine to cheer myself up
A little wine does no harm,
if it's of good quality
It's whiskey.
I saw her filling up the bottle
Plus I can smell it from here.
Do as you like
Everyone has their little vices
It's better to drink a little
than to sleep with young girls
One of these days
you'll end up in the papers
Whiskey is not so bad!
I didn't choose the bass tuba
It's the bass tuba that chose me
I wanted to play the trumpet, which
has always given me goose bumps
Do you remember when we were doing
military service on ships?
I used to get emotional too, but as
soon as it was over I would take off
I am very sensitive
Art makes me cry
And I'll tell you something else
- Sometimes I want to die
- Why do you want to die?
Because the world has become
a nasty place
I want to be reunited with my dad
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It's true
Then let's talk about my instrument
The fact that nobody wanted it
touched me
Poor bass tube. It was there
on its own, like a stray dog
I thought it looked a bit like me
Sad and Ionely, like me
Clumsy and fat, just like me
I thought the two of us should be
together. And that's what happened
It was a good idea,
we are meant for each other
Now I can't stay away from it.
We are friends
When I feel down,
the two of us sit by the window...
...Iook at the moon...
...and play a solo by Verdi
Do you want to hear it?
I don't mind
Yes, maybe just a little bit
With music, everyone hears
what they want to hear
Sound is subjective. For example,
an F sharp or a B flat...
...played by any instrument
can sound very moving to some...
...while others may hate them
It may well happen
What an amazing instrument
the oboe is
It's the oldest one, you know?
It was invented by the Chinese...
...and it's the most difficult...
...and most delicate
and the most solitary one
The oboes are isolated, envied...
...and disliked
Because the orchestra has to answer
to the oboe
It's the oboe that lays down the law
It's the oboe...
...that sets the pitch range
It's because of this privilege
that the violin hates the oboe
And, as you would expect...
...the oboe hates the violin
- Well...
- It's an instrument...
...that enables spiritual elevation
Those who play it...
...develop special powers
It's like an inner eye...
...that enables you to see
the colours of sound
When I play, I see...
...a bright, golden aura...
...the same colour as the sun
It's like a huge reverberation
It's true, you know? Once I saw...
...something that looked like a banner
Look, his hands are shaking
- It's an extraordinary experience
- Andy, play...
- Would you like to hear it?
- Of course
If you don't mind...
Excuse me, Sir
Just a moment.
He's having a shower
With the previous director...
...musicians wouldn't take things
so lightly
First of all,
they would all wear a tie
Nobody was allowed to show up
without a tie
Now they would even take footbaths
while playing
They also had a rule
Those who went out of tune
or didn't come in at the right time...
...had to play standing up...
...until the end of the rehearsal,
as punishment
What shifts? What working hours?
They had to rehearse all night long
Do you know how many dawns
I have seen?
At dawn, the musicians,
though exhausted...
...would applaud the director...
...and thank him
He was a genius
He would conduct with his eyes closed,
as if he was in a trance
Instead, he was very alert
I don't know how he did that
When he wanted to tell a musician off
for making a mistake...
...he would find words
that would kill you...
...that would make you feel bad
for a month
He used to give terrible blows
with his baton...
...on the hands of the musicians
who had made mistakes
You could hear so much hissing!
Well, do you want to know something?
They were happy...
...to be punished
They would come forward
like schoolchildren
They would open their hands
and say...
..."I have made a mistake"
"So have I!
I too have made a mistake!"
Those were different times
- Can you see what he is doing?
- What is he doing?
RUBBISH DIRECTOR...
- Guess!
- Do you think this is acceptable?
It probably is!
- I don't know anymore
- Zuanelli!
Here we go
The people from TV are here
Do you want to know
if music is part of the world?
I would like to ask you
if music exists
No? Then the world doesn't exist
Only habits are left
You can go
What role does music have
these days?
Do you really think the audience knows
what music is?
They think they are clever just because
they feel butterflies in their stomach
Beethoven makes everyone feel
like a knight in shining armour
I can almost picture them picking up
their chairs and running away
When I am conducting, I feel stupid
It's as if I was dead.
I feel like a ghost
I didn't mean to say that.
Please cut it out
Nowadays you have to be optimistic
all the time
I have to be clever
So let's say that
the music is the world
When I am conducting, I feel
like the world's leader, like a king
Do you really want to know how I feel?
I feel like a sergeant major who kicks
people in the backside all the time
Although these days the law forbids
you to behave like a sergeant
I am sure we have taken advantage
of our privileged position
Excuse me, I need a drink
This is not even chilled
There is no ice in the bucket
There is a fine line between talent
and eccentricity
For example, once I asked
a musician to take her ring off...
...because the reflection of the light
on the stone was bothering me
Everyone thought I was throwing
a tantrum and behaving like a diva
It may well be,
but it's the eccentricity...
...that enables an artist to have
the ability...
...to enthral and lead everyone
Cheers
But now the key role
of the director is criticised
Musicians...
I don't even look at them
I must say that
sometimes I can't stand their faces
If I could, I would put
a screen in front of some of them
They look like ferocious dogs...
...staring at me
It's best to cut this out...
...or they will shoot me
in the legs
The golden era is over
I remember the first time
I stepped on a rostrum
The thing that hit me most...
...was the complete silence
At the start signal...
...I realise that my baton...
...is connected with the orchestra
Its voice originates from my hand
The baton draws the orchestra
out of silence...
...and then back to it
The sound rises like a sea wave...
...when I lift my arm
and move it in the air like a wing...
...and when I lower it...
...the sound fades
Now we are all equal
I have to be like the first violin,
who has fingers like a butcher
What do I do about it?
I release my anger...
...and buy houses
I have two in the States...
...one in Tokyo, one in London
and one in Berlin
But not in Paris
I don't want to have one there
because I don't like French music
I think that's why
at customs at Orly...
...I get searched from top to bottom,
front and back
You've got your interview now,
are we finished? I am going to go
Orchestra conductor...
This word
doesn't mean anything anymore
An orchestra conductor
is like a priest
He needs to have
a church and parishioners
When the church collapses...
...and the parishioners
become atheists...
I remember Koplensky,
my great teacher...
At the time, I was the first violin
When he stepped on the rostrum,
everyone was silent
He would glace over the music sheets
with an absent-minded look
He knew them inside out
He was the music
We followed him with joy and fear...
...through a ritual
of transubstantiation...
...turning wine into blood...
...and bread into flesh
Are you laughing at me?
I hope not
Music is always sacred
Every concert is like a mass
We used to sit there in amazement
We would forget
about everyday worries
As we were waiting for his baton
to move...
...we were one with our instruments
We were united by a vital force
Then we would start
There was nothing more beautiful
than his authority
We used to tremble...
...at the thought...
...that one mistake could spoil
the entire ritual
It was very emotional
It was sheer joy
We felt as if our joy...
...could be conveyed
to the audience...
...who was quiet and still
We never used to look
at the conductor. We didn't need to
He was there and we knew that.
We could feel it
He was inside us
There was a close relationship between
the conductor and the musicians
Not anymore though,
as you can see
There is only mistrust
between me and my musicians
We are all against each other.
Our wariness undermines our trust
Then there is contempt, resentment...
...and anger for something
that has gone and will never come back
That's how we play together...
...united only by hatred...
...like a broken family
I don't know what's happened
but we have no electricity
- I can see that
- What shall we do?
What do you mean? The break is over.
We will carry on rehearsing
- But...
- Come on, let's go
Lead the way
Conductor,
we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting,
we will make you very sore
Conductor,
we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting,
we will make you very sore
Conductor,
we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting,
we will make you very sore
- Claudio!
- What?
You have to do something!
- Now I'll target the other eye!
- What are you doing?
Listen!
We don't want you anymore!
We won't let you conduct
We were stupid to spend
all that time studying
We spent all our life at music school
You're right
There's no need for a conductor,
no need for music, no need for nothing!
Let's throw everything
out of the window
Music should be a public good...
...that everyone can enjoy,
regardless of their social class
- Instead it's used to exploit us
- How did it happen?
Conductor,
we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting,
we will make you very sore
You're mad. What are you doing?
- Darling
- You drive me crazy
You're all sweaty
- What is this stuff coming down?
- What's going on up there?
You're ignorant
and are acting in bad faith!
- Traitor!
- You signed it too!
I'm going to report you to the union!
I'll do it straight away!
We say no to exploitation!
Music is a chain of exploitation!
We must break it!
We must break it!
Hey, take a look
What's on my head?
I felt something
What do you want from me?
Are you looking for trouble?
What do you want? It's raining!
I will not tolerate being provoked
What's this guy doing?
Look what some people can do!
He insists!
Do you want another one?
Another one?
We say no the baton!
No more conductors! We want
our music and we want it now!
You are nothing to me! Who is he?
I am asking you, who is that guy?
He doesn't exist, and if he does,
I am going to get rid of him!
Blood! You mad idiots!
Can I do my interview sitting there?
The first time I saw a harp,
it was in a dream
I must have been four or five.
Perhaps even less
I didn't know what that little golden
thing was... There is still blood
Once I saw a picture in a book
showing Rome burning and Nero...
...holding an instrument that looked
like the one from the dream
Then another time,
in a scented calendar...
...there was a flying angel
who was playing the harp
The very same one
I saw in the dream
The harp is like a human being
Let me tell you something.
I couldn't live in a house...
...where there isn't harp
I can't go to sleep if I know
it's not in the other room...
...if it's not in the living room
Sometimes I have the impression
that other hands are touching it
I can hear it being played.
Maybe it's just the wind
The harp is my whole life
Not only from a financial
point of view
It's been my shelter, my friend
I have always been on my own.
I have never had a man
Nobody. Just my harp
I talk to her
She talks back
and shares her feelings
It's an overwhelming feeling of joy...
...and sadness at the same time
But the most important thing
is that it instils faith
If you play the harp, you believe
that there are other dimensions
Once a child asked me...
..."Where does music go
when you stop playing?"
Only a child could ask such a question
Orchestra, don't fear,
the conductor's death is near!
Orchestra, don't fear,
the conductor's death is near!
Orchestra,
if you play, you betray
Orchestra, don't fear,
the conductor's death is near!
Orchestra,
if you play, you betray!
Orchestra, if you play,
you betray!
Orchestra, if you play,
you betray!
Orchestra, if you play,
you betray!
That's our new conductor!
Your time is up, conductor
give it up!
Your time is up, conductor
give it up!
Long live the metronome!
Metronome! Metronome!
Metronome! Metronome!
All musicians will finally be free!
Your time is up,
conductor give it up!
Your time is up, conductor
give it up!
Down with the metronome!
Music has its rhythm, its cadence!
We want to set them!
It is time to stop playing music
that works against us
Since we play it,
we also want to create it!
Conducting is forbidden!
We don't want anyone to direct us!
You stupid bitch!
I'll kill you!
He's going to kill us!
Are you mad? Give me that revolver!
- Give it to me!
- You're hurting me!
I have a gun permit.
It's in my wallet
- Take a look
- Let me see it
I have a gun permit
It's in his name
- It's a proper gun permit
- See? I told you I had one
Pull yourself up
Smith & Wesson?
Look!
Up there! Up there!
Hey, look!
Mario, look! It's coming down!
It's all coming down!
Help! Help!
Help me!
Clara!
Clara!
Why?
You are here
I am here
Each of you must focus
on his own instrument
It's the only thing we can do
Could anyone please help me?
Music saves us
Music saves us
Rely on the notes
Follow the notes
One after the other
Just as my hands can guide you
We are musicians
You are musicians
And we are here to rehearse
Don't be afraid.
The rehearsal goes on
Gentlemen, take your places.
Take your places, please
Thank you
Shall we make sound less colourful?
Don't forget that noise is not music
This is not a tram taking a sharp turn.
I heard the noise of pans
Where are we?
Are we at a football stadium?
Do you think I am the referee?
Brass, what are you doing?
What's happening to your small lungs?
Are you out of breath?
Did you use it all up to talk?
Play energetically!
With force! These trumpets
should wake up the dead!
This is making me fall asleep!
Are you musicians or not?
I want a sound
that has the colour of fire!
Gentlemen, let's start
at the beginning!
