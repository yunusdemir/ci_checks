- Status?
- Engine's damaged.
Twenty percent capacity. Automatic
weapons tracking system, disabled.
- David, how many left?
- Six.
Lead ship's coming around
for another pass.
- We can't let them get away.
- Repair teams are doing all they can.
Tell them to do more.
We don't break off.
Those are the rules.
We follow and we never stop.
- We live for The One, we die for The One.
- Yes, sir.
These raiders have been preying
on Alliance shipping lanes.
We have to send them a message.
Malcolm, any word on backup?
Nothing, sir. We...
In Valen's name.
Brace for impact!
Captain Gregg! Captain!
- Healer! We need a healer up here.
- The raiders are getting away.
- If we don't pursue them...
- Engine status?
Still holding at 20 percent.
We can continue the chase.
- Weapons?
- Weapons systems are off-line.
That last hit.
The only reason we are still alive
is because they do not know...
...which they have hit worse,
our engines or the weapons systems.
If it is the engines...
...coming back to finish the job
is more trouble than we're worth.
But if we try and follow
and they take just one shot at us...
...they'll know we've got nothing.
They'll blow us out of the sky
without a second thought.
Without weapons,
we don't have a chance.
- Stand down.
- No, we can...
I said, stand down.
We live for The One,
we die for The One.
But we don't die stupidly.
Send the distress signal.
Show me.
Impressive, aren't they?
"Impressive" is not exactly the word
I was searching for, G'Kar.
"Ominous," perhaps?
No. "Menacing. "
"Potentially hostile," "heavily armed,"
and "aesthetically displeasing"?
Try "unknown. "
Understand their intent,
that they are hostile or menacing...
...even ominous, is to know
something about them.
We have been a spacefaring race
for over 1 000 years...
...yet we know nothing
about this race.
It is as if they came out of nowhere.
I imagine the humans felt that way
when they first saw your ships.
- We were hardly menacing.
- Of course.
So that whole Earth-Minbari War
was just a silly rumor?
This recording
is the last thing we received...
...from one of our
long-range patrol ships.
Why the last?
The Interstellar Alliance
has one purpose:
To create peace among
its member worlds.
As new worlds join,
so the responsibility becomes greater...
...as does the amount
of space we cover.
Space contains
an infinite number of mysteries.
It appears we have awakened
one of them.
Is that why you asked me to come?
We have arranged
to meet secretly with a group...
...who may have information
concerning this new race.
You have traveled the stars more than
anyone this high up in the Alliance...
...and you have the ear
of President Sheridan.
You could be of great help to us.
I'll do whatever I can.
Discreetly, of course.
I know your reputation, G'Kar.
"Discreet" is not in your vocabulary.
So please consider any closed door
you encounter an open one.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to summon the rest of the Council.
We have an unpleasant duty
before us.
One of the Anla'shok
has acted inappropriately...
...and must be punished,
perhaps even expelled.
- What was his crime?
- Staying alive.
Curious. Until now,
I hadn't known it was a crime.
- David.
- Dulann.
I have heard that the Council
has made its decision about you.
Yeah?
It's been at least two weeks
and I sure haven't heard anything.
Minbari ears are substantially
more sensitive than human ears.
At least ours are bigger
and better placed.
- Size is not everything.
- Yeah, I've heard that before.
So I am informed.
You know, even being tossed out
would be better than this.
I should be commanding a ship
right now, not...
- Not this.
- The ways of the Council are wise.
They felt that a menial task such as this
would calm your mind...
...clear your thoughts of distractions.
Water.
More quickly this time.
Think they'd consider it a distraction
if I belted Tannier?
I noticed you left
your right side exposed again.
That's fine if you stick
with traditional moves.
But not everybody plays
by the same rules.
Try something new once in a while.
Something new?
Such as running away?
I just love it when you get
all self-righteous and stuff.
It makes your head bone quiver
right back here.
You retreated from a combat zone.
You violated the principles of combat
at the very core of the Anla'shok.
You weren't there. We were.
It was David's responsibility...
To uphold the Ranger code.
The weapons were down.
What were we supposed to do?
Look mean and hope
the bad guys surrendered?
Sarah, you know as much
about ship weapons as anyone...
...but despite your training, you still
don't know what it is to be one of us.
Still, in the end,
the decision was his, not yours.
I have no quarrel with you.
- Maybe not, but I've got one with you...
- Sarah, Malcolm, that's enough.
I won't have you getting
in trouble on my behalf.
This situation calls for
a calm mind and clear thoughts.
- Am I right, Dulann?
- Yes.
So there you are.
Now go on.
And once again, he runs from a fight.
And we're not supposed to do that,
are we, Tannier?
Like I said, you should really watch
your right side.
You know, you're right.
This job has completely calmed my mind.
So, what do you think of the Valen?
They say it's faster
than anything in the fleet.
Yeah, sure. I suppose.
You know, things in space
don't have to be aerodynamic.
You could put an engine on a brick,
looks like what they've done...
...and it would be fast, but...
- You're just mad because...
- Sorry, I didn't...
- That's okay.
Maybe it would've been my ship,
maybe it wouldn't have.
The Valen is fresh off the assembly line.
It needs a captain.
- You were next up...
- No, you don't know that.
They would've given it to Tannier even if
things hadn't gone wrong on the Enfali.
The stupid, annoying thing is that,
for years...
...ever since I heard of the Rangers
and the Alliance, I wanted to join up.
Be part of something
bigger than myself, you know?
Make a difference.
That was my dream
ever since my folks died.
After they were gone,
I got shuttled around a lot.
Never really felt like
I belonged anywhere, you know.
I guess I retreated. I read.
I fell in love with legends,
ancient histories...
...Greek and African mythologies
from Earth...
...Centauri mythologies
and their household gods.
With 1 000 known worlds,
it never ends.
That was when I first heard
of the Rangers...
...the Anla'shok,
out there on the edge...
...creating the future like
King Arthur and his knights.
A thousand years of history,
philosophy, tradition.
Practically a myth on their own.
God, I so wanted to be a part of that.
Hey. They won't throw you out,
not for this.
Maybe. Maybe. We'll see.
Is that the Liandra?
I can't believe she's still flying.
Word is, her last crew died onboard.
Nobody knows who or what
killed them.
They couldn't even find
the ship for a week.
It just fell off the charts.
It's been through hell, that's for sure.
Some folks think she's cursed.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Well, I guess I'd better get ready.
The Council will be calling
for me soon.
Listen, Sarah...
...if this doesn't go well...
- It will.
But if it doesn't...
...I want you to know you're one
of the best people we've got.
It was a pleasure serving
with you on the Enfali.
It would have been an honor
serving alongside you again...
...even if it was on a flying brick.
David, as a wise man said:
"We live for The One,
we die for The One. "
And as another wise man said,
"It ain't over till it's over. "
Dulann, what...?
You shouldn't be here.
I am your friend.
Where else should I be?
You know this could be trouble.
When you are involved,
I expect nothing less.
I must make them understand that there
is nothing to be gained by expelling you.
Well, you'd get my room.
It has a better view than yours.
A point I had not considered.
Step into the circle, David Martell,
and prepare to receive judgment.
If I may, I would like to offer
a statement on behalf of my friend.
Go on.
With great respect
for the honored Council...
...if David Martell is expelled from
the Anla'shok, I will go with him...
...as will Sarah Cantrell
and Malcolm Bridges.
Dulann, don't do this.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
It was their wish to stand with you.
And mine.
Dulann, the ways of our order
were created for a reason.
They are not to be set aside lightly.
David gave the order to stand down
not to save his own life...
...but to save the lives of his captain,
his crew and the ship itself.
His concern was for us,
not for himself.
I know.
I saw it in his soul.
We all know that you are blessed
by being sensitive to such things.
No one questions that.
But his motives change nothing.
Anla'shok David Martell,
it is the judgment of this council...
...that you violated
our most sacred principle:
That we do not break away
from combat.
That we do not retreat,
whatever the reason.
So it is with great personal sadness
and reluctance...
...that I remove you...
- May I also speak?
You said I should consider
any closed door open, so I did.
This situation caught my interest...
...and I decided to look into it.
As I understand it,
this human is here today...
...because he chose to preserve
the lives of his crew...
...instead of fighting an impossible battle
and getting them all killed...
...a violation of Minbari tradition.
That is correct.
We live for The One,
we die for The One. All that.
Yes.
Interesting that you place
all your emphasis...
...on the second half
of that sentence.
Is it not just as honorable
to live for The One as it is to die?
It doesn't just say "we die. "
It says "we live. "
Dying is not honorable.
It only relieves you
of an even greater obligation.
His actions have led
other Rangers into dissension.
Indeed. They put their lives
and their careers at risk for his sake.
I've met very few who can foster
that kind of loyalty.
One in particular comes to mind.
Stubborn, difficult, fractious...
...annoying, independent and willful.
And what happened to him?
He became the president
of this Alliance...
...of which the Anla'shok is part.
In fact, I just spoke with him
a few moments ago.
Would you all like to hear
what we discussed?
It may have some bearing on another
topic we discussed earlier, Sindell.
The Council will recess to hear
this new information.
Pretty, isn't it?
Not as nice as my homeworld,
of course, but still quite nice.
- Are they...?
- Finished? Yes.
There was a great deal of
heated discussion, but the result is this:
You may remain with the Anla'shok,
and you will be given a ship.
G'Kar, what did you tell them?
- Four true things.
- That's all?
You try finding one true thing
in this economy.
- That's not...
- What I said is of no consequence...
...at least not yet.
Just prove me right.
How can I prove it if I don't
even know what it is?
There, you see? Another truth.
David, accept the miracle and move on.
Funny thing.
This place is all about hope.
Truth is, I'd pretty much
given up, until...
- Thank you, G'Kar.
- Don't thank me yet.
The Council isn't giving you
command of the Valen.
For you, the Council has chosen
a slightly different vessel.
Not... Not the Liandra?
The ship that went missing,
whose crew was killed?
The ship everybody says is cursed?
That Liandra, you ask?
Yes, that Liandra.
I'll take it.
What the hell was I thinking?
The thing's had the crap kicked
out of it at least a dozen times.
You don't solve problems
by hitting them.
Yeah, well, it made me feel better.
- How old is she, anyway?
- In human terms, 20 years.
The lines and colors are representative
of the Shu-Nali sense of design.
Until recently, we strove for
a certain aesthetic in our ships...
...a design both lethal,
yet pleasing to the eye.
Then humans became involved
in designing ships for the Alliance.
Oh, so you're blaming us
for how the Valen looks?
If human military designers
had their way...
...every color of the spectrum
would be removed...
...except for gray, green and black...
...and we would all live
in windowless boxes.
I see. You trying to start another war?
Humans start wars.
Minbari finish them.
Then why don't you finish
checking this section...
...while I start finding out
how bad things are on the bridge.
By the way, I understand Tannier was
given command of the Valen today.
Was that your head?
How ever did that happen?
Come up here and I'll show you.
Sold us out!
Son of a bitch sold us out!
Get us the hell out of here.
We're losing pressure on all decks.
We're gonna die, sir!
There's no way out.
Dulann? Hey, Dulann.
I was calling you from the bridge.
When you didn't answer, I figured...
You okay?
Yes, I'm...
I'm fine. I'm fine.
All right.
Well, I checked the ship's records...
...to see what happened
to her crew. Nothing.
The records must have been wiped
by whatever happened.
They suffocated.
The ship was holed
beyond their capacity to repair it.
They tried to get back to safety...
...but they ran out of air.
How do you know that?
They're still here.
I heard about the Council's decision.
I suppose congratulations are in order.
They gave me command
of the Valen, you know.
It's a fine ship.
A bit larger than I'm used to,
but I'll adapt.
It's a great responsibility.
I've been assigned my first mission.
Transporting a group of Alliance
dignitaries to a security meeting.
They haven't told me why yet,
or where, but...
Anyway, to avoid drawing attention...
...they've decided to limit me
to just one escort ship.
I told them I want the Liandra.
They agreed.
Why me?
Why the Liandra?
Would it be rubbing my nose
in the fact that you got the better ship?
Do you think me so small that I would
take pleasure in your situation?
We depart at dawn
in three days' time.
Have the rest of your crew selected
and ready to leave...
...or I'll find someone else.
The command staff are assembled
on the bridge, awaiting your inspection.
You're sure these
are the ones you wanted?
Yes. Why?
There is a Narn
and a Drazi out there.
The Narn and the Drazi are the most
recent members of the Alliance.
These are the first recruits
we got from them.
They've been waiting for a ship
nearly as long as I have.
I'm not saying there's any lack
of ethnic understanding around here...
...but every time a ship is staffed,
it's always either Minbari or human.
They have not yet absorbed the
quiet core of what it is to be Anla'shok.
They are intemperate.
So am I.
No one else will give them a chance.
It may as well be me.
As you wish.
Tannier came to see me
the other day.
I couldn't tell if he was being an ass
or trying to apologize.
Knowing Tannier, it could very well
have been both at the same time.
So here I am feeling bad.
Why should I feel bad when he was
the one saying I should be tossed out?
Tannier believes
in the decisions of the Council.
If the Council has absolved you, then he
must believe it was the correct decision...
...because the Council
cannot be mistaken.
It is not for him to decide
whether to believe in you or not.
He believes in the cause,
and that is enough.
So you're saying I should apologize
for shutting him out?
I'm saying that...
That the crew are waiting
to begin the welcome ceremony.
The rest is between you...
...and you.
Some of you have served
with me before.
It's an honor to see you again.
The rest of you...
...I chose based on reports from
the Council and my own observations.
To all of you, welcome aboard.
You may proceed
with the naming of names.
This star reminds us
that we are born of the stars.
We live in starlight,
we die in starlight.
We come from the stars in life,
and we return to the stars in death.
When we are done, this star shall
be placed in the heart of the ship...
...where it shall remain
for as long as we do.
Your name, your place, your truth.
Sarah Cantrell of Mars, weapons
and tactical-combat specialist.
I live to serve, I serve to live.
Tafeek of Minbar,
political and first-contact specialist.
I come to the stars
by a difficult road.
Kitaro Sasaki of Earth.
Navigations, communications,
and translation specialist.
I'm just really glad to be here, sir.
Firell of Minbar, healer.
My heart speaks quietly
and infrequently.
Malcolm Bridges of Beta Colony.
Infiltration and
covert-operations specialist.
In dreams, I never see my face.
Na'Feel of Narn.
Engines, environment,
and weapons support.
I understand nobody else
would have me.
Tirk. Drazi.
I carry very large things.
I...
I...
Tirk. Drazi.
Dulann of Minbar.
Shok-nali. First officer.
My life for the Shok-na.
David Martell.
No place in particular.
Shok-na. Captain.
I'm looking for something.
We are Rangers.
We walk in the dark places
no others will enter.
We stand on the bridge,
and no one may pass.
We live for The One.
We die for The One.
Com system's acting up.
We barely got ship-to-ship.
I'll go you one better.
The engines don't work.
The what?
Toe-sucking spawn
of a bladder fish!
- Son of a fish, piece of smelt!
- Na'Feel?
Yes, captain?
- The engines...
- Just a little fine-tuning.
We'll be ready when you are.
- You're sure?
- Of course.
- Why would you think otherwise?
- I just...
Good. That's good, Na'Feel.
As you were.
Tok-swallowing fenbarger!
Twenty credits say
we blow up on the ground.
- You are so covered.
- Thrak it!
David, I was trying to reach you.
Is there a problem?
No, no. No problem, Tannier.
The ship is in such great shape
that some of the crew didn't think...
...another prelaunch check
was necessary, but I figured...
...you know, what the hell?
Let's kill time while you're
getting all the diplomats onboard.
Good. Then we are ready to depart.
Absolutely.
After you, Tannier.
Today's a good day to die.
Oh, with you, every day's
a good day to die.
We're ready to go.
Initiate jumpgate sequence.
Thirty credits.
Hit it.
Stand by to jump.
A lot of work for a milk run,
but at least we're on our way.
A milk run?
A no-brainer.
Escorting a bunch of diplomats on
a joyride to some conference or other.
But since we're still trying
to get this crate fully operational...
...it's probably a good thing we're not
getting into a fight with anybody.
We've nearly reached
our destination.
Thanks for finally letting me know.
I'm sorry, but it was necessary
to keep the location secret...
...for security reasons.
We didn't even tell the diplomats where
we were going until a few minutes ago.
Based on my readings,
we're near Beta Durani 7.
That is correct.
Tell your people to get ready to jump.
Something I don't understand.
Why come all this way for a meeting?
I mean, everybody was already
assembled back on Minbar.
Why not have the meeting there?
Maybe they wanted the diplomats to see
something they couldn't transport.
Beta Durani 7 is a domed colony,
roughly 600 people.
It's an archaeological dig.
What does a security meeting
have to do with an archaeological dig?
I don't know.
But I guess we'll find out.
Prepare to jump.
I've got an energy spike.
Jump point forming at 6:00.
Evasive maneuvers.
Weapons, prepare to fire.
Telemetry online.
Ocular targeting enabled.
Weapons, ready to fire.
Fire at will.
No.
Direct hit. Colony destroyed.
Get those people out.
We'll cover you.
It's too late!
Bring us about.
Put us between the Valen...
...and the enemy.
- Coming about.
I got you, you son of a...
Oh, no.
Dulann!
Valen to Liandra.
Do you receive? Do you receive?
- We're here. What's your status?
- Engines are hit.
We can barely maneuver.
Rear decks are on fire.
Captain, two of the enemy ships
are moving away.
We hit one of them.
They may be trying to go for repairs.
Or they know it'll only take one of them
to finish us off. Can you engage?
Weapons are at 1 0 percent,
not enough to do any damage.
- Engines?
- Functional, but barely.
I've ordered the diplomats
into the escape pods.
I want you to pick them up
and get them to safety.
Captain, I've got a clear shot
of the enemy.
You said you didn't
have enough to do any damage.
We don't, but if I can send a burst
up the engines, we can cripple her.
Take your best shot.
David, weapons systems are gone.
Nothing left.
- They're powering up.
- We can get between...
Not in time. There's only
one way to stop them now.
Full power to engines.
Don't do this. You've got time
to get to the escape pods.
The least we could do
is buy you some time to get away.
Full burn.
We live for The One...
...we die for The One.
Navigation...
...set course to intercept those pods
and grapple them aboard.
Use the engine repair bay,
since it has a big air lock.
Yes, sir.
What about com systems?
Tachyon communications are off-line.
We've got short-range ship-to-ship.
That's it.
I'm working on it now,
but I'm not holding out any hope.
Jump engines are down.
We can navigate in normal space,
but only about half-speed.
Do the best you can.
When the enemy ship doesn't report in
they're gonna look for it...
...and us.
We need to put as much space
between us and them as we can.
Tafeek, go with her.
We're gonna have hysterical diplomats
with nowhere to put them.
Do what you can to calm them down.
Take us in.
I must return to my home planet.
Will you make that happen?
Yes, yes, we'll make
every possible effort.
No, the captain
is not available just now.
We don't have
any first-class accommodation.
However, we do have
several long hallways...
...and a number of very nice closets.
Nonsense! This is an outrage!
- How is he?
- Concussion.
Injuries to half a dozen
internal organs...
...internal bleeding.
I can sustain him, but not for long.
He needs more than I can do here.
We have to get him
to a proper medical facility.
Ship.
Everything's under control.
The ship's fine.
We're just heading to safe water...
...so we can get you
the treatment that you need.
We're not in hyperspace.
I could feel it if we were.
No. No, we're not.
Taking the scenic route?
Something like that.
It'll be okay, Dulann.
We'll make it, and so will you.
I had a dream...
...about the last crew of the Liandra.
They were fighting to get home.
Lost, alone.
They are not at peace here, David.
Something here is disturbing them.
They're probably worried
about you joining them.
Hell, if I found out you were moving
to my place, I'd be pissed too.
But we're gonna disappoint them,
because you're gonna be just fine.
- Anyway, I should get back to the...
- No.
You don't understand.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what's disturbed them.
All I know is...
...something is wrong.
- Son of a bitch sold us out.
- The bastard sold us out.
That bastard sold us out!
The bastard sold us out!
I couldn't get out...
...to where the air was.
I never saw his face.
And we need you to speak
to the captain on our behalf, G'Kar.
He is needlessly endangering us.
I am sure there must be a planet...
...with a breathable atmosphere
somewhere in this sector.
He could land, drop us off,
and get help.
Minister Kafta, this ship
is being held together...
...by little pieces of wire
and good intentions.
If we land in this condition,
assuming we don't have...
...an unpleasant encounter
with the ground on the way down...
...I doubt they could take off again.
They would be trapped with us.
The ship looking for them...
...would find it, find them,
find us, find you.
A brilliant cascade
of cause-and-effect.
Isn't the universe an amazing place?
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
Citizen G'Kar, Captain Martell
would like to speak with you.
Of course. Love to stay. Can't.
Have to go. Kiss-kiss, love-love. Bye.
I sometimes think
that prolonged exposure to humans...
...has driven him mad.
You should be careful.
Yes.
Your name is Tirk, isn't it?
That isn't a Drazi name.
My mother created it.
She says it means:
"Don't touch me. I'm not having
another child after this, ever. "
That is a great deal of meaning
to put into such a short name.
They must be very, very proud of you.
Yes.
You wanted to see me, captain?
G'Kar, yes. Please, come in.
You were a military tactician
before becoming an ambassador.
- I'd like your thoughts.
- Whatever I can do to help.
I've been reviewing
the enemy attack...
...and something is bothering me.
When the enemy jumped out,
they targeted the Valen's engines first.
Then they blew the hell out
of Beta Durani 7...
...hit our weapons,
then they hesitated.
Do you see anything wrong
with this picture?
In combat, you destroy
the biggest ship first...
...by targeting the weapons array,
since they're fairly volatile.
You only go for the engines
as a last resort...
...since they're heavily shielded to keep
radiation from affecting the crew.
Exactly. As if they were trying to cripple
the Valen instead of destroying it.
Perhaps they wanted
to capture us alive.
That would explain the hesitation...
...waiting for us to get
to the escape pods...
...find out how much we know.
How much you know
about what, G'Kar?
G'Kar, why were you coming here
in the first place?
Who are these people?
If we're gonna survive, we have
to know what we're up against.
That's what we
were hoping to find out.
Until recently, all we knew
was that ships...
...identical to the ones
that attacked us...
...are trying to destabilize the Alliance
by attacking its weaker members.
Then we learned that information
relevant to this new race...
...had been found at an
archaeological dig at Beta Durani 7.
Which was?
Every spacefaring race
has two things in common.
First, they all have a food...
...identical to what humans call
"Swedish meatballs. "
Don't ask. I don't understand it.
It's just there.
And they all share a myth
about a time...
...when ancient dark forces
prowled the universe...
...only to be cast down
or cast away...
...by an even greater force,
a force of light.
Until recently,
I assumed that's all it was, myths.
Then...
...we received this recording from the
archaeological team at Beta Durani 7.
They found a city eight miles
beneath the surface of the planet.
A city billions of years old.
Older than anything found before.
According to the hieroglyphs...
...this city was built
by an ancient race...
...that drove off the forces
of darkness a billion years ago.
They indicate that the enemy
was driven from normal space...
...into a place of eternal darkness.
- A parallel dimension?
- It's possible.
The translators were
still working on the rest of it.
At first, they weren't sure
how much to believe.
Then...
...they found this.
What the hell is that?
A door.
To another place.
Another space.
We sent a probe through that door.
It came back changed...
...distorted beyond recognition.
The hieroglyphs warned of a time
when the enemy might return.
We have reason to believe
there is a connection between this...
...and the ships that attacked us.
And I can assure you that
the entire situation is well in hand.
I'll be back soon
with more information.
It'll all be just...
Fine.
Sorry.
Tafeek said the other diplomats
were starting to panic...
...talking about getting
in the escape pods...
...and taking their chances outside.
We tried to find you, but no one...
...knew where you...
You see, I'm with
covert operations...
...which is why I have the holo-suit,
and sometimes it's necessary to...
To...
- I think I'll be going now.
- Excellent idea.
What's our status?
Weapons are up to
25-percent capacity.
About enough to take out a big rock.
It's a start. You never know
when you'll be attacked...
...by somebody with a big rock.
- We've got company.
Routing it to your system.
Have they seen us yet?
Engines are running
so far below normal...
...it's getting lost in the electromagnetic
noise generated by the local star.
It's only a matter of time
before they find us.
There's only three options in combat:
Run, fight or hide.
We can't run. We can't fight.
That leaves hide.
Can you bring us in close
to that comet?
Put us right inside the tail?
It'll be bumpy.
We're talking explosive gas jets...
...melting ice, chunks of rock
being knocked off by steam venting...
...but yeah, I can do it.
Some chunks of rock and ice
can be as big as we are.
- I should be running weapons in case.
- Understand that if you fire...
...the enemy will see the energy spike.
They'll come in right after us.
That's the chance we'll have to take.
Get us inside, Kit.
Sarah, you'll only have a few seconds
to ID a ship-killer and take it out...
...so I'll leave it up to you.
Just don't fire unless you think
you absolutely have to, okay?
Shouldn't have made that joke
about taking out a rock.
By the way,
about the naming ceremony earlier.
"I live to serve, I serve to live. "
You say that every time. That's pretty
lame, as far as your truth goes.
Yeah, well, it's about as revealing
as I want to get in this lifetime.
See you on the other side of hell.
It's okay, Sarah.
Just sign up with the Liandra.
I'm sure they just exaggerated
that part about the ship being cursed.
Oh, somebody
just shoot me in the head.
Oh, crap.
- Sarah...
- It's gonna miss us.
It's gonna miss us.
I'm reasonably sure
it's gonna miss us.
Oh, jeez.
We've got damage to the hull.
Losing air pressure
in aft compartments.
- If we stay here, we'll decompress.
- Any sign of the enemy?
I can't tell from inside here.
We'll have to go out.
All right.
We'll have to take our chances.
Move us away.
Any sign of pursuit?
Enemy ship moved away
on an oblique angle.
- We're clear.
- Captain?
Yes, Firell?
There's a problem.
First Officer Dulann is missing.
What? What do you...?
What do you want?
And when we came back,
Dulann was simply gone.
Did he say anything before that?
Anything at all?
Nothing more
than what he said to you.
That something is wrong...
...and that the spirits of this ship
do not rest easy.
What happened to kill
the last crew...
...is less of an issue than keeping
this one alive. And I simply don't buy...
Look, I've known Dulann
for over three years.
I know he's slightly telepathic...
...but I don't buy this whole bit
about sensing the dead.
Minbari are sensitive to such things.
Telepaths, even minor ones
like Dulann...
...are more sensitive still.
And when one of our kind
is near death...
...the veil becomes very thin indeed.
Perhaps what has stirred
the dead here...
...has some relevance
to our current situation.
We, like they, are facing the possibility
we may never arrive home.
- Perhaps...
- Captain.
- Any word on Dulann?
- No.
I've got every crewman
I can spare searching the ship.
He has to be here someplace.
We'll find him.
- Anything new at your end?
- Possibly. It's just a thought.
Right now, a thought would be good.
Thank you, Firell.
Come on.
What's up?
I tried to work up an analysis
of the ships pursuing us...
...but I'm getting nowhere because
something doesn't make sense.
Why chase us at all?
The colony's gone.
That news will get out
whether we're alive or dead.
And since the meeting was about them,
it narrows down the list of suspects.
So why put in all this time
and effort chasing us down?
Maybe they think we saw
something during the attack...
...that we could use against them.
That's one possibility.
Here's another.
Maybe it's not information.
Maybe we have something
we don't know we have.
Bridge to captain.
- Yes?
- They've found Dulann.
Stay away. Get away from me.
It's me. Dulann, it's me, David.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just come with me back to...
No. Listen.
You don't understand.
They're in me.
They're inside my head.
Dulann, listen to me.
Your bloodstream is becoming toxic
the longer you're out of Medbay.
- What you're hearing isn't real.
- No. Listen.
Someone sold them out,
betraying them.
Now they feel the same
happening again.
Dulann, that's not possible.
Everyone here was either on the Liandra
or the Valen when the attack started.
No. Check the records.
Dulann, all of the records
were erased.
Private...
...encoded log...
...not on the main system.
No one could find it.
No one knew to erase it.
Code word...
Code word...
...Entil'Zha.
Healer! I need a healer in here, stat!
Com system?
Still down.
Weapons?
Still down.
Captain?
Definitely down.
Ship.
Check all records for encrypted files.
Password required.
Entil'Zha.
We can get that out of the way
and concentrate...
Record found.
Show me.
Not much time left.
Locked in as soon
as the first attack hit.
We're running out of air.
I don't know who sold us out.
I didn't see his face.
Avenge us.
We cannot rest until we are avenged.
Whoever survives us...
...is the one who killed us.
We never gave up.
We live for The One.
We...
Dulann was right.
Maybe so...
...but what does that have to do
with our situation?
He said there was a traitor
onboard then...
...and one aboard now.
He was right about the first.
Maybe he's right again.
It can't be the same guy.
Nobody here was on the Liandra...
...when the first crew was killed.
- No.
But maybe it's enough
there is a traitor onboard.
Not that it's the same traitor.
When those ships
attacked the Valen...
...they deliberately avoided
hitting the weapons array.
They could have taken it out
immediately, but they didn't.
They waited.
But for what?
The escape pods.
They must have had
someone onboard. A mole.
Exactly. Nobody but Tannier knew where
we were going till before we got there.
A mole could've sent a signal
to bring the enemy.
They could've been shadowing us...
...just beyond scanner range,
waiting for the signal.
Check the com records
from the minute we jumped out...
...until those ships attacked us.
Look for any unusual signal.
You should not be here.
I am sorry.
It is easy to get
turned around in here.
I take it from the equipment...
...that all the high-powered relays
go through this section.
That is why you should not be here.
You could be injured.
Of course.
Captain, I've found something
in the com record. Listen.
It came in on a subchannel.
Auto-recorders confirm
it's from the Valen. We...
- What is it?
- We're getting that same signal again.
Amplified, strong enough to penetrate
the overflow from the main com system.
- Where's it coming from?
- Cargo Bay 4.
We can't put it on the PA,
we'll scare him.
You stay here, jam the signals.
You come with me.
Malcolm, you go that way.
Come through the back.
We'll catch him in between.
- What the...?
- David?
I just saw Kafta in the passage
leading to the escape pods.
I'll check it out. Keep going.
Pick up whoever else you can
along the way.
Hey, this area's off-limits.
Hey, I said...
Escape pod standing by.
Tirk.
- We need a healer, fast.
- Kafta.
It was Kafta.
Oh, crap. David.
Escape pod activated.
- David, are you okay?
- Yeah.
Stick him in a holding cell
until he wakes up.
Something else. Tirk's been shot.
They're bringing him to Medbay now.
- What about the signal?
- It was still sending.
Malcolm disconnected it
from the power relays.
Let's hope we can jam it enough
to keep it from going far.
- Bridge to captain.
- Yeah?
It looks like the signal got through.
We've got company.
Confirm one enemy ship
at 1 0,000 kilometers and closing.
Outside maximum effective range
for high-energy weapons.
The other one probably isn't far.
- What's the weapons status?
- Thirty percent of maximum.
It'll have to do.
I feel like a jackrabbit.
In, out, in, out.
Engines?
Eighty percent of maximum.
You can thank me later.
I'll do that.
- Distance to jumpgate?
- At this speed...
...two hours, maybe three.
All right, so we're back
to three choices.
Run, fight or hide.
There's nowhere to hide,
there's no weapons to speak of...
...so we run.
Na'Feel, I need you
to give me everything you've got.
If they jump to hyperspace,
they'll overshoot us.
There's only so fast
you can travel in normal space.
Pour it on and let's hope
we get to the jumpgate...
...before they close the distance.
I've got an energy spike.
Enemy ship is preparing to fire.
Beam spread reduced the impact
to 1 0 percent of effective strength.
Closer it gets,
the stronger the hits will become.
Until they achieve
hull-breaching capacity.
We've got another spike.
What the hell is that?
Evasive maneuvers.
- Mines! Come about!
- No time.
- Sarah, clear the road.
- I'm on it.
- We're clear.
- Yes! Good shooting, Sarah.
Thanks.
- Launch countermeasures.
- Launching.
Even with countermeasures, that hit with
5 percent more energy than the last one.
Correction, 1 0 percent
and building fast.
Twenty-five percent. Estimate we're
a few more shots away from a kill.
We're not gonna make it.
We can't even slow them down.
Maybe we can.
- Bridge to Malcolm.
- Right here.
- You still have that signal device?
- Right here.
Drop it into an escape pod...
...with a remote-controlled
detonation cap and launch it.
Move, move, move!
The ambassador tried to escape...
...into one of the pods
when I stopped him.
He told them
what he was planning to do...
...so when they see the pod launch,
they'll think it's him.
We're all set down here.
Launch escape pod!
Come on.
Go for it, you son of a bitch.
Stand by.
Stand by.
Stand by.
Wait for it.
Now!
Bring us back on course.
Captain, there's something
you should know.
That last hit overloaded
the weapons system.
- How long until...?
- We can't repair the weapons...
...unless we bring the ship
into docking for repairs.
From this point on,
we're completely defenseless.
Okay, here's the deal.
There's one more
enemy ship out there.
Tell me who they are
and how to beat them...
...and maybe you'll walk out
of this room in one piece.
How to beat them?
Beat them?
You really don't have
the slightest idea...
...of what you're up against, do you?
What I know is that your people
only recently joined the Alliance...
...that you're on the fringe
of Alliance territory...
...and none of your ships
have been bothered.
I'm thinking maybe
you made a deal...
...and as part of that deal...
...you joined up to spy on us
for the other side.
What do you think?
I think...
...that I have absolutely
nothing to say to you.
Let's try this again.
Who are they? What do they want?
- It won't do you any good.
- I'm not gonna say it again.
If you don't give me what I want,
there's no reason to keep you alive.
Rangers don't murder in cold blood.
Yeah, well, lately,
I've been having disciplinary problems.
We live for The One,
we die for The One.
- If I go, you go!
- Enough!
Enough.
What are we dealing with
and who are they?
They do not have a name
as you understand the concept.
They are called the Hand.
The hand of God,
the hand of Death.
The hand that reaches forth
and blots out whole suns.
They have left a thousand worlds
in their wake...
...blackened cinders
that were once thriving planets.
For millions of years,
they have been outcast...
...hungrily staring out across
the darkness between the stars...
...searching for a way back,
and now they have found it.
The ships that are after us,
are they the Hand?
Those?
Those are only toys given
to those races who serve the Hand...
...as I serve the Hand.
Together...
...we will prepare the way
for their return.
And part of preparing involves
selling out the Alliance? Is that it?
Because we could oppose them?
If you had seen what I had seen,
you would have done the same!
Compared to the Hand...
...the Shadows who straddled
the galaxy on legs of fire...
...during the Shadow War
were nothing more than insects.
If they're so powerful...
...why are they interested in you?
You must be small change
as far as they're concerned.
The Hand rewards loyalty.
It is their only virtue.
And they do not know
what I know of their plans...
...so they cannot allow
my return to Minbar...
...where I could
be questioned further.
They are coming, captain.
You cannot stop them.
You cannot fight them.
You cannot defeat them.
You can only join them...
...or be ground into dust before them.
Sarah, destination is in sight.
Repeat, I can see the jumpgate.
We're gonna make it.
What? Let me see.
Oh, my God.
We did it.
Oh, no. It isn't fair.
It isn't fair!
It's just sitting there,
like a spider in a web.
Why not? They know we've got
no place else to go.
If we try and run, they'll catch us.
And run where?
There's no jumpgate
for two light-months.
Captain, I'm picking up a holographic
signal from the enemy ship.
They want to talk.
Put them through.
This is Captain David Martell
of the Ranger attack ship Liandra.
- Identify yourself. What...?
- You will release your prisoner...
...or be destroyed.
Well, he likes to get straight
to the point, doesn't he?
Destroy us and you don't get
the prisoner.
It seems, I don't know,
counterproductive.
Instructions
were to exert every effort...
...to reclaim the prisoner
to avoid questioning.
This has already cost us
more than anticipated.
Release him to us
and you may leave this place alive.
That solution is preferred
by those we serve.
But if destroying your ship
is the only way to prevent him...
...from being questioned further,
we will do so.
- I'm sure there must be some other...
- There can be no negotiation.
We await your decision.
You're sure we have no weapons?
No weapons at all?
Nothing. But if you want,
I'll put on a breather suit...
...zip out an airlock
and throw rocks at them.
I'm game if you are.
We're not gonna give up, are we?
I mean, not after all this.
You must know they won't let us
leave here alive...
...even if we do turn over
the prisoner. I wouldn't.
Well, it's tactically unwise.
I'm going outside.
I need some fresh air.
There's nothing outside
but hard vacuum.
Typical.
David.
Hey.
I was out for a walk, thought I'd stop in
and see how you're doing.
She says I'm dying.
Other than that, not too bad.
How are things with you?
We're...
Everything's just fine, Dulann.
Nothing to worry about
except hanging in...
...until we get you to a real hospital.
How curious.
I was under the impression that
we were trapped without weapons...
...facing imminent destruction
unless we turned over the prisoner.
- Dulann, how did you know that?
- They told me.
Right.
So, what are you going to do?
Dulann, I don't know.
I mean, it's like the Enfali
all over again.
No weapons, our engines are failing,
we're outgunned...
No, not like Enfali.
We were outnumbered
and outgunned.
But there is just the one ship, yes?
Yes.
But, Dulann...
...I've used every trick that I know of
just to keep us alive this far.
I've got nothing left.
Then perhaps that is what
you should use.
- Nothing?
- Yes.
As in I've got nothing new to use?
- Exactly.
- Dulann, that's not...
Enlightenment.
I'll see you later.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Malcolm, just the man
I'm looking for.
In light of the demands,
make arrangements with the prisoner.
- What are we gonna do?
- Give them exactly what they want.
Kit, open up a channel
to the enemy ship.
Yes, sir.
We've made our decision.
We will agree to turn the prisoner
over to you in exchange...
...for safe passage
for myself and my crew.
- What?
- David, don't do this.
There's no other way,
nothing we can do.
Where is the prisoner now?
I've asked one of my crewmen
to escort him to the escape pod.
He should be launching any time.
We know what you did
to our sister ship.
We will scan the pod to ensure
that Minister Kafta is aboard...
...and that there are no
remote-controlled devices onboard...
...and we will make contact with him
once he is clear of your vessel.
If any one of these precautions
indicate trickery...
Understood.
Escape pod is launching.
They're scanning the pod.
Keep the pod directly
between us and the alien ship.
Well, they won't shoot at us
as long as he's between us.
They're opening up a com channel.
I am safe.
It is as we thought.
They have no stomach for death.
Now, please take me aboard.
I grow weary of their presence.
You have done well.
Our scan of the pod...
...confirms that you have followed
our instructions to the letter.
Of course.
What would be the point
in trying anything else?
A race as advanced as yours...
...there's no way you'd fall
for the same gag twice.
- Now, about our safe passage.
- Stand by.
For a moment there,
I thought you came up...
...with some kind of angle
I just couldn't figure out.
But your angle was to give them
what they wanted.
Yes, it was.
Okay, I'm parking the ship right here
and we're not leaving...
...until somebody tells me
what the hell just happened here.
Back on Earth...
...there were two train robbers
in the North American West...
...Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.
They came up with a great idea.
Rob a train, wait two days...
...then rob the same train all over again
in exactly the same way.
Because nobody ever figured they'd
pull the same gag twice in a row.
Since we had nothing left to pull,
I thought we'd try the same thing.
Since they were gonna
scan the pod...
...we couldn't put any large,
remote-controlled detonators inside...
...so I borrowed about
50 grenades from the armory.
And Kafta?
He was responsible for the death
of over 1 000 people...
...onboard the Valen
and Beta Durani 7.
He wanted to join his associates.
He did.
So that's why you wanted me to keep
the ship on a straight line with the pod.
So they'd think the transmission
was coming from the pod.
They know what we did last time...
...and they knew that we knew
that they knew.
So they made the logical assumption
that we wouldn't dare try it again.
And you didn't tell us this...
Because I wanted
your reactions to be sincere.
They were.
Kit...
...take us through the gate.
- Put us on a beacon for Minbar.
- Yes, sir.
It's been a damn long day.
Your actions aboard the Liandra
are to be commended.
My actions onboard the Liandra
were born out of desperation.
I'm not proud of them.
I keep going over it in my head...
...thinking I could have done
something more...
...found some other way.
We all ask such questions.
Upon learning what happened...
...I wondered, had we been
less harsh with you...
...had you been allowed to command
the Valen instead of Tannier...
...would the same thing
have happened?
Tannier acted honorably.
He gave his life
to buy us time to get away.
He did as well as anyone could have
done under the circumstances.
As did you.
Those are important words, David.
"Under the circumstances. "
We do the best we can
with what we are given.
We are imperfect reflections
of the universe around us.
We cannot change the past,
we can only learn from it...
...and try to create a future
in which such errors do not recur.
Sadly, we're still working
on that last part.
I guess the question now is,
where do we go from here?
Figured I'd find you up here.
I stopped off at the hospital
and saw Dulann. He's looking better.
Yeah, they say he should be
on his feet in a few days.
Tirk, well, he's gonna take
a little while longer...
...but he says he'll be ready
when we need him.
Whenever that is.
So how long are we grounded for
this time?
Not long.
Just until they get her up
and running again.
The Liandra?
It's the only one available.
But there's no rush this time.
They'll make sure she's in
top condition before we go.
Right. Top condition for
a cursed 20-year-old ship...
...that's been through, what,
two wars, four crews...
...some of which are still there,
in a sort of, kind of dead kind of way.
Dulann thinks since we found the traitor
and saved the ship, they'll be quiet now.
At least for a while.
As for the Liandra...
...well, the funny thing is,
I really don't mind.
Maybe it has something to do
with going through all that together...
...but as far as ships go...
...I think this one will do just fine.
So do we have a mission yet?
- I greatly appreciate the ride, captain.
- No, it's my pleasure, G'Kar.
You know, rumor has it you spent
the last few years...
...just wandering the galaxy.
- Yes, with a friend.
She's gone now. It was...
Well, there are no words, really.
There are things out there
beyond imagination...
...and I have a rather
healthy imagination.
You'll have to tell me
about it sometime.
No reason for it.
The path I took
is not the path you will take...
...and where you walk, you will see
things even more astonishing...
...and you will do so
in fine company.
Nearing Epsilon jumpgate.
Prepare to jump.
I hope the security conference
goes well.
Let us know
if you come up with anything.
- I will.
- Standing by.
Jump.
I should get my bags.
Are you coming aboard?
No. No, we have to get back.
You know, actually,
I've never seen it before.
Maybe next time,
we'll stop over for a few days.
You should. It's quite a place.
A place of good times and bad...
...of pain and growth,
but in the end...
...a place of great hope.
But if you ever do come aboard,
remember one thing:
No one there is exactly
what he seems.
But then...
...who is?
