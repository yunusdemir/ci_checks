Real figure, real nature,
sending out rays like the dawn,
making us all fall in love.
Oh, Venice !
- Oh, queen !
- Oh, queen !
Your breath is
the sirocco or bora wind
that awakens the shivers
of eternal life,
golden lady who governs us.
Oh, Venice !
Holy head, stone and diamond,
mouth that speaks,
ear that hears...
Raise that ribbon.
If you are afraid, close your eyes.
Oh, how you grow,
oh moon, with deep caves.
Oh, how you rise,
with blue and blond hair...
Rise ! Rise !
Put up the irons, put up the poles,
pour wine, bring out the jug for her.
Fill her up with only the best.
She is a drunkard, a glutton !
Who knows what she will donate
to us, after !
Miuna screwer, defecating buttocks,
subterranean old woman,
old smelly woman or big Miuna,
flirter and cheater,
who we are forced to accept as wife
mother, wicked mother-in-law,
sister and grandmother...
A tragedy ! A tragedy !
We won't see it anymore !
We won't see it anymore !
We won't see
this damned head anymore !
"A nun who has seen you for
two months at the convent Mass,
wishes to meet you.
She will be waiting for you
at San Bartolo island tonight.
Without a servant,
and carrying a candle."
My love, please. Let me take off
those clothes which are so serious.
They are ill-suited
for our love encounter.
We must wait.
What ?
I do not know if my friend
has already arrived.
Friend ?
He is here.
Who ?
- My lover De Bernis.
- The French ambassador ?
That is really something !
It will add a different flavor.
This villa is his.
He will allow us to use it,
but in exchange he wants to watch,
without our seeing him.
Where will this bizarre man stay ?
- He is over there.
- Where ?
Did you see those little fishes
on the wall ?
He is back there.
If you do your duty diligently,
he will not be bored.
Bored ?
With me ?
- He will be amazed.
- Really ?
Never has he seen
your femininity, your grace,
highlighted by such
a well-mannered lover.
Not well-mannered !
It is an offense.
When do two lovers, overtaken
by frenzy, worry about manners ?
Then... I will only be delicate.
What is it ?
Oh, what a lovely jewel !
Is it gold ?
What bird is it ?
A dove ? Or an owl ?
No, no, no.
Stop.
There.
Now you must chase me because
that is what he likes.
Alright.
Your lover deserves being a cuckold.
And we will apply ourselves to this,
all night long.
Come up.
Very good.
Turn around.
Stop, stop !
No, no, no.
Love, love.
Well done, my young man.
Very good.
I would say your performance
was excellent.
I have heard many admirable
things about you.
To be more demanding,
when you were on your back,
you could have done better.
There, you lacked a bit in...
imagination.
But on the whole,
the performance was well done.
Bravo !
Mister Ambassador, your approval...
Giacomo.
Your approval fills me
with great pride.
However, with your permission,
I want to say that my capacities
go beyond what you have
just been a spectator of.
I studied engineering, literature...
Giacomo.
and I am learned in the art
of politics and economy.
I modestly believe
that some of my discoveries
would be favorably accepted
by the King of France's government.
Besides being a dilettante
in the studies of alchemy,
which almost led me to increase
the volume of mercury,
- I am an expert in divination.
- Take this.
I invented an infallible method
to double the profits of a state,
in the brief time span of one year.
If I may dare...
Your cape.
In all humility, I would like
to ask your excellency,
for a letter of presentation.
I am ready to leave immediately
for your wonderful country
which I love and consider
my second homeland.
Good-bye.
Do you care for me ?
Giacomo Casanova !
Giacomo Casanova !
In the name
of Messer Grande,
the illumined judges
of the Inquisition court,
you are under arrest.
Why ? Why ?
"Giacomo Casanova, you are guilty
of exercising black magic,
of possessing prohibited evil books,
of being the author of heretic
writings and of criticizing religion.
I, Messer Grande, by order
of the Inquisitors of Venice,
declare you under arrest. You will be
put into the Piombi prison.
I respect the illuminated judgement
of the court, Messer Grande,
but I am obliged to repeat that
I declare myself absolutely innocent.
Come.
Listen, listen...
Open ! Open ! I cannot live
in this horrible cell !
It is an injustice ! Open !
I am not a heretic. Open !
Open !
Why ?
My life of freedom
seemed so far away.
The pleasant company,
the love encounters.
Marietta, we need a different
thread here !
He looks a like a mannequin.
- Are those things real ?
- What ?
That silk, those ornaments,
that satin he is wearing.
With a nose such as his,
I wonder what the rest is like !
Tonina, pass me the thread.
Look at what a lovely statue !
The artist should have added
more color.
That girl is a big worry for me.
She does not eat, does not sing, does
not laugh and is always at home !
Here she is !
My lady is outside waiting.
Hurry ! Hide !
Slip underneath !
She looks like a peacock !
Come out from under there ! Get
to work or it will never get done.
You know he is starting
to act like a madman again ?
Again ?
I cannot believe it.
I tell you that it is so.
Worse than before.
He is insolent and brazen.
My dear, it is a real martyrdom.
Do you not think we should do
something to repress
who is so disobedient
and rebellious ?
But what ?
What more can I do ?
I try to hide him,
to keep him away from other
people's looks, as much as I can.
But he is so brazen and reckless
and shrewd !
He shamelessly likes to show off.
Wherever he goes, he does anything
to be seen by everyone !
I live in the fear that any moment
he may even speak.
He might make fun of me
to make me look ridiculous.
Yes, he is very pompous
and self-centered.
He looks like a fanatic.
He bloats more and more
every day, right ?
That is right, and he
always causes scandal in church !
He distracts the faithful
from thinking of God.
Everyone's eyes go to him !
He is a sacrilegious instrument.
He interrupts prayer,
communication with God !
He fills everyone's eyes
with his fat, round cheeks.
There is nothing left to do.
He absolutely must be punished.
- Yes, he must be whipped.
- Uncover him !
I have waited so long
to hear him scream !
Whip me, mortify my flesh !
Do it ! Make him cry !
He is so brazen !
- Have no pity !
- No !
I cannot. I love him too much.
Have pity on him.
He is not wicked. He loves me.
Do you not love me ?
He is lovely, he is my best
friend. My sweetheart.
He is lovely ! He is lovely !
He is lovely ! He is lovely !
Sweetheart, sweetheart.
One, two, three...
No, with me, silly !
Maestro... look at me !
My respects, Sir.
Your servant, Master.
Very good.
She looks like a broom.
Turn.
- What is the matter ?
- Annamaria is sick again.
Poor girl.
Three or four times a day.
- Shall I call a doctor ?
- Run. Have him come immediately !
Thank you for your trouble.
- The doctor is coming !
- The doctor !
Bleeding.
Bleeding ?
Give it to me.
Look, Holy Mother !
I cannot look at it.
What can I do if I am in love
with you, Annamaria ?
Your spiritual beauty attracts
the artist that is inside of me.
I would like to model you
like a wax statue,
like the statue
I thought you were.
I would be your pygmalion, I would
give vital breath to my creature
and would give you my life
with my own blood.
My own fire would burn
inside of you.
What are you doing here ?
- I am breathing the sea air.
- In the dark, and all alone ?
It is the best hour. After which,
the mosquitoes begin to bite.
Do you know that you frightened me ?
You are so pale !
Do you know these verses ?
"The moon itself
was incarnated inside of her."
What is it ?
The figure-head of a ship
which sunk.
The sea dragged it here.
Think of those poor people !
Deep down there...
People of the house !
Annamaria fainted. Hurry !
The doctor, please.
Annamaria, love.
Doctor, she is here.
Why does this always happen
to the poor girl ?
- What can we do, Doctor ?
- Bleeding.
What is her disease ?
My escape from the Piombi prison
was an artwork of intelligence.
The calculation was exact,
together with intuition and courage.
These qualities were all
blessed by good fortune.
I had never seen Venice
from so far above.
I could barely recognize it.
My beloved city,
which I had to abandon forever.
In Paris, the Marquise D'Ufre's salon
was the one most sought after,
by every outstanding person
of art and culture.
I had the honor of being
invited there.
Among others,
I met Count Saint-Germain,
a magician who practiced occultism,
who I considered without scruples.
He boasted being 300 years old,
thanks to some
of his alchemy secrets.
I had a discussion with him,
in which I was victorious.
The famous Marquise D'Ufre',
an extraordinary
and fascinating woman,
adored being surrounded by magicians,
people with exceptional perception.
She, herself, was an expert
in necromancy.
I am in contact
with the Queen of Saba.
Oh, how kind !
She has returned to us.
What is the water that does not
come from the rocks,
that does not fall from the sky,
that does not come from the earth ?
Answer, the sweat of a horse.
They are the enigmas of Salomon.
That is his answer to the queen.
We received the message.
Thank you.
If you really believe
in these extra-human contacts,
why do you not move inside the soul
of the Queen of Saba ?
She has soul deficiency,
as all women do.
The Council of Trento gave judgement
on this nonsense.
Women possess only two soul
qualities. Men have three.
Women lack the noble soul,
the immortal one.
But for a real woman,
even one soul is more than enough,
as long as it blends in with that
of a man, in perfect harmony,
with the fusion of their bodies.
What do you want, Marquese ?
Oh, yes. I understand.
She want us to hear the opinion
of her young niece, Edvige,
who is very learned in theology.
What were you studying this morning,
my child ?
I was reading Saint Augustine,
which I found absurd.
I think I can disprove
some of his statements.
Which of his statements
did you disprove ?
His theory on the mother
of the Savior.
Saint Augustine sustains that Mary
conceived Jesus through her ears.
- Do you doubt it ?
- Yes, for three reasons.
First: because God, since He is not
material substance,
needs no hole through which
to enter or exit.
Second: the hearing tubes do not
communicate with maternal alveolus.
Third: if the Virgin Mary
had conceived through her ears,
she should have given birth
through her ears, right ?
But in this case... Excuse me...
In this case,
the Catholics are right
in considering the Virgin,
a virgin before she conceived.
Here is my refuge, my secret church,
my interior dwelling.
My magic laboratory.
Everything you see,
comes from an antique period.
And it arrived here... mysteriously.
Did you recognize it ?
It was from the divine Paracelsus.
This liquid has been boiling
for 15 years,
and will have to boil
for another five.
Tell the truth.
You possess the secret
of the philosopher's stone, right ?
No. No, madam.
What makes you think that ?
My dear friend
you can trust me.
I know you have the famous stone
and also the capacity to communicate
with the spirits of the 4 elements.
You could overthrow
the King of France at any time.
I would never dare.
I love France.
You over-estimate me, my friend.
Giacomo, I beg you,
help me in the great work.
The great work ?
What do you mean ?
Please, you know what it is about.
Speak.
I have to die,
and at the moment of my death
I will be transformed into a man...
A man who will live in eternity !
But this is possible
only if I am fecundated
by an initiate
of my same pyramidal sign.
At the moment of birth, my soul
will enter in the newborn's body
and I will no longer exist
as a woman,
but will go back to living
as a man.
A man who will live forever !
You, without a doubt,
are the man who was sent to me
to help me carry out
this great work.
My dear friend, why are you crying ?
It is nothing.
Nothing, really.
Show me your other treasures.
Please, Madam.
All this will be yours
when together we will have created
the great work.
Oh, no !
I did not mean material treasures,
but spiritual ones.
The treasures of your
ultra-terrestrial knowledge.
My dear Giacomo,
the divine Anael has already painted
your portrait in a dream for me.
And I knew...
Be silent.
I am in Paris !
You are in Paris !
Beautiful Paris,
the city of the Mazzarinos,
the Racines, the Voltaires !
Paris !
My young and greedy heart
sings a voluptuous hymn of glory !
The sudden overturning of
the carriage which frightened me,
was maybe a help from destiny.
In fact, he who had almost ended up
under the wheels,
was non-the-less
than my abbey brother,
who some time ago
left Venice and his priest's cassock
to lead a decadent life in Paris,
together with a young red haired
woman from Treviso,
who had incautiously given in
to his flattery.
I eliminated that dirty liar
with a few coins
and brought with me the girl, who,
besides being attractive and witty,
would have been the ideal person
in my plan for the Marquise.
I planned on talking to her
about it.
Selene.
Anubis.
Osiris.
Let us go beyond
the pleasures of the flesh.
Let us concentrate on melting
our souls together in perfect unison.
Scent of Venus !
Love is the source
and root of life.
Love generates both good and bad
impulses and passions.
Love generates the eternal flame,
both divine as well as human.
Love generates gods and demons.
Take her in your arms.
Come, madam.
Come closer.
Scent of Venus.
Giacomo, the hour of Venus has come.
I am yours.
May the great work be accomplished.
Wait.
I must first complete
my calculations.
I think we are still
in the hour of Mars.
Marcolina.
Come here.
Turn around. I cannot do it.
Bend over.
Never does a man fall
into the deep abyss
and then with equal violence
is thrown up
towards he who is perfection,
like that diaphanous instant
in which the essence of his virility
reaches and touches
the root of the opposite sex.
There, there !
Now silence.
Silence.
- Love.
- Yes.
Marcolina.
Move.
Closer. Come !
Uncover it.
I can do it. I can do it !
I will pierce you !
I will open you up !
I can do it !
Good boy !
Sirs ! Sirs !
Two years later, in Forli',
I was to meet the greatest
love of my life.
Requested by some policemen,
I had gotten myself
into a furious brawl
which started in an inn.
The man in the adjacent room
had been accused by the Pope's guards
of having let a woman in,
dressed as a man.
Put down that sword
or I will be forced to fire !
The host declares that last night
he asked for a lodging
with a young officer who this
morning he discovered was a woman.
He has been screaming like a madman
and slaps that document in our face.
Do you understand
what is written in it ?
This gentleman is Hungarian.
He is a Hungarian officer,
so you are committing a violation.
We were called by the host !
Yes. I don't want to go to jail. You
cannot joke with the Holy Father !
Enough !
- Bring the coffee !
- It is a scandal !
I am French.
My name is Henriette.
What language do you speak
with your lover ?
We do not speak.
It has no use in what we do.
Whoever takes a journey to Parma
must be prepared to know at least
three divinities:
salami, ham
and the famous third one...
Parmesan cheese.
I asked myself who
this young lady was.
What is her relationship
with this Hungarian
who could be her father ?
Does she have a husband in Parma ?
Or in her libertine frenzy, does she
look for other lovers and pleasures ?
The captain seemed to have read
my thoughts.
In his bad grammar Latin,
he told me
that even he knew nothing about
this lovely and mysterious lady.
She had turned to him,
asking for protection
as if she feared something
or someone.
But now he had to leave her,
having to go up north.
I could have taken care of her.
Why do you look at me like that ?
You do not recognize me anymore ?
I feel unimportant next to you.
I cannot call you by your first name.
You are no longer the brave
and bizarre officer I knew.
I will always remain the same girl.
She who had three moments of madness
in her life.
And the last, wonderful madness
was knowing you.
We were invited to a concert
at the hunchback Du Bois' home.
He was an eccentric gentleman
with uncertain amorous boundaries,
just as uncertain were
the boundaries of the Parma dukedom,
divided between the Spanish
and the French.
That evening, two civilizations,
two opposite conceptions of life,
faced each other.
An antique proverb says,
"What is lighter than a feather ?
Ashes.
And what is lighter than ashes ?
The wind.
And lighter than the wind ?
Woman.
And lighter than woman ?
Nothing."
We exercise much power over women,
much tyranny,
and we made them accept it
only because
they are kinder,
more reasonable,
more generous than man.
Such qualities which should have made
them superior to us,
instead, put them at our mercy,
because men, in fact, are a hundred
times more unreasonable,
more cruel, violent.
They are more inclined
by nature, to oppress.
Women's kisses are like a glass
of wine.
You drink and drink,
and drink... and then succumb.
He who never speaks badly of women,
does not love them.
Because to understand them and love
them, you must suffer for them.
So then, and only then,
can you find happiness
on the lips of your beloved.
A kiss is just the desire
of devouring what you kiss.
I really think that Du Bois
has that sort of appetite !
What is a kiss ?
Simply the desire to get lost
in the soul of the woman you love.
We are beginning !
Silence. You will see
a lovely performance.
He himself embroidered
his costume.
It is all metaphoric.
The boy is good too !
- He is very handsome !
- Bravo !
He was extraordinary. Do you not
agree ? You loved him, right ?
The music made me cry,
but I did not understand the story.
I do not deserve so much applause.
I wrote this work
for Giambruno.
Thank you, Giambruno.
- Bravo.
- Thank you.
My sincere compliments
for the virtuoso singer
and the mime instructor.
Amazing.
But after the topics discussed
at the table,
you will not be surprised
of my absolute disapproval
of the idea behind
your captivating ballet.
Who is this Enrichetta ?
Who is this priceless treasure
of which I have become owner ?
Is it really possible ?
Oh, stars ! You tell me !
Cry it out from the depth
of your sky,
that the happy mortal
to which this creature belongs to,
is Giacomo Casanova. Only him !
Mister Casanova,
what is the matter ?
My friend, I am afraid.
I am afraid of my happiness.
- Yes ?
- Enrichetta...
She is an extraordinary woman,
with an extraordinary destiny.
- However, I am tempted...
- Forgive me, gentlemen.
Mister D'Antoine.
- Wonderful !
- A real concert player !
- Where did you learn so well ?
- In the convent.
But if it was not for a precise
order from the bishop,
the abbess would never have given
me permission to play.
That pious wife of Christ, said that
when I played the violoncello
I always had an indecent pose.
Mademoiselle, I apologize
for being so late.
The trip is long.
Always, always with you,
my sweet Enrichetta.
Cruel Enrichetta,
how many things you hide from me.
Your past, your virtues,
your talents.
When I heard you play
the violoncello,
you almost made me die.
Enrichetta.
Love.
Love.
Forever.
- Mister Du Bois.
- Good morning.
I am sorry to have intruded
into your apartment,
but the servants let me in
without announcing me.
I accept your apologies, but what do
I owe the honor of this visit to ?
As you noticed, Miss Enrichetta
is no longer here.
Where did she go ?
What happened to her ?
Nothing. My dear friend,
she is better off than you or me.
But sudden important obligations
forced her
to leave before dawn.
I only caught a glimpse of her
while she was climbing
into Mister D'Antoine's carriage.
In this circumstance,
she begged me to come advise you.
Or better yet, advise you not to do
anything to find her.
Why did she have to leave ?
Who is D'Antoine ?
Do not be agitated.
I cannot tell you anything else,
except that the mysterious Enrichetta
is no longer available.
An important person,
from a European court,
has full power over her.
D'Antoine is the emissary who came
to take her to her right place.
Her place is with me.
I will find her.
I will not lose her, if I have
to face the armies of all of Europe.
Where did she go ?
- Where is she headed ?
- Towards the Alps, naturally.
I will leave immediately.
I must find her at all costs.
She is my sole, only love.
Mister Casanova !
I beg you !
In my super-human pain
I was anxious to kill myself.
Or bury myself in a cloister.
A monk forever.
I did not choose death,
nor to become a monk.
Death, the great friend of generous
and unfortunate spirits.
Many years later, in London,
I tried the extreme step.
Guilty of such unhealthy temptation,
was the infamous Charpillon,
and her daughter.
Thief ! There were 200 sequins,
the corsets and the silver mirror !
I will not tolerate this insinuation.
Take your hands off of me,
you whore !
Me, whore ? I did not have the chance
of being one with you, impotent !
Exploiter ! Damned the day
I accepted you in my home !
You and your lies on the stars,
on horoscopes !
You and your daughter
are truly damned.
You contaminated what was most dear
to me... My health !
Filthy syphilis carriers,
thieves, leaches !
Because of you, I am ruined.
All of London laughs behind my back.
You, with that rotten worm between
your legs, infected me !
- Enough ! Coachman, stop !
- Coachman !
Let me off, or I'll stab you
with my sword, witches !
We are going to the police station !
You will repeat your accusations
to them !
Go to hell, you and
your miserable daughter !
Do not touch those bags !
Coachman, leave immediately !
Whip those horses if you do not want
Lord Winston to whip you !
Whore !
- Thief !
- Leave me alone !
My bag !
Mother, I have it !
Mother, do something !
Mother !
Cowardly bastard.
If you take one step,
I will kill you.
- Damned witches.
- Quick, open !
May you end your days
in the filthiest brothels
of Turkey.
May you be locked up
in the most miserable prisons.
Leave !
Disgusting bitches !
Damned whores !
You dishonor the name of all women !
Away !
Why ?
You two witches mortified me,
robbed me,
destroyed me... Why ?
Giacomo,
is it possible that your star
has reached the hour of dawn ?
You put up with vile insults,
you underwent the worst
humiliation of your life.
For the first time,
your senses did not correspond
to your desire.
Eros has abandoned you.
And dark death arises
in front of you.
So, if destiny decides,
that I
am to face the moment of death,
I shall do so as best suits me.
I will go dressed
with my best attire,
the one I wear for festivities.
Soon I shall be ready
to enter into the antique courts
of antique men.
In the peace of Limbo,
they will welcome me.
I will meet Horace, Dante,
I will converse with Petrarch,
with Ariosto,
and with you, Torquato Tasso.
My tender friend whose verses
come to my mind
in this supreme moment.
Where are you ?
Where are you ?
The great Mouna !
The queen of whales !
Everyone can enter.
The stomach is still warm.
A female whale. Look at its
mouth, inviting you to go inside.
Are you afraid ?
He who does not enter into its
stomach will not find the treasure.
So says the antique book of wisdom.
Come and you will see inside
its throat and farther down,
in the stomach
of the great Mouna...
The Mouna is a door
that leads who knows where,
a wall that must be knocked down.
The Mouna is a spider-web,
a silk funnel.
The heart of all flowers.
The Mouna is a white mountain
of sugar,
a forest where wolves pass by.
It is the carriage
that pulls horses.
The Mouna is an empty whale,
full of air and black with fireflies,
an oven that burns everything.
When the time comes, the Mouna
is the face of the Lord, His mouth.
The world with its trees came out
of the Mouna.
Clouds, men...
One at a time, all races.
Even woman came out of the Mouna.
Hurrah for the Mouna,
the Mouna, the Mouna !
Giacomo ?
Giacomo.
What are you doing here ?
Egard ! How strange to meet you.
Maybe you can help me. Listen.
"When I am drunk, I know neither
the sky nor the earth.
I lie alone,
immobile in my bed.
Until, in the end,
I forget that I exist.
And at that moment
my happiness has no limits."
Lung-ho-Tse: a Chinese poet
of the Eighth Century.
You travel in lands
that do not exist, Egard.
Oh, Giacomo !
I travel much too,
but in the real world.
But where do your travels,
in the bodies of women, take you ?
No place.
Something strange happened to me.
Life, having nauseated me,
I wanted to kill myself.
I was already inside
the waters of the river,
reciting one of Tasso's sonnets,
when I saw an extraordinary woman
pass by. She was over 7 feet tall.
She aroused my curiosity. I tried
to follow her, but she disappeared.
And I have lost hope of finding her.
You have found her, Giacomo.
She is here.
Princess Hathajaha !
The tallest and strongest woman
in the world !
A jug of beer
to who can defeat her !
- Big John ! That is who is needed.
- He will defeat her.
- He will break her in two.
- Big John, come. They want you.
Big John ! Call the apothecaries !
Call the surgeon
for your giant woman !
Come on. She is not a cannibal !
Who else ? Who else ?
Whoever is brave,
will fight with the strong woman.
Whoever is a coward, will run away !
- What do you mean ?
- Nothing, my lord.
Do not think I said "coward"
to a gentlemen like you,
certainly continental ! It is not
possible that you have no honor.
I am the sole custodian of my honor,
and I consider any reference to it,
a violation.
Do you accept fighting
for a jug of beer ?
Keep your beer.
Of course I will fight !
I am a Venetian gentlemen.
I fought against the Turks.
It is my turn, madam.
He will not even get to five !
Let me win. Do not make me give
a bad impression.
Please.
What do you think you are doing ?
- Are you Venetian ?
- From the mountains.
Who are you, mythological creature ?
How did you end up in London ?
I had a bad marriage.
My husband sold me like an animal.
I was weak
and could not defend myself.
I like it here,
and enjoy the work.
I like the people, good people.
Come with me.
This is the fighting tent. See ?
Tonight she was an earthquake.
She knocked down eight men
that were bigger than you.
The strongest woman in the world
in one minute will become a fury !
Go, Angelina !
One !
Two !
Three !
Four !
Angelina, do not eat them !
She is the strongest female in
the world ! The queen of the forest.
She won !
She threw eight men on the ground !
Hurrah for the queen !
Hurrah for the queen !
I absolutely must see her.
It is forbidden.
Follow me.
The opening ! Slowly !
You know you should not stop
with people you do not know.
You know nothing about
the evils of the world.
Behind the face of a flower,
you can find a black heart.
Remember how we ran that winter
in Hungary ?
You have long legs and with only
one step, you go where you want,
but Ali' and I have short legs...
Luckily, the elephant made
her die of fright !
Good. You put all the dolls
to sleep !
Take off your clothes, Angelina.
The bath is ready.
My cape fell !
Good !
Another blow like that and
Totonno will become a midget !
The tub is full !
- Come, Angelina.
- Is it hot ?
The other evening you made me sneeze
all night !
Slowly. You will make
the water overflow !
- Hold still !
- Stop, Angelina.
- I put my foot in your hair.
- Yes, and in my balls !
Angelina, sing that song
from your country
which makes me nostalgic
about my country.
The horses are ready, Sir.
Everyone has left.
What an unforgettable day !
How exciting that day in Rome
when the Holy Father
let me kiss his loving hand
so many times.
On that same evening I was invited
to Lord Talou's patrician building.
He was the English ambassador
to the holy city of Rome.
It is him ! My handsome Carluccio !
Come on, Carluccio !
Come on, run !
Come on, handsome !
You can make it !
Carluccio, run as you do
when you run away from the police !
Run, Carluccio !
Run as if I were riding you !
My dear Giacomo,
welcome to Rome.
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.
This evening we will not play,
at least not with cards !
It does not matter, my lord.
Your company pleases me, anyway.
Is this magnificent building yours ?
No. I rented it from the Prince
Del Brando for 100 guineas,
including his hams.
Lord Talou, try to stop them !
I know them. When they drink,
they make you go mad !
Lord Talou, he will break his head !
Stop, Rolando !
Take him below and send him away.
That stupid idiot has no balls !
- I won !
- The competition is over. Carlo won.
Natale, check if the basin
is empty !
The competition is over.
The basin is empty. Carlo won !
You are not giving me a little kiss ?
It is embarrassing to admit that
the city where the Holy Father lives
is still like the days
of Trimalcione.
In the Piombi prison,
one could not play certain games,
especially for lack of space.
If I know who
I have the honor of...
I am the Prince Del Brando.
Excellency, everyone knows I was
thrown into that miserable prison
for noble political causes.
I will not even allow a prince
to make certain insinuations
on the injustice I underwent there.
Do not take my joke so seriously !
Wine !
I have heard of you, Mister Casanova.
I am your great admirer.
If I were a woman, I would not have
hesitated to come to bed with you.
I heard many great things
about you !
I thank you. The admiration
of such a gentleman like you
makes me undoubtedly proud.
Your merits were compared
to those of a stallion,
and sometimes to those
of a less noble animal.
What do you mean ?
From this point of view, I mean !
Your jokes should be taken seriously,
because they are not humorous.
I will smash this lying pig !
This gentleman from Venice is a poet,
a philosopher, a mathematician,
and is learned in who knows
how many other things.
I know someone who can do better
than you in a certain field.
- Who ?
- Righetto.
Where is Righetto ?
Find Righetto, my coachman.
Tell him to come here !
He is outside, Excellency !
Righetto, come here. They want you.
At your command, Prince.
Righetto, how many times did you
make love last night with Ubaldina ?
Come on, answer !
With everyone's respect, 7 times.
He is lying.
Brutal force alone is not capable
of such amorous feats.
Only a body supported by cleverness,
intelligence,
and culture can reach such peaks.
I know what I am talking about.
A moral maturity is required,
and especially knowledge
of movement of fluids,
of star and planet influences.
Excellent, Giacomo. Excellent.
You convinced everyone
with your eloquence.
Why not accept a challenge ?
Brutal force against intelligence.
The good savage exalted
by that boring Rousseau,
against the gentleman
with style and culture.
- What does it mean ?
- I shall explain.
Righetto and Casanova are invited
to participate in a competition.
Who can do it more times
in an hour, right ?
Right !
I am very disappointed that you,
such a good host,
should risk the honor
of your guest,
by obliging him in a competition
with a coachman !
Mister Giacomo, do not take Lord
Talou's proposal the wrong way.
On the contrary, it honors you.
Why not consider it a competition
between vulgarity and poetry ?
I, to begin with,
am convinced that you will win.
Once again, homo sapiens
will defeat primitive man.
Madam, your way of...
speaking, of exposing...
However, I am certain
that the victory will be mine.
In any case, it is clear
that I must choose my companion
in this competition.
- He is right. He should choose her.
- It is his right !
My choice goes to...
Romana.
Romana, the most beautiful
model in Rome.
Her generous forms have often
been immortalized on canvas, marble.
Romana, the Venus
of the countryside !
Now bring me a basket of eggs,
a bottle of wine from Spain,
ginger, cinnamon, and clover.
My necklace on Casanova !
My robust Righetto, will you accept
me as the woman, who, for one hour,
will receive the impulses
of your rustic loins ?
May the good Lord
make me worthy, Princess.
Challengers, go to your places,
and begin their pleasant,
I hope, trial.
He put eighteen eggs inside !
God protect you and give you health !
Oh ! Nineteen !
He is drinking all of them !
What do you have inside there ?
Where will all those eggs
come out from ?
How do you feel ?
Flabby, flabby, huh ?
What does he want now ?
With such an omelet in his stomach !
I bet on you, and I want to win !
Make sure that I win.
If I bet on you,
will you make me win ?
I will do everything
to make you win.
The challenge entailing
four testicles is about to begin !
A great poet
against a dirty primitive !
Move from there.
It is not something for children.
- Is it shaped the way the say ?
- Go away !
I bet both my horses on Casanova.
Righetto, help me.
This for the back
and this for the head.
- Righetto, take my shoes off.
- Your servant, Princess.
Be silent !
Thirty seconds left !
- Shall I get undressed too ?
- Of course.
Silence, please ! The competition
will begin in 20 seconds !
Fifteen seconds left !
Ten seconds !
Nine seconds !
Eight seconds !
Seven !
Six seconds !
Five !
Four seconds !
Three !
Two seconds !
One second !
Go !
Three ! He already did three !
How do you feel down there ?
Want me to substitute you ?
Righetto is very nervous,
but he is calming down now.
He did two !
Three ! Righetto, three !
Hurrah for the performance
of the trial !
If you had not won,
I would have mounted you !
Let us bring him in triumph !
Bravo !
Who will let you leave now ?
Rome is yours !
I would like to tell you
about a marvelous creature
who my restless spirit
looked for all my life.
I was in Switzerland,
in the antique town of Bern,
a guest of Doctor Moebius,
a famous entomologist.
I was looking at his daughters
at work, scientists and seers,
when suddenly a silence
isolated me from everything,
and I was overtaken
by a strange ill feeling.
The miracle took place.
Not only am I cured, but I feel much
better and stronger than before.
It is thanks to you,
my adorable scientists.
You made me become ill and
you gave me back the joy of health.
Why do you say we made you ill ?
Did I say that ?
Strange.
I do not know.
Oh, yes. I remember.
Those horrible insects
with those monstrous demon forms
that move about without a reason.
Evil !
Evil in its living state.
And you there,
with your big pins...
Seeing both of you piercing
them, one by one... horrible !
Was it as if you were pierced
a thousand times ?
Yes. The pain I imagined
was so real on me,
that it overwhelmed me.
I am very sensitive, without a doubt.
I am a creature of elements,
air, water...
And fire, too.
That is what I heard about you.
My God, how beautiful you are.
Your gracious smile
is so descreet.
It is like those figures
on Etruscan tombs.
A merry and deathly smile.
Deathly ? Is that how you speak
to who saved you from death ?
Only to deliver me to another
sweet death, that of love.
I feel that I want to be annulled
inside of you, my wise Minerva.
What a strange man you are,
Giacomo.
You cannot talk about love
without using deathly figures ?
The sweetest of deaths. You want
to annul yourself in love...
Maybe there is more to love.
You wish to die ?
As late as possible,
enchanting Isabella.
When that moment comes, I want
to be able to squeeze your hand.
Would you like to eat ?
Yes ?
Isabella, I finally understand
the mysterious evil
that struck me in this house,
that brought a light inside of me.
I want a different life,
one in the quiet of my study.
I want to give up
my useless, boring freedom
and always be lovingly guided
by you.
Say yes, Isabella.
I beg you, my illuminated savior.
You are mad, Giacomo.
Maybe you speak like this because
you are still weak from your illness.
Listen to me, Isabella. You cannot
refuse me, or I will be ill again,
and this time, forever.
I was right in saying
that you are made of fire.
Tomorrow I am leaving.
Please, Isabella, come with me.
No, it cannot be.
- Join me in Dresda.
- Dresda ? How is that possible ?
I...
Oh, Giacomo !
Yes, alright.
At the Moors' inn in Dresda.
My life !
A lady is expecting me.
Have you been informed ?
It is not necessary.
Answer my question.
Is there someone among you
expecting this gentleman ?
Isabella, you cannot
have betrayed me.
I know you will come.
I shall wait here
all my life, if need be.
It is not possible !
Look who is here ! Giacomo !
You are here, handsome !
There is nothing to laugh about !
Hello, old friend !
He is better than four stallions !
Madam, excuse me. I believe I do not
have the honor of knowing you.
Are you playing precious with me ?
With Astrodi, the singer,
who once you graciously
- gave her your attention.
- Madam, please...
Remember in Venice in the home
of the woman with the fat buttocks ?
I am doing a theater performance
where the grand duke will attend.
I have an appointment now.
There is a naughty German girl
in the group who will do anything.
There she is ! Hey, you !
German girl,
come out from under there !
There is a real gentleman
who wants to meet you.
She is hunchback like the devil.
Wait, look.
Pull out your tongue.
Stupid, pull it out !
She is greedy, a "handle eater" !
Inn keeper ! The best room.
I will spend the night here.
She is an earthquake !
Come see !
Glutton !
Wait ! Wait ! I shall sit here
so I can see better !
Come out.
You must see everything !
I am falling !
Gisella, give me a hand !
Giacomo.
Do you not recognize me ?
I did so immediately, "cabalon" !
Mother ! It is really you !
Did you forget that your mother
lives in Dresda ?
I have 400 thalers retirement money,
thanks to the prince's generosity.
My God protect him !
- I knew you were in Saxony...
- What are you doing here ?
I am here on business.
For a project that the minister
is interested in.
An excellent project, I must say.
An excellent occasion.
I see, the usual fables,
the usual nonsense.
You never send a cent
to your poor, old mother !
I did not know your address,
Mother !
- You never know anything !
- It is true !
I wanted to write to you,
visit you sometimes, but...
- And your second husband ?
- He is dead.
- Do you live here in Dresda ?
- No, I live in the country.
I could come to your house
for a few days.
As long as my business
allows me, but I hope so.
- In my house, with me ?
- Yes.
Are you expecting someone,
Mother ?
I am waiting to be taken
to the carriage.
My poor legs do not stand up
anymore !
I shall come to get you.
I shall take you.
I am coming up.
Mother.
How long it has been !
How are you ?
Slowly !
- Turn around now.
- On the shoulders.
Get lower ! Get lower !
You are wrong, Mother
in saying I am just a "cabalon".
My name is known in all of Europe.
I am considered a literary person.
A brilliant business man.
I do not understand German well,
Mother. What are you saying ?
You do not understand
or do not want to ?
I could find a house in the country,
maybe next to yours.
I have 400 sequins.
I can give you half if you want.
I intend to stop running around
the world. I am no longer young.
Do you have news of our relatives ?
I also hope to return to Venice,
as soon as...
I did not even ask for her address !
I went to Holland, to Belgium,
to Spain.
In Oslo, I became seriously ill.
Finally I reached Wurtemberg,
which, at the time, was the most
brilliant court of Europe.
I would like to ask you, madam,
since you wisely influence the duke,
could you not suggest to him to
offer me the position of ambassador
to the court of Saxony ?
The prince highly respects me.
I have a letter from his excellency
Cardinal Lowrier.
He kindly accepted
to recommend me to you.
I would like to submit
to the attention of your...
In my country, turtles are a sign
of good luck, Highness.
Here are the designs
for a new type of fortress
based on three principles
of Democritus and Leucippus.
I know that your war
at the borders...
Observe these seeds, Highness.
They produce a repulsive
red efflurescence,
but it has miraculous virtues.
It was discovered by a Spanish monk
who experimented it many times
on himself.
Nobody in the world could say
that man is over 40,
but he actually is over one hundred.
Princess,
I am desperate in my love for you
but your heart is of iron !
And your buttocks is of wood !
Never in my life
have I been so insulted !
I will no longer permit
that he come before my eyes,
even if I am in this palace,
and my duty as a guest
does not allow me to take up
my sword !
Go away, scoundrels,
back to your sewers !
My brother, the Duke, says you
frightened Rosalba with your sword.
That is not good for a Latin
lover of beautiful women as you are.
Enchanting !
I heard that in Nuremberg
a general had built
a mechanical chess player,
but this goes beyond any imagination.
Look ! It is perfect !
One could swear it is real flesh.
The right color.
It would fool anyone.
It is very late.
Are you still up ?
I hope you will excuse me,
Madam, for the liberty I took.
But I so much wish
to see what you are, naturally.
You do not protest ?
What sort of mad inventor
was your father ?
Certainly mad, but a poet,
if he made you so beautiful.
Did he incestuously possess you ?
You excite me
with your secret silence.
Will you lie down with me ?
Will you give your delicate
mechanism to my eagerness ?
Yes ? Oh, yes !
You are beautiful, you know ?
Do not refuse.
What is your name ?
Oh, Rosalba !
No, Rosalba. You are called love !
Love !
That is your name !
Do you know that ?
I have been looking for you forever.
Beautiful ! Child !
My beautiful devil !
Love. Give it to me !
The winter is very long in Bohemia.
For many years I have been living
in Dux, in the Waldenstein castle.
I am a librarian for the count.
An important assignment that
is fit for my studious character,
for a man of literature.
Do you feel better this evening ?
It is very warm.
My macaroni !
I want my macaroni !
I did not prepare macaroni
this evening. No macaroni !
If you want,
there is goat fried brain.
I clearly said I want macaroni
on my plate every evening !
If that is not possible,
the count will be informed.
There is polenta,
which is almost ready.
I do not want polenta !
I cannot stand that my dinner
be disturbed by such people !
Mister Casanova,
your agreement with the count
dispenses you from eating
with the servants and the troops.
Then why do you give us
this honor ?
Listen, Faulkircher.
Only because of one
of life's cruel turn of events,
that the two of us met.
You, a butler,
and I a librarian.
Respect my solitude and keep away
from me !
You are a cheating scoundrel !
You take advantage of the count's
absence, but he will find out !
Also that you practice
anti-physical attractions
with your Viderol. You disgust me !
Go ahead and speak
in your vulgar German !
Who understands you ?
I am an artist, a writer.
I do not mingle with certain people.
He is an artist too,
a very talented actor.
It disgusts me to talk to you.
Do not be so arrogant, Casanova.
You are a servant of the count
of Waldenstein, like us. A servant !
Disgusting ! You are disgusting !
I received the greatest insult ever,
in this place.
That portrait has been hung up
with a disgusting substance.
The person responsible is Faulkircher
or his deprived lover Viderol.
Which of the two furnished
the fecal material, I do not know,
considering their terrible
relationship
which easily enables
mixture of that substance.
Observe.
It is a very similar portrait.
It was printed as an illustration
in my famous novel "Icosameron".
Did you read it by chance ?
I will offer you a copy, if I may.
I think that after my death there
will be talk of me for some time,
as author of that work.
I am a famous Italian writer.
You surely know my name.
Giacomo Casanova from Venice.
A literary man,
a philosopher...
It is not for a whim
that I come to you, Countess,
but to implore justice
for a poor old man.
That shady individual, Faulkircher,
and that Viderol
find many pretexts to torment me.
They broke the door of the library,
and took away books.
And they blame me
for their disappearance !
And I have not eaten macaroni
since Wednesday !
These unpleasant happenings
disturb my activity as writer.
What should I do, Countess ?
When my son returns,
he will take care of everything.
There is a crane
above the wood-shack roof.
I want you to meet Giacomo Casanova,
an Italian adventurer
who there has been much talk about.
Giacomo !
Come. We are waiting for you.
My friends want to hear you.
Recite something.
Venice !
Will I ever return to Venice ?
The other night...
I had a dream...
Isabella.
