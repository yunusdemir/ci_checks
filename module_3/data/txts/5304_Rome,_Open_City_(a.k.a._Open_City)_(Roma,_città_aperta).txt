"The Voice of London."
Jesus.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
- The engineer, Giorgio Manfredi?
- He's not here.
- Where is he?
- We don't know...
- he doesn't always sleep at home.
- Where does he go?
I don't know. One can imagine,
a young single man...
- Right. Which is his room?
- Over there.
Search the house.
Many people visit him?
Nobody's come around
for some time.
Of course.
- How many more guests do you have?
- Two.
- Where is the telephone?
- End of the hall.
Stop, I'll answer it.
Yes, hello?
Is Giorgio there?
Yes, Manfredi.
Who am I talking to?
I'm a friend of the engineer.
- What friend?
- Who am I talking to?
- It was a woman. Who was she?
- How do I know? Could I see her?
- Have you found anything?
- No, nothing.
- What about this door?
- It leads to the terrace.
Ah, the terrace.
Calm down, would you?
- Who lives there?
- It's the Spanish Embassy.
The city will be divided
into 14 zones,
the Schrueder Plan
that we have already applied
in various European cities
allows for scientific regrouping
of large masses of men,
using the same forces.
Come in.
N.C.O. Babber has communicated
that they haven't found
the person they were looking for.
Doesn't surprise me.
If you say, I'll tell them
to bring in the girl and landlady.
No, it's not necessary, thank you.
Bad news?
Someone didn't turn up
for an appointment.
Anyone important?
I hope so.
Do you know them?
No. Who are they?
He says his name's Manfredi,
an engineer.
Manfredi?
This man's already on file.
Seems he's one of the heads
of the military command
of the National
Liberation Committee.
I've got reason to believe
beyond a doubt it's him.
But how did you catch him?
I found him here,
on this table.
Every night I take
a very long walk
through the streets of Rome,
without leaving my office.
I love this photographic genre
that catches people
almost by surprise.
You find some
very interesting people.
Not long ago, case in point,
I remember they came to
my knowledge Mr. Manfredi
and his little friend;
I said to myself:
I've seen this man
somewhere before.
Take a good look
at this group.
Second on the right.
They sent me these photos
from Berlin,
and I don't think
I'm mistaken, am I?
You're right. It's him.
It's the same person.
What a nuisance.
Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
What's all that racket?
Excuse me, Major. We've started
to interrogate the professor.
Good, but get them to shut up.
- How these Italians scream.
- Right.
Who is the girl?
Marina, an chorus girl.
Yes, I know her.
I've seen her. Charming.
Very charming.
Slow down. Take it easy.
But, what's happening?
Can't you see?
They're looting the bakery.
- What's your business in this?
- Unfortunately, I'm on duty.
- I feel helpless.
- I know, when refugees arrive.
He's got no shame.
He even had little cakes.
- That's a good one.
- Even dared to say he had no flour.
Why don't you join us?
I'm the sexton.
If I do, I'll go to hell.
Give me that.
You can eat it in heaven.
Hands off!
This is an offense.
What do I do, die of hunger?
Officer! Help!
Go to hell, you creep.
I'll go with you.
- We're here.
- Thanks.
Your welcome.
Want me to take you up?
Here, it's lighter this way.
I really shouldn't, but I've
been hungry so long.
Mrs. Pina, what do you think,
do you think those Americans
will get here after all?
Looks like it.
- Mrs. Pina. Got anything?
- Come on, leave me alone.
How dare you,
in my presence?
You've got no manners.
It's better not to take any notice.
See you later.
Goodbye.
Who are you looking for?
Does Francesco the printer
live here?
- Yes, but he's not in.
- Do you know where he's gone?
How do I know?
Off on some job.
- Excuse me, who are you?
- You're excused. What's it to you?
I understand you are Mrs. Pina.
How do you know?
Francesco always talked about you.
- But you are...
- A friend.
How stupid, I took you
for a cop.
Tell me. What do you want?
- I should go into Francesco's.
- I'll get the key and open up.
Sorry, I had trouble finding it.
Come in.
- Please.
- Thanks.
The place is dirty
and a mess.
I understand.
Do you know Don Pietro?
Parish priest of San Clemente.
I want to talk to him.
- I'll get him if you want.
- No, not you.
- Then I'll send my boy.
- Yes, that'll be better.
- Wait here for me.
- Thanks.
Marcello! Marcello!
Marcello!
- What do you want?
- Come down a moment.
I can't.
You've got to get Don Pietro.
Look lively.
- I got a lot of things to do.
- I'm telling you, come down now.
I told you many times, don't play
with Remoleto. He's trouble.
- Go and get Don Pietro.
- And what do I say?
Tell him to come right away.
And don't get lost on the way.
He's gone.
Don Pietro won't be long.
Thank you.
We looted the bakery this morning.
Oh, yeah?
- Second one this week.
- Why did the women go?
Some know why they do it,
but most get
more punches than rolls.
This morning one of them got
a pair of shoes and some scales.
I'd like to know who
stole my stockings.
Excuse me.
I'm sure...
Hey, engineer!
- Good morning, Laura.
- Good morning, why are you here?
- Have you come to see me?
- Yes, that's it.
I met this man on the stairs
and let him in. I thought...
- You could've told me.
- Well, no big deal.
It doesn't matter.
I only wanted to ask a favor.
I'll get changed.
You're okay as you are.
You see Marina, don't you?
Yes, after lunch, in the theater.
Please tell her I wont be able
to see her the next few days.
- If I can, I'll phone her.
- Very well. At the theater?
Not at the theater, no.
Bye, nice to meet you.
- Does she live with you?
- She's my sister.
- Oh, your sister.
- You're shocked, huh?
Who knows how many lies
she's told you?
Who knows where she said she lives?
She's ashamed of us because
she says she's an artist
and we're just plain workers
but I wouldn't change for her.
I understand.
Not that she's bad, just stupid.
But what do you know
about Laureta?
Sorry, I'm prying.
No, Laureta is a good friend
of a girl I know.
- Who, Marina?
- Do you know her?
Since she was born.
Her mother was the caretaker
at Tiburtina Street,
where my dad had
a scrap metal business.
You could say she and Laureta
grew up together.
But, please don't say
anything to Marina
about what I told you,
I beg you.
No, don't fret,
I won't be seeing her again.
- Why not?
- I don't know why,
but I've got a feeling
it's got to end.
- Have you known her long?
- Yeah, about four months.
I'd just come to Rome
and she usually had lunch
in a little trattoria
near the Spanish Steps.
One day a siren went off,
every body ran for it,
and we were left alone.
She laughed, wasn't afraid at all.
- And you fell in love.
- Yeah, it happens.
Yeah, it happens.
But she's not the woman for me.
Maybe if I'd met her
before I lived on Tiburtina.
What's that got to do with it?
A woman can change,
especially if she's in love.
Who says she's in love?
Why wouldn't she be?
God, I haven't even asked if
you want a coffee. Want one?
- Don't bother.
- Please.
It'll only take a moment.
I'll do it right now.
I call it coffee just to
call it something.
Careful, Don Pietro.
It's you. What a miracle
seeing you in church.
I've come because
my mother sent me.
She's done well.
It won't do you any harm.
Don. Pietro, let me finish.
You've got come to our house now.
- It's important.
- What is it?
I don't know,
it's a mystery to me
but I think there's someone
in Francesco's place.
Very well, let's go.
Gilberto!
Listen. Agostino's coming now.
Meanwhile, you're referee.
And above all,
behave yourselves, alright?
Come here.
Why not come to church more often?
How can one waste time in church
at a time like this?
But, what are you saying?
Maybe you don't understand,
but we've got to close ranks
against the common enemy.
Tell me who told you
these things.
- Remoleto.
- Remoleto told you.
Don Pietro, please don't
tell anyone.
Here comes 'Purgatory'.
Don Pietro.
- What have you brought.
- I've been shopping.
Have you spent all the coupons?
Not a one.
Why so much bread?
I don't know.
There was some party...
I don't know what party.
Neither did the baker.
Well, I've got to go now.
- What party was that?
- I don't get it.
Let's hope my mother
has found out.
That's it.
It didn't turn out well,
but at least it's hot.
- Drink it quick.
- Thank you.
Francesco tells me
you're getting married.
A belated marriage, you understand,
me in this condition.
We'd set the date ages ago,
but then, for one reason
or another it got delayed.
But this time it's for sure.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
Then I must give you a gift.
For God's sake, ours is
a wartime marriage.
We'll go to Don. Pietro
and that's that.
You're having a church wedding?
Yes. Francesco didn't want to,
but I said:
better if Don Pietro marries us,
who's at least one of us,
instead of a fascist collaborator
in the court, don't you think?
If you put it that way, yes.
Truth is, I believe in God.
Tell me, what are you
doing now, working?
I was working in the Breda factory,
but they fired us.
The Germans are taking everything.
That'll be Don Pietro. I'll open up.
- Good morning, Don Pietro.
- Good morning.
Well, excuse me. I'm off.
- Thanks for coming.
- Don't mention it.
- Well, what are you doing?
- Who's there?
Who's there? What do you care?
Go get some water. Move it!
- I've got to talk to you.
- Come in.
There's more than 500
in the mountains at Taglio Cotto.
The group's ready and waiting.
You can't abandon them.
The time's set for 6 this
afternoon on Burgino Bridge.
One of them is coming.
It's better I don't go because
I'm on file and
now the curfew
starts at 5.
- Right. I'll go.
- I knew you would.
- What's the message.
- It's not a message,
it's about a sum of money
from the military command.
Am I asking too much?
No, for what they're sacrificing
it's even too little.
How will I recognize him?
He'll stop on the bridge
and whistle "Morning in Florence".
But of course, you don't know it.
- Well, no. How does it go?
- Like this...
It's common, yes.
Everybody sings it.
- Good day, reverend.
- Good day.
What do you want?
You don't have a San Antonio Abad,
by any chance?
Sorry, we did some time ago,
but they don't sell well.
I can offer you a San Roque.
Thanks, not interested.
Not interested in a saint
like San Roque?
Come with me.
Here it is, it's great work.
Alright, we'll see.
I'm off then, okay?
Yes, don't forget the piece
for Chiuraci.
I'll give you a good price.
I should talk to Francesco.
The man with
the tight shoes sent me.
Wait a moment.
Come in, reverend.
They're waiting for you.
Go down the stairs.
- Ah, you're Don Pietro.
- Hello.
What's happened?
Nothing serious, thank God,
but it could have.
The SS were at
Manfredi's place tonight.
We already know that,
but where is he?
- At your place.
- My place?
Yes, Pina opened up.
He'll stay a few days.
They gave me this note for you.
I wanted him to got to San Giovanni
and San Paolo with the passionists.
It would've been safer, but he
didn't want to be out of things.
But now it's more dangerous
than working while you're on file.
I know, reverend, but we're few
and if he's in a convent...
I understand.
Excuse me. Don Pietro,
it's our leader.
Pleasure to meet you.
The pleasure's mine.
I've heard a lot about you.
Yes, a shame for
my modesty and my health.
You've done a lot for us.
I'm grateful.
It's my duty to help
those in need. That's it.
Like to come over here?
Here, reverend.
Manfredi had told me
it's about a sum of money.
They're books, but there's
not much to read.
- They're all the same?
- A thousand pages.
- A million.
- Exactly.
- Who is it?
- Marina. It's me. Open up.
Hi.
Guess who I saw this morning.
- How should I know?
- Manfredi. He came to see me.
- To see you? Where?
- At my place.
Why did he go to your house?
What did he want?
He asked me to tell you
that for a few days
he won't be seeing you
and that he'll phone if he can.
- Nothing else?
- No.
He didn't explain?
No. I tell you.
I didn't ask either.
He caught me in my dressing gown
and rollers, imagine.
Aren't you going to change?
You're on next.
- How did he know where you live?
- How did he know?
You must have told him.
I never told him.
What do you want me to say?
I didn't tell him.
I don't like people knowing
where I live.
By the way, Marina,
I can't stay in that place.
If you don't mind,
I'll come and stay at your place
until I find a room.
Sure, whenever you like.
I've told you many times.
You're an angel.
- What are you looking for?
- A cigarette.
- I'll get it for you.
- Okay, okay.
Thanks.
- What time did you see him?
- See who?
Giorgio.
It was really early.
I still wasn't dressed.
5 minutes.
I don't get it.
Are you in love with him, or not?
He's friendly, no denying.
Do me a favor and
don't get involved.
Me? As long as you're happy.
- Are you sick?
- It's nothing.
Marina, not again?
- You know the harm it does.
- Rubbish.
So many things do us harm,
but we still keep doing them.
Coming.
- How are you?
- Fine, how about you?
How lovely you are this afternoon.
But you're always so elegant.
- Well, I'm off.
- Laureta.
Snap out of it, or the director
will be on to you.
- Excuse me, I'm on.
- Yes, dear.
- Have you got it?
- Yes.
You're wonderful.
He doesn't have a schedule.
He comes and goes, in and out.
In these times,
when you shouldn't
stick your neck out,
- his is all the way out.
- He's got his reasons.
- Good ones, we trust.
- Agostino, you shock me.
Give me a break.
You think I don't know
that little riot at the bakery
- was organized by you?
- Me?
Yes, you.
You think I'm an fool?
I see and hear everything,
and I know if you keep up this
fanaticism, anything could happen.
- We hope not.
- We hope.
- Cabbage soup.
- Yes, I can smell it.
What's the time?
Curfew starts at 5.
Let's see.
It 4.30.
- Right then, I've gotta go.
- You want to leave a message?
No, I just wanted to talk
to Don Pietro, but never mind.
I'll see him tomorrow,
before the wedding.
Here he is at last.
- Good afternoon, Don Pietro.
- Good afternoon, Pina.
I've told you a thousand times
not to cook on the heater.
And eating as well.
- Whatever you wish,...
- Agostino, don't answer back.
but we have to decide,
light the heater or the stove.
Always books. We don't have
money to buy food,
and he has to buy books.
Don't touch. I have to take them
to the priest at San Lorenzo.
You're going out again?
But curfew is in 20 minutes.
Doesn't matter. Doctors and
priests can move about.
Midwives, too.
I read it; in the dark,
it's easier for women
to get pregnant.
With so much crime about.
Don Pietro, I came for confession.
How can we do that?
I've got to go now.
All right, I'll come with you.
We can do it on the way.
- Give me the package. I'll take it.
- No, no.
A priest carrying a package?
Don't make me laugh.
It's light as a feather.
Come on, it's getting late.
Hurry, come with me.
- See you tomorrow, Agostino.
- And relax, okay?
If this war isn't over soon,
I'll go crazy.
- Are you the priest?
- Yes.
- Don Pietro Pelegrini?
- Yes.
I'd like to talk to you.
Wait a moment.
- I'll go then.
- Yes.
Well, you'd better...
- wait for me over there.
- Yes, alright.
Go in.
Go outside a moment.
Please.
As you please.
From Don Severio de Visita,
the priest for Nottuno.
Don't think I'm a coward,
but I can't take any more.
Don't let it get you down,
I'll try to help her.
Where are you from?
From Casino. It's hell.
What did that man want?
Leave it. Who was he?
Someone wanting information.
When I see one of them...
It's been so long since I confessed
I'm almost ashamed.
- No.
- Let me speak.
I know I've live badly,
done so many things
I shouldn't have.
But you think I'm ashamed to go
to the altar in this state.
But you can't understand,
Don Pietro.
There are things you do
without thinking,
without the impression
you're doing anything wrong.
I was so in love
and he is so good,
so brave.
I've often thought he could
find someone better than me.
Yes, a younger woman,
and not a widow with a boy almost
grown and no means of support
because I've had to sell
it all to survive,
to just keep going
and it's worse every day.
Who'll help us forget
all this suffering,
this anxiety and fear?
Maybe Christ doesn't see us.
So many have asked me that, Pina.
Christ doesn't see us?
But are we sure we don't
deserve this punishment?
Are we so certain we've always
lived according to God's laws?
First one only thinks of
changing life, improving things.
Later, when things don't go so well,
one becomes desperate and asks:
Maybe God isn't watching?
Maybe He has no mercy on us?
Yes, God has mercy on us,
but we have so many things
to forgive,
so must know how to pray
and forgive others.
You're right, but how?
Because, when..
I see someone like those over there
I want to jab them in the face.
Sure, you're right...
But, what things you make me say!
Give me the package,
I can't allow myself this now.
- Good afternoon, Pina.
- Good afternoon, Don Pietro.
I wanted a connection.
The Germans had taken her
boyfriend to the station.
I'll take care of her,
I told him.
She had a pair of tits on her.
Halt! Hands up!
Got your pass?
Printer.
- Printer?
- Yes, check my papers.
- Alright. Go home, and fast.
- Thank you.
Goodnight, captain.
Thank you.
Don't forget, I'll pick you up
tomorrow. Sleep tight.
Francesco, you frightened me.
I'm a bit late because
he insisted on taking me home.
Nothing bad happened, okay?
Hey, Francesco!
- Everything went well, eh?
- This time, yes.
The boss and old Nanina
were magnificent.
Know who came back this morning
and searched the house?
They wasted their time.
There was nothing.
Don Pietro told me
Pina opened up.
- Yes, she's been very kind.
- What do you think?
You're doing well marrying her.
At first, she took me for a cop
and treated me very badly.
I can imagine.
- Know Don Pietro has met Gino?
- Yeah? I'm glad.
- Has he told you about my business?
- He's worried.
He had to meet up with
the Old Man.
When did he arrive?
Last night,
but you mustn't see him.
Gino said you have to break contact
with the center for a while.
He's right, but there's too much
work to just hang around.
I don't understand how they
fished me out.
I've got to find out
what they really know about me.
We'll try, but it's hard to get
information from the police station.
We're hoping Don Pietro's met up
with our friend from Italia Corsi.
We hope so.
I brought you the paper.
It's come out well, hasn't it?
- How many copies?
- 12,000.
That'll be Pina.
Hi, how are you?
- I'm worried about Marcello.
- What's he done?
- Gone missing.
- Missing?
Yes. I've looked all over
the building and he's not here.
- He'll be with Remoleto.
- No way, he's not upstairs.
And Otelo, the son of the Sicilian,
Mrs. Tergel,
isn't upstairs either.
- What have they gotten into?
- I'm afraid that they've gone out.
At this hour, with the curfew?
Bravo! I'm proud of you all.
Hurry up, guys.
Let's wait for the others.
- Good night.
- Bye.
I'll kill you.
Where have you been?
If I had a father like that...
Your mother's son!
What time is this to come home?
We'd better go in one by one.
You're right. You go first.
Here you are, you rascals.
They're back.
Little rogues.
You'll be the death of me!
I'll go and see what
Marcello has to say.
- Look how they've come home.
- Where have you been?
- With Remoleto.
- Not true. Nobody was upstairs.
- We were below.
- Below where?
I'm going to kill them.
Little bastards.
Calm down.
I can't take any more.
They driving me mad.
They're just boys.
Shut up for once. Can't anyone
get some peace in this damn house.
I work all day.
- Yeah, some job.
- What did you say?
Speak up, speak your mind.
- Better you went to bed.
- Why?
Can't I speak in my own house?
This is my house, and if you want
to talk, do it in your room.
I pay for the kitchen too.
Shut up, Laureta.
I'm sick of living among workers.
Then get out, who's stopping you?
How come you're always fighting?
This is the last time, I assure you.
If she doesn't go,
one day or another...
Sister, the oven.
The Holy Virgin! It'll have burnt.
All because of that hysterical...
Come here.
It's a surprise. My sister
is baking a cake for tomorrow,
for the wedding.
You're not...
going to argue at the last moment?
No.
Because we're going to put on
a big spread.
- Grandad is happy.
- Let's go to bed.
- Good night.
- Turn out the light, please.
- We did well, didn't we?
- Yes, but you never take me.
- Sure, because you're a woman.
- And women...
can't be brave?
Yeah, sure they can,
but Remoleto says women
always bring problems.
He's caught us.
Can't you sleep?
Not yet.
Where did your friend
Remoleto take you all?
I can't say.
Not even to me?
No, it's a secret.
Then you're right
not to tell anyone.
Good night.
Hey.
What's up?
Is it true that from tomorrow
I can call you Dad?
- If you like.
- Yeah, I love you.
What's the matter?
I had a fight with my sister.
- Again?
- She wants to leave.
She said she's not even
coming to our wedding.
It's just things people say.
No, she was serious.
She's packing her bags.
She'll change her mind tomorrow.
- I'm tired.
- Don't cry.
I'm so tired.
Come on, let's go inside.
Giorgio's in there, I don't want to.
What does it matter? He's a friend.
I know, but I've wanted
to talk to you for some time.
What about?
Come, let's sit on the stairs.
Like when we first talked,
remember?
Sure I do. You had the nerve to
bang on my door in such a rage.
No wonder. You'd decided to
hammer some nails...
and knocked down my mirror,
though it didn't break.
"Who do you think you are,
King of the Universe?
I didn't like you at all.
You were living here 2 months
and when we passed each other
you never said hello.
2 years have gone by.
How far it seems,
how different everything is.
- Though we were already at war.
- Yes.
Everybody thought
it was going to end soon,
and then we'd just
watch it at the movies.
- Instead...
- When will it be over?
There are times when
I can't take any more.
It seems like we'll never
get out of this hell.
It'll be over, Pina,
and spring will come back,
and it'll be even more beautiful
because we'll be free.
We have to believe in it.
We have to really want it.
You'll see. I know these things,
I feel them, but I don't know
how to explain them to you.
Giorgio knows how to get it done.
He's a skilled man. He's studied
and traveled a lot.
He knows how to speak well.
But I believe it's like that.
We mustn't be scared of
today or tomorrow
because we're on the right path,
- we're in the right, understand?
- Yes, Francesco.
We're fighting for something
that has to come,
that's impossible not to come.
Maybe the road is long and hard,
but we'll get there
and we'll see a better world.
And above all,
our children will know it,
Marcello and him,
the one we're waiting on.
So, you mustn't be afraid,
ever, Pina,
whatever happens.
- You promise?
- Yes, Francesco,
but I've never been afraid, ever.
Hello?
Oh, it's you, ma'am.
We haven't seen him.
But he hasn't phoned,
or sent anyone?
Nanina, tell me the truth.
Do you know anything?
I don't know ma'am, I swear.
If I did, I'd tell you.
We hope not.
Good night.
That girl's a fool
asking for news over the phone.
She wants to turn us all in
to the cops.
Come in.
- Chief of Roman Police, sir.
- Show him in.
Dear friend,
a great moment has come.
I have very interesting information.
Our Manfredi has been seen
this morning in the Predestino area.
- Please.
- Thank you.
And a short time ago
a device exploded
in a carriage full of gasoline
at the rail crossing in the zone.
Excuse me, Major, but my news
is much more extraordinary
than yours.
I've spent most of the afternoon
in the central barracks,
and I too have made
an interesting discovery.
Great.
"Ferraris, Luigi. Born, Turin,
Oct. 3, 1906,
detained in Poland Feb. 4, 1928.
Sentenced to 12 years
for conspiracy
against the statutory
powers of the State,
escaped during transfer.
On file in Paris and Marseille."
Luigi Ferraris!
You've beaten me.
I'd never allow it, sir.
There's still the most
important task, to catch him.
Don't you doubt it.
He won't escape from me.
- Want me to take care of it?
- No, I forbid it.
That is to say,
it's not that I don't trust your
methods, but I prefer mine.
Excuse me.
Ingrid?
- Good afternoon. How are you?
- Dear madam.
Thank you for the flowers
and the coffee.
You corrupt my people,
but I forgive you.
He has just made
a very interesting discovery.
Really?
Enough of words.
Time to act.
Let me do it.
Good morning.
Good morning, boys.
Praise be to God.
May He be praised always.
Praise be to Jesus Christ.
May He be praised always,
but you're always
the last to praise Him.
- Who is it?
- The law.
Morning, officer.
Wait a moment.
I'm getting dressed.
Then meanwhile, with your permission
we'll congratulate your future wife.
Francesco!
Francesco, look!
- Sergeant...
- Sir...
- Interrogate those men.
- Yes, sir.
They're surrounding the house.
Don't show your face.
You, over there.
Get them out of their houses
and bring them to the square.
You, the same on the other side.
Marcello!
- What's up, Andreina?
- The Germans and the Fascists!
- Where?
- Our place.
Come on, guys.
Steady on. Wait a moment.
The Germans, don't you understand?
Don't move. I'll go
and see what's happening.
- We have to go.
- I said stay here, understand?
Don Pietro, we've got
some bombs in the attic.
Hurry, don't hang about.
The Germans are here.
Francesco's gone to Tulio's to
get rid of some documents.
Don't worry, he'll take care of it.
- Don't say anything to Pina.
- Don't worry, I won't.
- What are you doing here?
- Getting my washing.
Get out, nobody'll touch it.
That's why we're here.
How silly of me.
I had no idea.
Come on, hurry up.
Get yourself over there.
- And Francesco, where is he?
- He's safe.
Look, those scum are
taking out the sick, too.
Can't you walk any faster?
My grandad won't come down.
Don't hurt him.
Don't worry. Go over there.
Quick, quick.
Oh, my God, my son!
Why have they taken him?
- Where has he hidden?
- Upstairs.
It's all my fault.
I'll never forgive myself.
Impossible!
In such a big building, not one man.
Where are the men who live here?
Didn't you hear?
Where are the men?
What do I know?
I'm not the caretaker.
Halt! What's a priest doing here?
What does he want?
Where are you going?
A sick man needs comfort.
He's the local priest. Don't worry,
we've taken him out
for a little air.
Impossible, a man so ill.
I have to go up.
Hold it.
Are these visiting hours, reverend?
The poor man hasn't stopped calling.
He'll be dead by now.
Hold on, what's the story?
They've brought everyone down.
Not this one.
He's an old paralytic,
go up, reverend, and make it quick.
What service! Once we called
the fire department and...
Remoleto!
Remoleto, open up. It's me.
I've come with Don Pietro.
Get out of here, go!
Open up, Remoleto.
If you don't, you'll get blown
sky high with me!
Open up, I tell you.
What are you doing?
Nothing. I'm going to kill them all.
You want to cause a massacre?
Give me that.
Help!
Help!
Let me go!
Let me go!
What floor is this dying man on?
I don't know, the 3rd, the 4th...
I'm going up,
I've got medical knowledge.
I'll go with you.
No, I'll go alone.
I don't like a mob.
No one here.
Let's look on the floor above.
The door, the door.
What are you doing here?
I'm alright.
I'm alright.
I don't need you now.
I've decided to live
another 100 years.
- They're coming.
- Who's coming.
- Who's coming?
- The Germans.
I laugh in the face of
the Germans and Fascists.
Give me that.
Look over there.
Come on, grandad.
Give me
Come back, wake up.
Don Pietro, you really
gave him a good one!
You're very pretty!
Francesco!
Pina!
Let me go, you bastard.
Mom!
Answer him.
Wait for my signal.
- Flavio?
- What's up?
We've brought you some meat.
- Where is it?
- Here.
And what do I do with this?
I'm an inn-keeper,
not a butcher.
We're butchers.
Yes, I know, you're specialists.
Ah, Engineer.
Good evening, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.
Good evening, Engineer.
The lady's waiting for you.
Come on.
Giorgio, at last.
I've look everywhere for you.
I was sure you'd come here.
- But, what's happened?
- Nothing. Why?
Should something have happened?
- I don't understand, sorry.
- But, because of your house...
May I? A friend of mine.
Sit down, Francesco.
Pleasure to meet you, Marina.
- The SS came, didn't they?
- Who told you?
The caretaker.
What were they looking for?
I don't know.
Because I'm an officer.
Where are you going to sleep?
I don't know. We'll go
to a friend's house tonight.
- Why not come to my place?
- No, not your place.
Why not?
I don't want to bother you.
Also, I'm with him.
You can stay in the living room
and sleep on the sofa.
You'll be fine.
- Spaghetti for everyone?
- Well, we'll talk about it.
- Tickets, please.
- I don't have any.
- I'll give you some of mine.
- Thank you.
For second course?
Go to the kitchen.
I'll attend to them.
- They've detained Meseti.
- When?
This morning at 6.
The painter told me.
If we don't lay low for a while,
everyone'll be hunting for us.
- Flavio?
- Yes?
Was it his place
you wanted to sleep?
Someone talked.
Poor animals.
There's an American station
on at this time
that broadcasts jazz.
Shall we have a drink, boys?
I was given a bottle of Chianti.
This will warm us up a bit.
Thanks.
Do you feel ill?
He's got a fever.
Giorgio, he's burning up.
- I'll get the bed ready.
- Don't bother.
Cheer up, Francesco.
Help me, Giorgio.
He'll be very comfortable.
When he goes to bed,
I'll give him a pill for the fever.
Please, hand me that blanket.
You've got to be careful.
There's a flu about.
These days, it's the only
thing that goes round.
Who's that at this hour?
Who is it?
- It's me, Laureta.
- Oh, it's you.
Hi, darling.
See? I'm here at last.
I finally decided to break free,
but I told her...
- You're drunk.
- Yes, just a bit.
Then go to bed.
Who's here? Is anyone here?
The engineer.
Go to bed, Laureta.
I'm not going to eat him.
Francesco. What are you doing here?
Pina thrown you out
on the first night?
I think Marina's right.
Take her to bed.
- Come on.
- What a welcome.
I'd have preferred stay with Fritz.
I'll tell Pina when I see her.
Go to bed, you've got a fever.
I'll get a pill.
I fought with my sister.
I won't go back home.
- Marina.
- Come in.
Don't look at me, Engineer.
Where are the pills?
Look in that drawer.
There should be a pill box.
That fool's all we needed.
And now, what do we do?
Where are you going to sleep?
I'll make do in the lounge,
in the armchair.
You'll be uncomfortable
and cold. How infuriating!
Hello?
It's you. Good evening.
How are you, darling?
I was waiting for your call.
Why's that? You not alone?
You see?
Is he there?
Oh, little Laureta.
Yes, she's come to stay
with me a few days.
No.
No. Yeah, sure.
Very well.
We'll call each other tomorrow.
Good night.
Why do you have morphine
in your handbag?
What?
Oh, yes.
It's from the dentist, when that
tooth hurt me so much, remember?
No, I don't remember.
Sure you do.
This one here.
I applied it to relieve the pain.
- And it still hurts?
- Not for some time.
But to be sure,
you always carry it.
I wanted to return it
to the dentist.
That explains it.
What are you doing?
Keeping it. I'll go with you
to the dentist.
Give it to me.
Here.
You could lose it
and it's so expensive.
Why do you look at me like that?
Giorgio, you don't think...?
I don't think anything.
You're free to do
what you want with your life.
I've got no rights over you.
Who am I?
Someone who passed a moment
in your life.
- You mean one of many.
- I didn't say that.
No, but you thought it.
Sure, I've had lovers.
What did you want me to do?
How do you think I bought
this furniture,
my clothes, everything?
On my salary?
That's just for
stockings and cigarettes.
I've had to wake up,
like everybody else.
- That's life.
- Life's what we want to make it.
Words.
Life is dirty, filthy.
I know misery
and it scares me.
If I hadn't done
what I've done,
now I'd be married to
a tram driver and hungry,
my children and me.
Poor Marina.
Do you think happiness is
a fancy house,
pretty clothes
and rich lovers?
I would've changed
if you'd really loved me,
but you're like the rest,
worse even. At least they
didn't preach at me.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Giorgio!
Arguing again so as not to
break the habit.
You were eavesdropping,
naturally.
Of course not, but I heard.
You hear everything here.
Tomorrow we'll go to Don Pietro.
He's offered to hide me
in the convent for a while.
- We'll go together.
- No, not me. I can't.
I've got to work now,
more than ever.
She's dead.
I understand.
Look Francesco,
right now
you're desperate.
You might do something rash.
You might do more harm
than good.
Don't be afraid that
the time won't come.
The struggle is long,
and ours has hardly begun.
Here's your pill.
Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Marina?
- What do you want?
Maybe Manfredi's right,
we are stupid.
Shut up and go to sleep.
A man says he's waiting for you.
Yes, let him in.
Come in, please.
- Morning, Don Pietro.
- Morning, I was waiting for you.
We've done your meat.
"Giovanni Episcovo".
I've taken off 2 years.
Thanks.
Who's that?
The Austrian.
Didn't Francesco tell you?
- That's right.
- He's a good person.
May I? This is the man
who'll come with us.
- A pleasure.
- A pleasure.
I spoke to the prior at the convent.
He's waiting for us.
- And Francesco?
- Outside on the patio with Marcello.
Come, we have to hurry.
Give me...please.
Thank you.
I'll be back late.
When will you stop
getting into trouble?
You and the boy have supper
and go to bed.
I won't be able to sleep.
Oh, Don Pietro.
What do you want?
If I have to feed the boy,
I'll need...
I understand.
- Here. Is that enough?
- But that leaves you nothing.
- No, I've got some.
- Yes, I thought so.
We won't see each other
for a while,
but I'll be back
we'll be together always.
- Let's go, Francesco.
- Coming.
Papa!
You might get cold.
Mom gave it to me.
Hello? Very well.
Yeah.
Good.
Your information was correct.
Congratulations.
Your information was correct.
Congratulations.
You like it? Try it on.
Do it, darling.
Marvellous.
Look at yourself, Marina.
- Have they arrested him.
- Yes.
- What will they do to him?
- Nothing bad.
We need certain information.
As soon as he talks,
we'll let him go free.
- And if he won't?
- Nonsense.
Don't worry, he'll talk.
And if he doesn't?
Why wouldn't he talk?
Sure, why not?
- Do you love him?
- Me?
I don't love anybody.
Why are you so evasive
with me tonight?
Let me go.
No, you're staying
with me tonight.
No, I don't want to.
I don't want any more. Let me go.
But Marina, why?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Number, please.
Number four.
Thank you.
Go on!
Let's go!
Halt!
Get in there!
Did they hurt you, Don Pietro?
- No. And my glasses?
- They're broken.
Patience.
Thank you.
It's my fault.
They must have followed me.
I'd say the opposite.
I think they've been
spying on me for some time.
You didn't have to come with me.
Quiet. The walls have ears.
So what, for what
we have to say?
Isn't that right, Don Pietro?
Yes. We've nothing to say.
Did you hear them?
That's us, too.
We'll be screaming like that.
Stay calm.
We found this
in the priest's bedroom.
And these are
the prisioners' documents.
Forged, of course.
- Did you search the sacristy?
- Yes, top to bottom.
- Did you seen anyone?
- No, Major.
Only the sexton and a boy,
but they were terrified.
I'm sure they wouldn't dare talk.
You're wrong, they will talk.
- Take all this away.
- Yes, Major.
You're not afraid?
Yes, very,
but at the same time, calm.
It's strange, isn't it?
I don't know why that is.
You're all crazy.
Listen, I know,
I know you've got
something to hide.
Human lives depend on your silence.
You think your able to
resist their torture.
You don't know it, but
they turn the bravest men
into cowards.
We're not heroes,
but no one's going to find out
anything, I can tell you that.
- What's the time?
- Half past eight.
We've got to make them talk
before curfew ends
and the subversives find out
that we caught them.
We've got ten hours.
- Kramer.
- Major.
Turn off the lights.
Come in.
Please.
What's your name?
Giovanni Episcovo.
Right.
Episcovo, born in Bari,
salesman.
- Selling what?
- Oil and wine.
Oil and wine.
Well, Mr. Episcovo,
if I could spend the time,
I'd enjoy very much
talking about your business,
but I'm in a hurry,
and so, with all due respect,
allow me to offer you a proposition.
I know all about you,
your real name and your
past political activity.
As for the present,
I know from my informers
that you're one of the main
heads of the military command
of the National Committee,
and you're in with
the Bradogliano military core.
I have the overriding need
to know all the details
of this organization
and you are just the man
to give it to me.
You said you know who I am,
you know of my activities,
past and present.
Then why offer me a proposition?
Why do you think you can
turn me into a spy?
I know that in this office
there have the same propositions
to various Italian generals,
the Bradoglianos, as you call them,
who have given their lives
for their silence,
and I will not betray them.
I hope.
I do regret to see such a
reasonable offer rejected,
but I'll tell you what I expect.
The Italians, whatever party
they are in,
are full of rhetoric.
I'm sure that before dawn
we'll come to some agreement.
Cigarette?
Come on, it won't be
a cigarette that makes you talk.
They say so many strange things
about the Gestapo.
Come in.
You!
Stay calm, my son.
Try to pray.
We found this material
in your bedroom.
Right.
It's evident that your aim
was to attack the Reich
and it's armed forces.
My aim was not exactly that.
What would you call a man
who not only supplied
false documents
and hid Italians preparing attacks
on our soldiers,
but also gave asylum
and aid to German deserters?
A man who despite everything
tries to exercise charity.
A loathsome traitor
who ought to be punished
according to the laws of war
of the Reich.
It will be as God wishes.
Then listen to me carefully:
Your friend Episcovo
is one of the heads
of a military organization
of which you, too,
are well aware.
If you manage to
convince your friend
to talk as well,
you'll have fulfilled your duty
as a priest and citizen.
I'll explain why;
the men who prepare these
attacks and acts of sabotage
against the German armed forces
are violating the rights
of an occupying power,
guaranteed by
international treaties.
They are mere snipers
and therefore must be
brought to justice, is that clear?
Your words impress me deeply.
At last you understand.
- Kramer.
- Yes, Major.
Take down his statement.
- Yes, but there's a problem.
- What?
I personally have nothing to say,
because I don't know anything,
and the little I do know,
I heard at confession
and those secrets must die with me.
It's part of our discipline.
I'm not interested in
your discipline.
But someone above you and I
is interested.
Then convince your friend to talk.
I don't think he knows
anything that you suspect.
Do you want me to believe you know
nothing of his real activity,
his real identity?
I only know that he's a man
that needed my modest help.
I'll tell you now who this man is:
a subversive, an atheist!
I'm a Catholic priest
and I believe that whoever
fights for justice and freedom,
walks the path of the Lord,
and the paths of the Lord
are infinite.
Not thinking of giving me
a sermon, I suppose.
It's not my intention.
Listen, I don't have
time to waste.
Have you decided to talk?
Can't you at least
try to convince
your companion?
I'm talking about
avoiding a suffering
that you can't even imagine.
I imagine better
than you think,
but I think it would be futile,
and if this man is who you say,
it'll be hard to get him to talk,
don't you think?
Don't you worry, he'll talk.
- I don't think he will talk.
- You believe so?
He won't talk.
I will pray for him.
You won't get anything
asking your Eternal Father.
This will take a while.
I'll be in the officer's room.
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, Major.
Come in.
Major, the traitors have been hung.
Idiot!
- Who's winning.
- Guess who, for a change.
Got much work tonight?
Not much, but interesting.
Really? Concerning what?
I've nabbed a man who
has to talk before morning.
And an Italian priest
who claims he won't talk
because he'll pray for him.
- And if he doesn't talk?
- Nonsense.
But if he keeps quiet?
If he keeps quiet,
it would mean an Italian
is equal to a German,
and there's no difference
between the blood of an inferior
and a superior race.
Men are divided in this way.
25 years ago, I led
firing squads in France.
I was a young officer then,
and I thought like you,
that we belonged to
a superior race,
but the French preferred us
to execute them
than tell us anything.
We'll never understand that
people want to live in freedom.
- You're drunk, Hartmann.
- Yes, I'm drunk.
I get drunk
every night to forget,
and why?
To see things clearly.
We don't know anything
apart from killing.
Killing.
We've covered Europe in corpses.
And these graves slowly
breed hate,
hate everywhere.
We'll be annihilated by hate.
There is no hope.
Shut up.
We'll all die,
die without hope.
I forbid you to continue
talking. You are rambling.
No hope...
I forbid you...
Have you forgotten
you are a German officer?
- Has he talked yet?
- No, Major.
Wendel says he's never
seen such stubborness.
He's reached total
insensibility.
What do we do, Major?
Well, Wendel?
Practically impossible, Major.
We have to wait till
he recovers a little.
Impossible. There's no time.
Maybe psychological methods,
Major.
You're mad. He's got to talk.
The injection.
Mister Ferraris,
as I've said,
I have a lot of respect for you,
I really do, believe me,
this proof of your courage,
and your spirit of sacrifice,
but you must understand
it's useless to continue.
You're a Communist.
Your party has a pact
of alliance
with the forces of reaction,
now united against us,
but tomorrow, when Rome
is occupied,
or liberated, as you say,
do you think those monarchists
will still be your allies?
I'm offering to settle
the problem;
give me the names of
the Bradogliano generals,
set up the arrests,
and I guarantee your freedom,
and amnesty for the members
of your party,
are we agreed, Mister Ferraris?
I told you he wouldn't talk so easily.
Got a cigarette?
The priest, quick.
Look at that.
Are you satisfied?
Is that your christian charity?
Is that love for your
'brother in Christ'?
You prefer to see him reduced
to a pulp rather than talk.
Don't think you'll save yourself,
you hypocritical priest,
or your accomplices.
You'll get a traitor's end,
we'll destroy you down to
the very last one.
You haven't talked.
It's over.
It's over.
You wanted his soul and
you've destroyed his body.
Bastards!
Bastards!
You'll be stamped into the mud
like miserable worms.
Bastards!
My God, what have I said?
Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.
Get out of here.
Bring the priest.
Quick.
Stupid Italians...
Damn it!
That priest has ruined
all my plans.
I told you it wouldn't be so simple.
You're always right.
Major, what do I put on the form?
Ah, yes, cause of death.
- Heart attack.
- At your orders.
What do I do with her?
She's your affair.
Let her rest.
We'll see about her later.
Come on. I need a drink.
Excuse me, sir.
What name do I fill in?
- Manfredi or Ferraris?
- Just Episcovo.
Giovanni Episcovo.
If we don't want another martyr.
We already have enough.
Just a second, please.
That way, I can use it again.
We're not a superior race.
What's the time?
- 8.15, sir.
- Exactly.
- They're late.
- Yes, sir. They are late.
- Like a cigarette?
- Thank you, sir.
Give me a light.
Line up.
Hurry.
- Your hat, Don Pietro.
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Be brave.
It's not hard to die well.
The hard thing is to live well.
Fire!
God, forgive them.
