There is a man who was
born with the blood of...
...a wild beast coursing
through his veins.
...so it was said.
This man, kindred of the wolves...
...ignoring danger,
self-interest and vanity...
He walks the savage path alone...
With his gaze set on the fires of Hell...
His fangs tear the seal to destruction.
People say...
His accursed fate was
the cause of it all.
<i>DEADLY OUTLAW REKKA</i>
Normally we don't charge people for
interfering with official duties.
Incidents happen all the time.
You need to calm down.
Father!
What are you doing, Kunisada?
The bathroom is over there.
Well Tabata?
How did it feel to take them all on?
Yes, Sanada really was
a fearsome leader...
I was scared!
I was seriously terrified of him.
It's about time you made
a name for yourself too.
Yes, I'm sorry...
I'm learning from "Mr. Su, the
killer" but I lost my shit.
Stop calling me Mr. Su!
Sorry.
Okay...
Let's get our reward from Mr.
Nakajyo and head to the hot springs.
What do you say to that, Tabata?
Might as well go to Hawaii,
or somewhere overseas.
You're a big spender, kid.
But we took out the
head of the Sanada Group!
The Otaki Group's at the top now.
Let's reap the rewards from them.
It's not that easy...
There's more to it than that.
They came off.
That feels good...
What?
Why are all of you looking so glum?
Sorry, Chairman.
Sorry to come and bother
you when you were busy.
Well, Chairman...
A guy from the branch family took
out the head of the Sanada Group.
Huh?
If the Sanada Group decides to take
revenge it's going to be raining blood!
Before that happens, we
need to ask the Head Kanbu...
...of the Bando Family
to mediate this situation.
At this rate we're heading straight
for war against the Sanada Group...
Bando...
Call Hijikata, Head
Kanbu of the Bando Family.
As for the fee to have Hijikata Kanbu
of the Bando Family as a mediator...
We need to ready fifty million yen.
Akemi!
The Chairman...
Akemi, bring some water!
Yes, I know.
Open your mouth.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
What's the executive division doing?
The Chief said not to make a move.
Ready all the weapons you can.
Of course.
What is it?
Congratulations on your release.
Hey Kuni, make sure you
don't pull anything funny.
Negotiation for a truce is underway
with the Bando Family mediating.
If it falls apart, it's going to be war.
If that happens, there's going
to be dead bodies everywhere.
Are you listening?
Huh?
Hey Shimatani.
What is it?
What?
Good luck.
For what?
I received a message from Kugihara
of the Sanada Group in secret.
He said they're wiling
to accept a truce.
I plan to speak to Kugihara
face to face on this matter then.
Kugihara has no choice but to talk...
Now that their leader is dead.
Furthermore, Mr. Hijikata...
I beg your assistance
in settling this matter.
I'm back.
You're late.
Sorry.
Pardon my intrusion.
Would you like something to eat?
No thanks.
Okay.
Our group and the Otaki group
have been quarreling for years.
Some of the members think it's
a good time to call a truce.
What do
you say...
Boss...
We're the Yakuza.
What kind of nonsense
are they talking about?
Come on Kuni, that's no
way to talk to the boss.
Are you scared, Chief?
If you don't have the balls to go to
war, then you'd better go straight.
Well Iguchi?
What did you just say?
Why you!
Cool it.
I'll kill you!
Try it!
Kuni...
Let go!
Sit down.
You settled it like it was child's play.
Kuni, you were locked up
when you were most needed.
He'll snap at anyone.
It's the late boss's fault
for spoiling him like that.
I know he was the son of one
of his closest followers, but...
It's not the boss's fault...
It's genetics.
His late yakuza father was
more than a handful too.
Boy, did he snap easily.
I'm not surprised he was showered
with bullets and killed in an ambush.
It's his Korean blood.
You can't reason with those
types once they're angry.
In this day and age...
He knew the consequences.
I can't accept this.
Listen Arata.
Our group decided to call a truce...
...and I agreed to it.
What's done is done.
You shouldn't waste your life
for someone who's dead, okay?
But we were...
Father and son.
You call that father and son?
The only bond you two had was an
allegiance bound by symbolic drinks.
If you throw away your life
because you feel like you owe him...
That would piss me
off more than anything!
Life isn't just about living long.
I never raised you
to be so unreasonable!
Arata!
Godmother...
Are you telling me to be scum?
Take this to His Honor at Hakone.
Tell him it's a keepsake.
Yes.
You would have rather gone
to war than call a truce?
Where's the upside to spending a
lot of money, having people die...
...and tightening the authority's
noose around our own necks?
Tell me Mr. Kugihara,
what merit is there?
There's an order of
events in this world!
You settled everything
before we could act.
I had no choice...
By the time your Group
decides what to do...
I'd be a white haired geezer.
Quit your excuses.
Company restructuring is
the norm now in society.
It was about time the
Elder Leader retired.
Mr. Hijikata from the Bando
Family said the same thing, too.
So...
I've done our part for your group...
Now it's your turn.
You'll get rid of ours...
Right?
Mr. Kugihara?
It's already begun.
There's no turning back now.
Your Honor, I would like to
express my deepest gratitude...
...for you coming to
my father's funeral.
I've brought this hoping you would
accept it as a keepsake of my father.
A word from an old man...
Cherish your life.
Sorry to trouble you, Uncle.
Stop calling me uncle.
I've gone straight.
You're still an uncle to me.
I'm a businessman now, I
work for His Honor in secret.
Make sure you don't
do anything reckless.
Yes.
Hey.
Welcome back.
How was it?
I've managed to collect
sixteen million and...
What are you doing?
Anyway, it'll only take another
week to collect the rest.
We're collecting for our own reasons.
Make sure you don't bully our
customers too much all right?
It's fine.
Nomoto Lenders will be
taking over their loans.
Brother...
What?
What's wrong?
I don't have a weapon.
Just keep doing the grunt work.
Hope it works out nice.
Yeah.
Brother, are you seriously
planning to attack the Otaki Group?
An eye for an eye.
It's going to cause a lot of trouble,
not only with the Otaki Group but...
...the Bando Family was the mediator.
They won't to sit back and watch.
So what?
Father's dead.
Who cares what happens.
You guys pull out now.
I'm going alone.
I can't let you.
I'm a part of you.
Hey Brother. I saw it on
TV but it's a handy trick.
Apparently it's good to
wrap your hair with this.
Are you sure?
Can I do it?
Hey, help me out.
Get it right!
That looks good.
Pass me the seaweed.
This seaweed is from my parents.
There's more than enough to go around.
Scoop me another bowl.
A big scoop?
Yeah.
Ow! Hot!
Are you all right?
Hey.
Half of his.
Thanks for the food!
<i>Same here.
Thanks for the food!</i>
What's this?
It's a little something
to make us happy.
Aren't we doing well?
Come inside and have a drink.
Sure.
There's no point in
dwelling on what happened.
We need to enjoy life.
That's the spirit, relaxing
is an important part of life.
Nothing good will happen
if you keep snapping.
Yeah.
Hey, hey hey...
What's this?
You girls are too relaxed!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
They're Myung Hyung and Sung Hee.
They're from Pusan.
Long story short, they
ended up here with me.
They're good girls as long
as they don't drink, but...
Are you having fun Miss?
Don't look so surprised. Myung Hyung.
Arata's dad is Korean.
Wanna go out on a date with me, Miss?
Hey!
Come on, wake up!
Come with me.
Here, come on.
Brother, let's party!
Right here!
Here you go!
Let's have a foursome next time, okay?
Idiot.
Foursome, okay?
Wanna give me a kiss?
Kuni!
Kuni, you were right.
I had a talk with the Boss afterwards.
If we're forced to call a
truce we're going to lose face.
We need to take out the
head of the Otaki Group...
...or else it's not going to add up.
Are you serious, Chief?
Yeah, we got to do what we got to do.
The Boss agreed too.
No truce. It's going to be
all out war with the Otaki.
You know that right?
The Sanada Group has an image
and we can't lose face.
That's what you get when
you rush into a truce.
That's why the Sanada
Group's name is taken lightly.
I know, I've heard enough about that.
Well?
What's next?
The Boss and I will ready
the troops and funds.
I want you to take charge and take
out the heads of the Otaki Group.
You got it, Chief...
But I don't need any men.
Have them gather information for me.
I want to know exactly where Otaki
is and the number of guards he has.
Make sure you get that info for me.
I appreciate it Kuni, I'm going
to take you up on that offer.
Kuni!
What happened to your hair?
I needed a change.
Yeah, he's a crazy cobra.
He bit the bait the
minute he had a chance.
We had no choice...
We have to do it to survive.
Are you feeling guilty, Boss?
What about you?
Doesn't it pain you?
Hey.
Yes?
How much longer are you
planning to follow me around?
That question again?
Please...
I told you, I'm a part of you.
I'm telling you, this
time it's really dangerous.
Brother, you're the one who always
says, "Life isn't about living long."
You're going to die if
you keep following me.
Brother, let me make something clear.
I love your frankness.
I admire it!
There's no way I'm
going to leave your side.
By the way...
About Sabu, Hiroshi and Tomio...
I'll talk to them and make them go
back to their homes, so don't worry.
Make sure you give them some money.
Yes, I'll give them plenty.
Oh, they're here. We've
been waiting for you!
Brother, she said she's hungry.
All right, let's eat something.
Yeah, let's.
Hey!
Hey Cobra!
Enjoying your date?
Considering your boss was killed
you seem to be taking it pretty easy.
Hey, they called a truce.
Which group are you from, you bastards?
No one in the Sanada
Groups speaks up do they?
You guys from the Otaki Group?
Yeah, so what if we are?
Brother no!
Brother!
Damn, it's heavy.
Brother, stop it!
Brother!
Brother, stop!
Brother, that's enough!
Let go of me, you bastard!
Brother, come to your senses!
A brutal murder occurred, leaving three
dead and three in critical condition.
All victims belong to the Otaki
Yakuza Group based in Shinjuku.
Apparently they left
a nearby restaurant...
...and got into a quarrel
with the alleged suspect.
They were beaten with a crowbar
the suspect found on the premises.
The victims had been struck in the
back and stomach, beaten with the...
...weapon and, unbelievably,
dragged around by it.
They died a short
while after the beating.
According to witnesses...
Really...
He really caused an
unbelievable incident.
That idiot Kunisada.
Do you have any idea where he is?
To be honest, I want to save
him from the death penalty.
But if he keeps killing...
There's no doubt about it...
He'll be hung for sure...
I doubt Arata Kunisada is the
kind to accept a hanging quietly.
Mr. Hiraoka...
A long time ago his
father saved my life.
When I was young I went to the
Sanada Group's casino to investigate.
Then one of the Sanada
members tried to stab me.
Kunisada's father risked
his own life to shield me.
That's right. That happened, didn't it?
That's why I have a soft spot for him.
I'm sorry, but I don't
think I can help you.
You used to be a
Sanada Group member too.
You and Kunisada's father were brothers.
I've forgotten the past.
I see...
That's unfortunate.
Oh!
Did you know that two
girls are fleeing with him?
According to my sources
they look Korean.
Why can't we go with you?
Take us with you.
That's enough.
We're getting chased by the cops.
Go back home and keep a low profile.
It's your severance pay. Make
sure you give it to Tomio too.
I'll stay here and guard the house!
Yeah!
We can't go home after
all that's happened!
Don't mess with me, you bastard.
Please!
Don't you get it you asshole?
Please!
Mr. Shimatani!
I'm gonna kill you, assholes!
Got it?
Stop lingering around, you idiots!
Hiroshi...
Take the money and go home.
What are you going to do Sabu?
Me?
I'll wait for their return.
I'll stay too.
The bosses are up to something.
I can't leave them when
all this is going down.
Right?
Right?
Sorry but...
I'm out.
Please throw away my stuff.
Thank you for everything.
Hey.
It's going to cost you 1.5 million for
the weapons and getting rid of this car.
I know.
Here.
Hey old man, can you ready a car?
Ain't no way.
Ain't no way? I'll pay you.
You're a tough one, old
man. Here's another bundle.
Old man.
Take it!
How much longer are you
planning to follow us around?
If you don't leave I'll rape you!
Shimatani, say something will you?
Hey!
I'm going to another room with Sung Hee.
I'll make her understand. I just
need some time alone with her.
Can you take care of Myung Hyung please?
Right...
Kunisada...
Let's go to Hong Kong together.
Kunisada...
Let's go to Hong Kong together.
Kunisada...
Let's go to Hong Kong.
Let's go together.
Kunisada...
Let's go to Hong Kong.
Together...
Together...
Kunisada...
Kunisada...
Let's go together.
Sure.
Welcome.
You lied to me, Kunisada.
It's your fault for trusting a yakuza.
Kunisada, you liar!
The date's over.
Sorry for the trouble, Uncle.
Good girls, aren't they?
Sorry. I fucked her.
You idiot!
Let's go.
Kunisada...
Kunisada...
You idiot...
You can't be in this business if you're
afraid of people coming after you.
Right?
Yes.
Bring it on, bastards!
Chairman...
You've had enough to drink.
What are you talking about, you idiot?
The acid...
Whatever it's called...
This pickled plum is good for the heart.
Isn't it?
Here.
Get a hold of yourself.
I have to take a piss.
I got to go.
No, you idiot!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on!
Suck me off in the bathroom.
Wait here.
Ahh, yes...
Ah, that felt good...
You need to swallow it
all. You got some over here.
You son of a...
M- M-My
medicine...
What's wrong, Daddy?
No!
No...
No!
Chairman!
Chairman!
Go get a doctor!
You guys did a great job.
Nakajyo and Komuro are pleased too.
It's not much, but please accept it.
Thank you for all your
assistance with this matter.
Thank you very much.
We worked well together...
I'm relieved.
I'm really impressed by
Mr. Kugihara's planning.
You killed all the witnesses
including the guards and his mistress.
I'm impressed at how thorough you were.
Nakajyo, how's the Otaki Group doing?
What's your assessment? Do
you think we can call a truce?
Yes.
Some of the followers have
opposing opinions, but...
...I doubt it'll be a
problem if we contain it.
Sometimes things need
to be done by force.
Basically you need to give them
an outlet to blow off steam.
Right, Komuro?
Yes.
One way to settle this
and appease everyone...
...is by killing the
culprit, Arata Kunisada.
There you have it, Kugihara.
Does anyone have objections to
killing this thug named Kunisada?
Of course not...
That'll solve everything,
right, Kugihara?
The old men are gone...
And now the two of you can
be the head of your groups.
All that's left to do...
...is for the two of you
to swear allegiance to me.
Brother! A beetle!
This brings back memories!
Brother, it's a beetle.
Look! Doesn't it bring back memories?
Oh!
Really?
Take this!
And that!
Come on! They're worth money these days!
Yes, hello?
Who is it?
Can you hold on a minute?
Brother...
It's the Chief.
Yeah...
We're taking it easy.
Oh, really?
What did Iguchi say?
That he's going to hand
deliver ten million yen...
That should've been a given!
Hell must have frozen over.
Hey Kuni!
Looking good!
Well, I'm still alive so...
The Boss is really happy.
Real happy!
Bring the money.
Just stay in hiding.
Don't worry about money, leave it to me.
So what's been going on with
the Otaki Group since then?
We're in a heated deadlock,
it's a fragile situation.
And...
Truce talks went out the window, too.
By the way...
Why did you have to kill Otaki's woman?
What are you talking
about? It was you who...
The only one I shot was Otaki.
What?
You guys didn't trust me
so you sent another hitman.
What's this?
Hold on a sec.
What the hell is this?
Who are you?
Who do you think you're
shooting at! You bastard!
Who are you?
Say it, you bastard!
Are you with Otaki?
Tell me who you're with!
Don't take us lightly.
Say it!
Say it! Or else I'll torch your nose!
Are you with Otaki?
Say it!
I didn't ask you to
whimper, you bastard!
Tell me who you're with!
Otaki!
Fucking bastard.
Wait a minute...
Wait a minute...
Come on, Iguchi, answer
the phone, you bastard.
It's his voice mail.
What's going on?
Why'd Otaki's hitman show
up right after Iguchi...
Brother!
This doesn't make any sense!
I told you before! Kunisada's crazy.
We can't dismiss this
as a simple fuck-up.
He's dangerous!
Our Iguchi risked his
life for this plan.
Do you understand what
I'm saying, Mr. Nakajyo?
Now now, calm down both of you.
There's no need to get so
angry over a fuck-up or two.
That one fuck-up is going
to light Kunisada on fire.
On top of that we've lost 10 million!
Come on, there's no use
in crying over spilt milk.
That's not all.
You sent another squad to the hospital!
What?
You didn't trust us?
Better safe than sorry, right?
We're risking our lives too.
Now with this fuck-up, if the
group members hear about this...
...it's going to be our heads.
Anyway, concerning Kunisada...
We'll take care of him.
There's no point in whining about it.
We have no choice but to walk
to the depths of Hell together!
Got it?
There'll be a huge
backlash from Mr. Hijikata...
...if we keep quarreling
amongst ourselves like this.
We're going to be under the
Bando Family umbrella in the end...
Aren't we, Mr. Kugihara, Mr. Iguchi!
Really?
I see, that's no good.
Of course.
Sure, as long as I get my fee...
Yes...
Yes...
Yes, we'll speak later.
Hey Tabata.
Yes?
Mr. Nakajyo sure knows
how to crack the whip.
I'll be waiting, Eiichi.
You better not lie to me, okay?
Don't worry.
I can't live without you anymore...
Especially your pussy.
I'll be waiting.
Mr. Asai, I think they're playing dumb.
I doubt it...
Knowing Kunisada and his temper, he's
not one to drag the young guys in.
But don't you think he's contacted them?
The idiots are waiting around for him.
Stop over-analyzing.
Who are these guys?
They really piss me off.
Who are you?
It's the police.
Is Mr. Kunisada here?
The cops just left!
That's strange...
What do you think you're doing?
It's been a while so
I wanted to see you.
You wanted to see me? If you get
caught, you know you're finished right?
You killed Otaki too, didn't you?
Let's go for a walk.
What's going on with the
Otaki and Sanada groups?
They're acting like it's a bad joke.
They seem to be working together.
It sounds like a scheme plotted
by Nakajyo and the Bando Family.
They got it through Hijikata, the
number two henchman of the Bando Family.
Nakajyo from the Otaki group
killed the head of the Sanada group.
Then they dragged Kugihara in, the
guy they secretly had ties with...
...from the Sanada group
and had Otaki killed...
In other words, all the murders
were part of a dirty plot.
So that's what this is...
By the way, I want you
to tell me the truth.
After you killed Otaki, did you raid
the hospital room and kill his mistress?
I'm crazy, but not
enough to kill a woman.
Okay...
You've gotten your revenge.
Now go.
Some place far away
where we can't find you.
Thank you for your friendship.
Mr. Asai, I won't forget this.
What loyal watchdogs...
I mean really...
I've beaten them to a bloody
pulp but they won't talk.
Normally they'd be talking by now.
His young subordinates are this loyal...
This Kunisada must be one Hell of a guy.
No wonder the assassin
from Nakajyo failed.
They make me laugh.
They sent a cat to fight a tiger!
Wanna go?
Yeah.
Murdered:
Hiroshi Fujiwara, Saburo Sawada
Hey, how's the bath?
Good.
Use that and many will die.
Understand?
Hey!
Here's the instructions.
Take it.
It's in Chinese. You'll
need a dictionary.
"Relation priority"?
What the Hell is "Relation Priority"?
Brother! I can't read a Chinese manual!
Pull the trigger and
something will come out right?
<i>Bando Building</i>
<i>Bando</i>
That was fun, wasn't it?
Let's keep going!
Go!
Go!
Get out of my way!
Outta the way!
Jackpot!
Come on Brother, let's go!
Let's go!
We're out of here!
What the hell is taking you so long?
I've been put on emergency
guard since last night!
If your men took out Kugihara
when they were supposed to...
...we wouldn't be in this mess, would we?
There's no point in whining
about it now, you idiot!
We have to hunt him
down and finish him off!
You're the one who fucked up first!
If you had done what you were supposed
to, Iguchi wouldn't have had to die.
Shut the fuck up!
Old man Nakajyo just
chewed me out on the phone.
He made it sound like our
fault that Kunisada's alive.
They need to know hunting
a man isn't like fishing.
But I never knew a guy who
was so fucked in the head.
Normally people wouldn't fire a rocket
launcher into Bando Headquarters.
Sounds like a fun guy!
That's how an outlaw should be!
But it sounds like a real emergency.
Nakajyo was flipping out.
We're indirectly under Mr. Nakajyo.
No matter what kind of situation
the Nakajyo Group is in...
...it has nothing to do
with us, right Tabata?
Oh...
Please excuse me.
Where are you going?
I need to take a piss.
Don't be too long.
Yes, sir.
Do you really think he's
going to show up on enemy turf?
If I were him, Mr.
Nakajyo would be next.
You really think so, Mr. Su?
I said, stop calling me Mr. Su!
Sorry.
He's a fighter to the bone.
The only thing on his
mind is to get revenge.
Here we come, you bastard!
Let's do it!
Here it comes...
Oh yeah!
Yeah!
You like that?
Bastard!
That's for trying to
kill us, you bastards.
Holy shit!
Are we going to kill them now?
Let's enjoy it a little more.
It's hot!
Couldn't we get a car
with air conditioning?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Tabata.
Yes?
Should we use it?
Are you serious?
Damn you!
Piece of cake!
Brother, forget about me, and go!
I said go!
You're so cool, Mr. Su.
I said, stop calling me Mr. Su!
By the way, how is he doing?
Sanada's hot headed kid...
Yes.
Is he still alive?
He's as good as dead, I think...
For his foolish violent actions...
Maybe that's good, too.
Hmm?
Death is part of a man's training.
Rock and Roll!
