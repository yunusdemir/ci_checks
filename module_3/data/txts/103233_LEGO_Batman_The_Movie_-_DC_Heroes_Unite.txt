- Oh, after you.
-Ugh.
- You worried?
-Superman does not worry.
[BEEPING]

Right here.

[PEOPLE CHATTERING]
Lex, I'm surprised you took time away
from your presidential campaign...
...and came all the way
to Gotham City for this.
Oh, dear lady, as a nominee
it's my pleasure and privilege to be here.
- Especially if you win.
ALL: Ha-ha-ha.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.
We're here tonight to honor a great man.
A man who has proved time and again
his first priority is helping those in need.
This year's Man of the Year Award
goes to...
...Bruce Wayne.
[ALL CHEERING]
[BAND PLAYING DRAMATIC FANFARE]
Next year, buddy.
Despise that guy.
- Bruce, will you say a few words?
-Well, there's not much to say.
I do what little I can, since every once
in a while, everyone needs a helping hand.
Though I'm not sure I deserve
an award for it.
[JOKER LAUGHING]
JOKER:
You heard him, he doesn't deserve it.
Which is just as well,
since we've got a last-minute entry.
Who has been there for you?
One man, who has made it his mission
to improve the lives of people around him.
He has remodeled our buildings.
Helped keep our banks free
of unnecessary clutter.
[ZIPPER ZIPS]
JOKER: You have always shown
your appreciation.
OFFICER 1: Ha-ha-ha!
OFFICER 2: You're the <i>best,</i> Joker.
OFFICER 3: <i>We'll do anything for you.</i>
-Hmm.
JOKER:
And why stop now?
[LAUGHS]
[ALL SCREAMING]
A standing ovation? Did not expect that.
But I'll take it. And also everything else.
[MAN 1 CRYING]
[MAN <i>2</i> WHIMPERING]
Excuse me, sir.
I'm going to purloin your valuables.
[GRUNTS THEN LAUGHS]
Riddle me this.
What's green and found in your wallet?
- Money?
-Um, no. Not anymore!
[PENGUIN CHUCKLING]
Sorry to rain on your parade, my dear.
[LAUGHING]
Thanks so much.
Well, well, Lex Luthor,
presidential candidate...
...and Superman's least-favorite
bald person.
No, thanks. I don't wanna get joy buzzed.
Oh, don't worry,
I didn't want to shake hands.
I want your watch.
Nice running into you.
Let's do it again sometime.
Oh, we will.
ALL: Speech! Speech!
TWO-FACE: Come on, Joker!
- Tell us, come on!
-Ha-ha-ha!
What a night. Such an honor.
I'm speechless.
[LAUGHING]
Aw, who am I kidding?
When am I ever speechless?
Look at that face.
It's like, "What's he gonna say?
What's going to come out
of that mouth of his?"
Sorry to wipe that grin
off your face, Joker.
You're not sorry. You're not sorry at all.
Riddle me this, Batman.
What wears a mask and is unconscious?
You. Unh!

Ah! My kind of party.
Good food, good people,
good goody bags.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Batlame and Slobbin.
Why are you guys hanging around?
Ha! You see what I did there?
We're here to get
those valuables you stole, Joker.
- And Bruce Wayne's award.
-This is my award. It very clearly says me.
Joker!
You just...
But you just stuck that on there.
- Whoa!
-Robin, focus on your flying.
Sorry. Whoa!
[BEEPING]
Aw. I missed.
[BEEPING]
You like shark, Batman?
Because I think they're going to like you.
[BATMAN GROWLS

Oh, come on!
<i>ROBIN [OVER RADIO]: I can't keep up!
-I'll take it from here.</i>
[LAUGHING]
Huh?
[JOKER LAUGHING]
You like missiles, Batman?
Because I think they're going to like you.
[CLUCKS]
Huh?
Let's see. What do we have? Oh, good!
You like pie, Batman?
Because I think... Ah, forget it.
Ugh! Where does he get
these unbreakable toys?
Aah! Oh, come on!
Oh, see? Now you get out.
You were afraid of a real fight.
Yeah. You're so scary.
[SIRENS WAILING]
Watch the suit, boys!
- Thanks for helping out, Batman.
-Hey, you know, I also was a part of this.
- Hey, guys. Need a hand?
-With what? Parking?
ROBIN:
Huh?
Yeah, sorry, I wanted to be there
for your award.
- Uh, I mean, uh, Bruce Wayne's award.
-Me too.
- Kids weren't invited.
-Mm.
- So I saw you put a big hole in the theater.
BATMAN: I'll get it repaired.
I already did that.
Also, I put your boat back in the water.
- Hey, thanks.
BATMAN: Yeah, thanks.
You know, you should really try
not to make such a mess...
...while you're fighting crime.
I can see you smirking in there.
X-ray vision.
Aren't there people somewhere else
that need your help right now?
Yeah, actually, there are. I should go.
See you, guys.
- Bye, Superman. He's so nice.
BATMAN: Yeah, he's great.
- You were kind of rude.
-I was doing a systems check.
See you at the Batcave.
<i>Scenes of chaos tonight

Clark Kent. Really despise that guy.

Me. A hometown boy who made good.
LUTHOR:
You're right. You don't deserve that.
That's right, I don't. Eh--
Uh, wait, who said that?
LUTHOR: How would you like to be out
of Arkham right now...
...and given a chance to take revenge on
Batman and the rest of this ungrateful city?
Well, I'd have to be crazy
to say no to that offer.
Unless you're just one of the voices in
my head, in which case, I'm crazy anyway.
What?
Oh, hey, Lex.
Have you come to get your watch back...
...or did a bus from Metropolis
get lost and break down?
First, I don't take the bus.
And second, yes, give me my watch.
- So, what you got there?
-This, my friend, is the deconstructor.
It emits a unique energy...
...one that is absorbed so quickly
by any shiny black object...
...that it causes it to pull itself apart.
[GASPS]
Nifty. What's it got to do with me?
First, I need help replacing
its power source.
- It doesn't run on double-A batteries.
-Ha-ha-ha!
Kryptonite.
And second, I might need some of that
Joker gas you're so good at making.
Oh, yeah.
I guess that could come in handy
for someone running for president.
You help me, you can use the
deconstructor to your heart's content.
Know anybody who has lots of shiny black
unbreakable toys?
I don't know who you're referring to.
- Come on. Batman. Oh, you were...
-Joking. I'm the Joker.

-Well, I think I should do it.

Nah.
- Joker, could we move things along?
-You're no fun to shop with, Lexy.

Whoa! Hey!

Stop!
Okay, we can go.
On second thought, I have an idea.

-I'm an artiste!
I like to challenge myself

[TIRES SCREECH]
- Commissioner.
-Oh, thank goodness you're here.
No problem, Jim.
Commissioner Gordon

- What's the situation?
-There's been a breakout at Arkham.
The bridge automatically submerges
during a prison break.
Unfortunately, it's so old
it takes a long time to raise again.

- I'll get over there and start cleaning up.
-Batman, wait for me.

Holy baloney, totally scared Catwoman.
- Did you see that? Ha!

Oh, come on,

Now, Robin, what were you saying?
Something catty I believe?
- All right, everybody, back inside.
-Let's ask the coin.
Yeah, the coin says no. Ha, ha.

Not this time.

So we'll lose him in the sculpture garden.

Well, we contained the breakout.
All the prisoners are accounted for,
except the Joker.
ROBIN: He must have been
the first one to break out.
- Smuggled in some kind of explosive.
BATMAN: No, I don't think so.
There'd be blast marks,
powder burns, something.
- It's as if the bricks just flew out.
-Well, yeah, no.
I mean, you didn't let me finish.
I was gonna say...
Was gonna say smuggled
in some kind of explosive...
...which would be the usual way
he would break out...
...which he didn't because
there is no sign of an explosive.

I've heard that Lex Luthor

Those aren't the chemicals
he spilled all over the floor?
No.

I had the Batmobile tracking kryptonite.
It wouldn't have picked this up.
There must have been kryptonite
in the van.
What is the point of making kryptonite
that wouldn't harm Superman?
BATMAN: We'll put it away
with the other kryptonite just to be safe.

-Kryptonite.

What are they up to?
I don't know, but tomorrow is election day,

-Joker for president!
We love Joker!
[LAUGHS]
Oh, did I forget to mention
the gas just works for me?
Sorry, oversight.
You dirty double-crosser.
You tricked me.
I said, vice-president didn't work for me.
President Joker, now that sounds right.
The vice part goes without saying.
Now, get in, and I'll let you
be vice-president.
LUTHOR:
Oh, I'm such an idiot.
- They're going to take off.
-I've got some of my strength back.
- The kryptonite.
<i>-I'll</i> slow them down, Batman.
It'll be up to you to stop them.
[GRUNTS]
This time, Lex,
I'm going to pull Batman apart.
Literally.
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
[LAUGHS]
Huh?
Robin, great job.
- What?
-I think I'm going to cry.
Get going.
Whoa.
Take a left up here.
Take a hard right.
Now left.
- We're not losing them.
-I'm not trying to. Left again.
- Where have you been?
-Getting some help.
- Well, Batman, any last words?
-Yeah.
Look, you're on TV.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's also visible from space, you idiot.
Calling all Justice Leaguers.
<i>Calling all Justice Leaguers.</i>
Ha!
[GRUNTS]
<i>MANHUNTER:
Calling all Justice Leaguers.</i>
<i>Calling all Justice Leaguers.</i>
<i>Calling all Justice Leaguers.</i>
[ROARS]
- Unh.
-What do you want to do?
Well, I do despise Bruce Wayne.
[GROANING]
[SHRIEKS]
[GRUNTS]
- Thanks.
-Don't let go yet.
I wasn't going to.
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Why is a giant robot
climbing up Wayne Tower?
Giant robot? Let's get it.
Follow me.
I, uh, know my way around this place.
JOKER:
Come and get me.
[LAUGHING]
[ALL GRUNTING]
Huh?
JOKER:
Let me shake you by the hand.
FLASH:
Aah!
[JOKER LAUGHING]
Jump.
[GULPS]
[YELLING]
[JOKER LAUGHING]
Ooh, you're so strong.
Come on.
Go.
FLASH:
Phew.
- Thanks.
BATMAN: Huh?
[LAUGHING]
We have to stop them.
[LAUGHING]
[SIREN WAILING]
- Are you my mother?
-Yes.
Give us a hug.
[LAUGHING]
Ha, ha. That tickles.
[GRUNTS]
Gonna need a little help here.
Get the power source. It's in his chest.
[BOTH YELL]
Wonder Woman, need your plane.
[LAUGHS THEN POWERS DOWN]
- Agh!
-Huh?
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha.
Well, that was fun.
[BOTH GRUNT]
There is a little good news.
At least you're not going to be president.
[SIREN WAILING]
Great work, Batman.
I have to admit, I couldn't have done it
without a little help from my friends.
Uh, a little?
Well, Bruce Wayne said when he was given
the Man of the Year Award...
...that everybody needs help
now and again.
Well, he is a wise man.
[ENGINE STARTS]
- What did you do with all the kryptonite?
-I put it in a safe place.
We might need it one day
if Superman decides to go bad.
See? I'm not the only one.
You know, I can hear you.
So, Bats, you need a little help
rebuilding the Batcave?
- No, Robin and I--
-Yes, we'd like some help.
Say it with me.
Okay, we probably could use some.
Are--? Are you asking me?
Are you asking me to help you
rebuild the Batcave?
Well, no, I was asking Green Lantern.
I don't think this is your color.
[ALL LAUGHING]
SUPERMAN:
Jovial.
I have located it.
