Oh, come on.

[ Screaming ]
Help!

[ Screaming ]
[ Thud ]

Atta boy.
Get' em down.
All right, come on,

There's nothin'

- [ Sighs ] Too bad.
- Uh-huh.
- Guess you'll be needin'
a new topper now?
- Right.
- Well?
- Well what?
- Well, how 'bout me?
- It's widow's work.
I ain't married.
- What are you trying to pull, Gann?
-Just gimme the damn job.
Okay, wise guy.
It's yours.
Hey, Gann!
It won't bring her back.
[ Men Chattering ]
Yeah? I'm gonna
cut your nose off!.
Come on! Get it movin'!
Let's go!
[ Man ] Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doin'?
That's mine.
I know you.
You helped me... in Chicago.
Nice way of payin' me back.
[ Men Chattering ]
I wouldn't try it. Steal their food,
and they're gonna eat you up.
Got a spoon?
Go on.
What do I have to
do for it?
just eat the damn beans, kid.
[ Men Chattering ]
[ Wolf Growling ]
Uh-oh.
- [ Growling ]
- Where'd ya go?
- Is that a friend of yours?
- We're travelin' together.
-It's hard enough without packin' a dog.
-He's a wolf.
That's even better.
- We can take care of ourselves.
- Yeah, I bet.
- That ain't dog food.
- Oh, yeah?
Look, I go alone.
I don't take no partners.
- Especially not a girl.
- Well, nobody asked ya.
- Good, don't.
- I won't.
[ Low Growl ]
[ Growling ]
- Somethin' ain't right.
- What?
-[ Growls ]
- Something's wrong. He always knows.
[ Truck Approaching ]
[ Men Yelling ]
- Let's beat it, kid!
- [ Men Shouting ]
[ Screaming ]
Who are those guys?
Main Streeters.
Good law-abidin' citizens.
- [ Groans ]
- They don't like the way we live.
- You comin'?
- But I thought--
Make up your mind, kid.
[ Men Continue Yelling ]
[ Chopping ]
[ Grunting ]
Comin'down!
[ Crash ]
[ Sighs ]
She's comin'.
Ah, it's gonna be a good one, kid.
That's a through freight.
[ Whistle Blowing ]
It's the right train.
The right speed.
- Perfect.
- [ Animal Howls ]
What are ya doin'?
- Hey, come on, kid, get set.
- [ Growls ]
Come back!
Come back here!
Hey! Come on, now!
You can't wait for him. Let's go!
[ Whistle Blows ]
- We gotta wait for him!
- Forget it. That was
a she-wolf callin'. He's gone.
- He wouldn't do that!
- Get on!
- He's gonna come, I know it.
- Gimme your hand, damn it!
Swing.
There he is! Look!
Come on! Run!
- Mm-mm.
- Faster!
- Come on! Come on!
- He ain't gonna make it.
He's never gonna make it.
Come on!
-Jump!
- Never make it!
- He won't make it.
-Jump!
- He made it.
- [ Playful Growl ]
[ Train Bell Ringing ]
[ Brakes Screeching ]
-[ Man ] Hey, get outta there!
- What is it? Shh.
Come on.
Out, out, out.
Come on.
-[ Banging ]
- Come on.
[ Whispering ]
Get down.
Come here! Hey, Tom!
- What was that?
- Look in here.
I think I heard something.
[ Growling ]
- [ Whimpers ]
- Ha! It's a damn dog.
Let's go.
- Are they gone?
- What?
Are they gone?
Yeah.
[ Gulps ]
Come on, kid.
Quit slowin' me down.
Yeah.
I'm hungry.
- You got no business
bein' on the road, kid.
- As much as you've got.
Sure.
Aw, they won't refuse a kid. Here.
Stick your thumb up, be cute, smile.
- That was a swell idea.
- Thanks. Keep walkin'.
- Ya know, it's snowin'.
- Really?
Really.
- I'm cold.
- Buck up, kid, will ya?
I'm buckin'!
I'm buckin', right?
Hey!
I tell you, this is great.
We got the mountains, we got the lakes.
Lakes? This is nothin'. We've got a lake
five times this size in Chicago.
And the weather, the wind is so strong,
my dad can lean like this
and not fall over.
- That's weather.
- In Chicago, really?
- Yeah.
- I passed through Chicago once.
I didn't see much.
- A lot of lights.
- You ain't seen Chicago,
you ain't seen nothin'.
You're a real woman of the world, kid.
[ Laughs ]
It looks safe. Come on.
Come on! It's empty!
Nothin' in here but a pig,
and he sure don't care.
- Harry?
- Huh?
- You awake?
- No, kid, I'm talkin' in my sleep.
Harry,
what are you gonna do
when we get there, to Seattle?
I'm gonna look for work.
Have you ever been there,
to the coast?
Four years ago.
Frisco.
Me and my old man.
Your dad?
We was outside this refinery
lookin' for work.
Hundreds of us guys.
And this foreman comes out with
Pinkerton cops on each side and he says,
""I need two guys for the bull gang
and I need two guys for the hole.''
He had four jobs.
Four lousy jobs.
And everybody started
pushin' and shovin'.
And my old man,
he got knocked down.
There was so many guys
I couldn't get to him.
[ Sighs ]
He never got up.
I'm sorry, Harry.
Me too.
[ Banging ]
-[ Woman ] I'll check the barn.
Maybe I left 'em in there.
- Come on!
[ Train Whistle Blows ]
- What are we doin'?
- We gotta go up.
Stay close.
Keep comin'.
[ Whistle Blowing ]
Be careful.
[ Whistle Blows ]
All right, Natty.
Now walk down the arm very slowly!
- The arm?
- Right. Come on. One step at a time.
You can do it.
Let go of that wire.
Eyes straight ahead.
Don't look down!
No, no, let go of that.
No, no, don't hold that wire!
Aw, shit!
[ Choking ]
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Screams ]
- Come on.
- Come on!Jump!
Come on. Go, now!
[ Both Cheering ]
[ Harry ]
All right!
All right!
Yeah!
[ Man ]
You got yourself a job.
Good luck, kid.
- Thank you.
- Next!
Name?
Harry.
Harry, look at this?
- What're ya starin' at?
- Nothin'.
- Then look at this.
It's a W.P.A. Project. A lumber camp.
- Listen.
I got us a ride over
to the mill and everything.
- The mill?
- Don't you get it?
My dad's probably up there.
- So what?
- Hmm?
So what?
What if he is?
- I don't understand
what you're talkin' about.
- He ran out on you, Natty.
No!
No, he didn't.
You're wrong.
Am I?
Listen, Natty.
I got work.
- That's great.
- In California. I leave today.
I want you to come with.
You and me, we'll go together.
We'll go in style. We'll take the bus.
What do ya think?
Well, it's no skin off of my back
either way. I just thought--
I gotta find him first...
before I can do anything.
I just can't go
with you now.
Understand?
Yeah, sure.
[ P.A. Announcer Speaking ]
- I guess you better get on.
- Yeah.
- Don't want 'em to leave without you.
- Don't want that.
- I guess it's really good-bye, huh?
- Yeah, I guess it is.
Well, uh... bye.
Bye.
Here you go.
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- Yeah.
Harry?
[ Men Chattering,
Machines Running ]
- [ Laughing ]
-Are we taking off?.
Shipping 'em out today.
Hey, Charlie, wait up!
- Yeah, what do you want?
- I'm lookin' for someone. My dad.
- He's at the mill?
- I think so. Sol Gann.
[ Sighs ]
- G-A-N-N?
- Yeah.
- There's no Gann. [ Closes Drawer ]
- He's gotta be here!
They move a lot of guys through here.
It's almost impossible to keep track.
Half the time we don't know who's here,
who's at base camp, who's anywhere.
- Base camp? What's that?
- Forget it, kid. You can't go up there.
- But I gotta find him!
-Sorry, there's nothin'
I can do for you.
What's that animal doing here?
Is he yours?
Get him outta here!
You too! Get!
[ Men Chattering ]
All right, listen up, men!
- When we gettin' outta here?
- We're finished on the mountain, right?
- Can't keep the ladies
waitin' much longer.
- [ Laughing ]
They're sending
a few of us back up.
Ah, hell, they can't do that.
We've just come down.
What about Alaska?
When do we go?
- That's a good question.
- [ Laughing ]
- One more job, and then we're
outta here for good, men.
- [ Men Sighing ]
Now, I don't blame ya.
Now, it's gonna be tricky.
Double wages for the lead men.
Any volunteers?
How come I always have to drive
this damn thing up the mountain?
Right in there. All the way in.
Easy, easy, now, easy.
Nice and easy.
That's it.
[ Engine Starts ]
All right, take it up!
You got everything?
- Do you know this man? It's my father.
- Nope.
- Do you know this man?
- Uh-uh.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm lookin'--
This country's for him,
not for a girl. You're goin'
back down first truck I line up.
[ Thinking ] ""Dear Harry.
I'm okay, I guess. So's the wolf.
[ Whimpers ]
""I haven't found him yet.
- I miss you.''
-[ Wolf Pacing ]
[ Whining ]
Love. No.
Sincerely--
Oh, shit.
Natty.
just plain Natty.
[ Whining ]
[ Animal Howling ]
[ Whining ]
[ Growling ]
Hey!
Wait! Stop!
[ Animal Howling ]
[ Howling Continues ]
Go on.
There's where you belong.
Go!
Go.
Hey,you in there?
I think I might have found him. Don't
get your hopes up, but is this you?
It was in
with the dead letters.
[ Sol's Voice ] Dear Natty. Leavin'
was the hardest thing I've ever done.
It tears at my guts
to think I've let you down.
I hope you can forgive me.
I love you.
Come right away.
Dad.
- Where is he?
- With ""D'' group,
if they're still up there?
- Where?
- At the top. Got you a ride up.
Hey, mister. Can't this thing
go any faster? Come on!
- Can you fix it?
- I don't know.
I think the axle's busted.
Thanks anyway, mister.
[ Boss ]
Oh, my God!
[ Explosions Continue ]
Get 'em down! Get 'em down, now!
Come on, move!
[ Panting ]
- Got him.
- All right, get 'em down!
Let's get 'em down!
Dad! Dad!
Slow up!
Dad!
[ Crying ]
No!
No!
[ Sobbing ]
[ Sol ]
Natty?
[ Laughs ]
