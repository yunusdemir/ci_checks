The Silence of the Sky
Quiet! Stay quiet!
Quiet!
Mario?
It's me.
Are you busy?
Oh yeah?
Can you go pick up the kids then?
They have tennis class.
You need to go now.
Yes, I'm fine.
Did something happen?
Well, go now.
Mami, we're home!
I'm gonna play here.
To the cactus!
I wanna see the Crawling Devil!
- You're a copycat!
- No I'm not!
Hello.
We want to see if it moves!
- What?
- We want to see if it moves, dad.
It's a Crawling Devil.
It's the only plant in the world
that's able to move.
- Is it? Who told you that?
- Mom.
Don't do this sweetheart. Eat it.
Finished! Can I go watch the race?
What race?
Downhill skiing, mom.
When I grow up I'm gonna beat
the record for speed.
Me, the time record.
What a copycat! You wanted to be a
parachutist. Not a skier.
Nina, I'm gonna be both things.
You cannot be both.
Ten minutes, then shower.
I'm finished too!
- No, you are not.
- It's starting, Julián!
Please, mom!
Take your plate and don't leave
anything uneaten.
Julián!
I'll clean it later!
What?
My blood pressure dropped.
I get dizzy easily, remember?
- Should I call a doctor?
- No.
There's no need. I'm tired. that's all.
I can call Dr. Risso.
No.
I just need to lie down.
Rain is coming.
The sheets are hanging outside...
Don't worry. I'll get them if it
starts to rain.
Would you put them to sleep?
<i>I don't know when exactly
I started feeling scared.</i>
<i>My mother often talks about how
hard it was to put me to sleep,- </i>
<i>- during my whole childhood.</i>
<i>I struggled a lot not to fall asleep.</i>
<i>I’d freak out.</i>
<i>She thinks I was afraid of
not waking up.</i>
<i>But I don't know if that’s what
it was. I can't remember.</i>
<i>What my mother never knew is that,
afterwards, sleeping became even harder.</i>
<i>I didn't tell her of all the nights
I spent paralyzed in bed, -</i>
<i>- unable to close my eyes.</i>
<i>Unable to get up.</i>
<i>Paralyzed.</i>
<i>Slowly learning to think it was ok
to live with fear the whole time.</i>
<i>Quiet.</i>
<i>Shut up.</i>
Stay quiet.
I'll cut your throat.
Shut your mouth.
Be quiet! Be quiet!
Shut up!
Come here!
Here!
Shut up. Shut up.
Stay quiet!
Hello? Hello?
<i>Mario? It's me.</i>
How are you?
<i>Are you busy?</i>
No, I'm not busy, my love.
The meeting's over.
The directors didn't come. It's done.
<i>Can you go pick up the kids then?</i>
Yeah, I can pick them up.
I'll take a cab and go.
But I'm near home...
Maybe I can come by.
I'll still have time to get there.
<i>- Are you ok?
- Yes, I'm fine.</i>
<i>- Did something happen?
- No, no.</i>
No, it's... Because... I ran.
<i>Well, go now.</i>
Ok, I'll go.
Teamwork!
A strong one daddy!
Mami, we're home!
I'm gonna play here.
To the cactus!
I wanna see the Crawling Devil!
- You're a copycat!
- No I'm not!
Diana?
Hello.
We want to see if it moves!
- What?
- We want to see if it moves, dad.
It's a Crawling Devil.
It's the only plant in the world
that's able to move.
-Is it? Who told you that?
-Mom.
Ouch.
What happened?
Nothing...
I...
I hurt myself with the cactus.
Let me see it.
You still have a couple of thorns there.
After dinner I'll get them out.
Clumsy as usual.
More.
Tired?
Yes.
A little bit.
You?
Fine.
How did it go?
Everything ok in the club?
What?
Did everything go well
with the kids at the club?
Yeah.
Everything fine.
Now the band-aid...
Which one did you pick?
This one.
Daddy...
What does "to retreat" mean?
"To retreat" means to move back.
"To advance" is to go forward...
And "to retreat" is to go back.
Done.
Good. Come on.
Lights off...
Bye.
<i>Diana always knew about my fears.</i>
<i>On our first date I said,
pretending it was a joke, -</i>
<i>- that I had all the phobias
in the world.</i>
<i>She laughed, took a napkin
and started a list.</i>
<i>"Mario's Fear List."</i>
<i>Death. Confinement.</i>
<i>Speed. Height. Airplanes...</i>
<i>Perhaps the airplanes above all else, -</i>
<i>- since they combine almost half
of my fears in one single thing,- </i>
<i>I remember telling her.</i>
<i>She still lived in Brazil
at that time,- </i>
<i>- so I told her about the fear of distance.</i>
<i>We kissed.</i>
<i>We dated for six months.</i>
<i>We lived together for eight years.
Had two children.</i>
<i>Then we were separated for two years,
one month and seventeen days.</i>
<i>One week ago I came back home
to stay.</i>
<i>All of this time I knew she kept
writing down my phobias...</i>
<i>On that list she kept with care.</i>
<i>I know there's no room left
on that napkin.</i>
<i>No more fear will fit in it.</i>
It was high, so very high.
Very high?
Like what?
- High as the moon.
- Wow!
And I was falling...
And it took a long time to fall.
Did you ever dream something like that?
Yes. But...
A second before crashing to the
ground...
I woke up.
What's that sport called?
When they tie you to a rope...
And you jump into the void?
Bungee jumping, Julián.
That's what I want to do!
- Good morning.
- Hi.
Morning.
It's dangerous. You're too small.
Daddy, when I'm big. When I'm ten.
Are you ok?
I feel like I've got beaten up.
I don't know. Maybe it's the flu.
I phoned Elisa. I'm not going to
the atelier today.
I've also got the flu.
Can I stay home too?
- Me too.
- No, you're very well.
I've got Nina's fever.
How did we make such little monsters?
What monsters? Take that!
Good! Are you done?
Go get your backpack,
the bus is almost here.
You made us because you were in love.
We still are, Nina.
True.
The house changes a lot when
the kids leave.
We can even talk.
Do you want me to stay in today?
I can write from here...
Take care of you.
Don't you have to vacate your
apartment today?
I can go later.
At the end of the day.
You don't have to, Mario.
Go.
Are you sure?
<i>Totally sure.</i>
<i>Go pick your stuff up.</i>
<i>Fear of death. Confinement. Speed.</i>
<i>Fear of heights. Airplanes.
Distance. Madness.</i>
<i>Fear of amputations.
Fear of ships. Fear of the sea.</i>
<i>Fear of sharks. Alligators
Snakes. Unknown dogs.</i>
<i>Of guns. Dentists. Misery. Poverty.</i>
<i>Football stadiums. Insects.
Crowds. Violence. Elevators.</i>
<i>Diseases. Doctors. Thunderstorms.
Electricity.</i>
<i>Pressure cookers. Gas tanks.
Big cities,</i>.
<i>Empty streets. Blood. Cancer.
The police.</i>
<i>Scorpions. Aging.</i>
I'm down here. Do I come up?
<i>Fear of being impotent.</i>
<i>Fear I’ll stop being loved.</i>
<i>Fear of being ridiculed in public.</i>
<i>Fear of not being right.</i>
<i>Fear of being cheated.</i>
<i>Fear of being overlooked.</i>
<i>Fear of looking frail.</i>
<i>Fear of knowing the truth.</i>
<i>Fear of not knowing the truth.</i>
<i>Do you know this woman?</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>No. It's fiction.</i>
<i>I work on TV. I'm a writer.</i>
<i>Ana is the name of the character.</i>
<i>And in this screenplay...</i>
The friend of the woman saw everything...
But didn't intervene?
No.
He couldn't.
He...
Had fear.
Fear for her life. It was
a delicate situation.
They were armed.
They were strong. Big. Young men.
His own life was also at risk.
So, what I want to know...
Is...
Why?
Why would a woman that was raped...
Not say a...
A word about it at all?
Here you'll find the information
you need for your script.
I suggest your character reports
the crime at a police station.
The first hours are critical.
Neither the woman nor her belongings...
Should be cleaned or washed before
they're properly examined.
<i>What's going on?</i>
What's this about?
- I changed the locks.
- Why?
There were a couple of robberies
around last week.
I didn't tell so you wouldn't worry.
Come in.
Trini is in your office.
- Trini?
- Yes.
<i>Mario. Mario. Wake up!</i>
<i>We have one week to air.</i>
<i>Wake up or we'll get fired.</i>
Pablo will fire us. For real.
I'm telling you.
Ok.
Where were we?
We're stuck with Alicia in the kitchen.
She's desperate, waiting
for his arrival...
<i>The same way I learned
to live with constant fear,- </i>
<i>- I also learned how to hide it.</i>
<i>I talk. Work on my scripts.</i>
<i>Show my intelligence.
My kind nature.</i>
<i>Reprehend other people’s hypocrisy.</i>
<i>I smile with the sincere appearance
of a guy who sees his own fear as a joke.</i>
<i>Almost everybody buys it.
Including myself.</i>
<i>For a long time I thought
I had mastered this disguise...</i>
<i>To a level where there wasn’t
any trace left of it on my face, - </i>
<i>- my gestures, my voice.</i>
<i>Until I met Diana and her lucidity.</i>
<i>Her eyes disarmed me.</i>
<i>She learned fast how to
bring my mask down, -</i>
<i>- to notice every little flaw
in my perfect imitation of myself.</i>
The ring won't fit because...
No ring fits the same finger
for a whole life.
You see? Because... The finger changes.
What the hell is he talking about?
Now for the last whisky.
Gotta save my body for tomorrow's party.
- Enjoy it for me.
- What? Won't you come?
Diana, he has to be there tomorrow.
All the producers will come.
He's a grown man, Trini.
He can do what he wants.
A grown man?!
You two have restored your love nest
and now no one leaves the house.
What will happen  when you go to Spain?
Spain?
- Shit. I fucked up.
- No, you didn't.
What is it, Mario?
I meant to tell you yesterday, but...
I was offered a job in Spain.
It's a film script.
- That's great.
- Yes, it's quite nice.
But I won't travel. I've decided.
I just got back home. You see?
Can't leave you and the kids alone.
Is it the airplane?
Are you still scared?
Yes.
It got worse.
It's very hard.
The very idea of knowing
I'll board an airplane...
You know?
I'm paralyzed.
Besides, it's not just going.
I also have to come back.
Mario, airplanes are the safest
method of traveling.
What are you talking about?
I know it's the safest.
It's not about the statistics.
It's not something I can control...
I had a horrible dream.
What dream?
Diana?
I woke up early.
Couldn't sleep.
<i>This is where I want to be.</i>
<i>Here. With you so close to me.</i>
<i>Until the final flicker of life's amber.</i>
<i>I, who was lost and lonely, believing...</i>
<i>Rainy season about to end in
Montevideo. Temperature going down to...</i>
- Mario, how are you?!
- How are you?
What a surprise. Such a long time.
I'm so happy with all you guys
are going through.
Me too.
Good.
Should I prepare some mate tea?
No, don't bother. I have to go.
But first you must tell me:
Do you like our ideas for the new collection?
- Nobody showed it to me.
- Oh, please.
Come, come look. This one for instance.
Let's see if you like it.
I love it. Seriously.
- You like it?
- Yes.
Your wife's idea.
We're still a bit unsure about
the cactus thing.
Many people hate cactus
cause they think all of them are harmful.
But for us, they are fantastic.
The texture, the volume.
For fashion...
- They have their charm.
- Right...
Speaking of charm, Diana told me
about your trip to Spain.
When did you tell her?
Yesterday. I told her because her
brother was frightened of airplanes.
Yes, it was terrible.
He was petrified.
Yeah, but anyway...
I'm not sure I'll go.
That's why I mentioned it,
because he's cured!
He had a few sessions with a
specialized psychologist.
And besides therapy, there was also
an amazing flight simulator.
Which my brother just sent to me...
So, well, I wanted to show it if you
don't mind... It's just two minutes.
It's really cool.
Here we go.
It's well done.
Very real.
Too strong for me, can't watch this.
I'm going to give you his number.
His name is Dr. Comas.
I'll get it right away.
- Is his name really Dr. Comas?
- Yes. But seriously...
You should try it.
- Well.
- Here it is.
Thank you, Elisa. Thank you so much.
Welcome!
<i>Diana’s talent to notice
the panic I tried to hide...</i>
<i>Made me happy in the beginning.</i>
<i>It was as if someone was finally
seeing through me.</i>
<i>But then I began feeling
too fragile compared to her.</i>
<i>That seemingly understanding look...</i>
<i>Confronted me all the time.</i>
<i>It was exhausting.</i>
<i>I needed to balance our forces.</i>
<i>I started using the rhetoric of sincerity
I had stolen from her. To undermine her.</i>
<i>I required, some time after we married, -</i>
<i>- that she told me all of her feelings.</i>
<i>I demanded from Diana all of her flaws,
in order to fuel my confidence.</i>
Hey Trini.
I'm home. Listen to me.
I'll have to stay here for a while, ok?
<i>What do you mean?!
We have work to do.</i>
I know you're waiting for me,
but Diana asked me to...
<i>Mario, we need to finish.
They're pressuring me.</i>
Give me...
<i>- Give me...
- You must come now.</i>
Ok, ok, ok. Gimme a couple of hours.
I'll call you in a minute, ok?
Bye.
<i>I pretty much forced her to talk.</i>
<i>I strongly insisted, demanded,
wanted her to describe everything:</i>
<i>An unexpected desire for
someone other than me.</i>
<i>A hidden cry in the bathroom.</i>
<i>The anguish of wanting to quit
everything for a moment.</i>
<i>A moment of rage towards our
children.</i>
<i>The urge to scream violently
in the middle of a fight with me.</i>
<i>To kill me. To choke me while
I slept.</i>
<i>To hurt me. To make me suffer.</i>
<i>The impulse to break the windows
of the room. Or punch the walls.</i>
<i>Or run the car against a lamppost
at full speed.</i>
<i>Or stick her own hand in boiling
water.</i>
<i>Everything she said sounded
like an attack to me.</i>
<i>To expose my weakness.</i>
<i>My brutality. My insecurity.
My lack of love.</i>
<i>My coldness. My selfishness.
My violence.</i>
<i>Then something broke.</i>
<i>She lost her curiosity about me.</i>
<i>She wanted us to break up.
I accepted, pretending to be relieved.</i>
<i>But there wasn’t a single day
we spent apart when I didn’t miss...</i>
<i>The life we had built together.</i>
<i>After a while, I asked her if
she wanted to give it another try.</i>
<i>She was very reluctant.</i>
<i>But gradually I realized that,
without the intensity of the early years, -</i>
<i>- we felt much more comfortable
in our roles.</i>
<i>I think that's why we managed
to get back together.</i>
<i>Reassured that everything
would work out fine- </i>
<i>- if we acted like the characters
we had created.</i>
<i>Do you like them?</i>
Yes.
That's a very special cactus.
The Crawling Devil.
Oh, you know the variety.
It's one of the strangest cacti
in the world.
They don't grow here.
My son brought it in from
the beaches of Baja California.
It's also the only cactus in the arid part
of Mexico that doesn't grow erect.
Is it true that they can move?
Five centimeters a year, yes.
Were you looking for anything
in particular?
No, I...
I'll take this one.
- The smaller one.
- A nice choice.
Is it a gift?
Yes.
Does your son make home deliveries?
What?
Do you make home deliveries?
Oh yes, whenever necessary.
- How much do I owe you?
- UYU$250.
And thank you for choosing the
Belvedere Nursery Garden.
Mario?
<i>The problem is, that I found out too late
that these characters we invented- </i>
<i>- wouldn’t fit all situations.</i>
<i>They can’t handle whatever
escapes routine.</i>
<i>And I, -</i>
<i>- after all my effort to make her
stop seeing me so clearly,- </i>
<i>- have been trying at all costs,
these last days, to make her retreat...</i>
<i>And forget for a moment the
opaque character- </i>
<i>- that I helped her build.</i>
Hi.
Mario, you scared me.
Sorry.
That's ok. Where are the kids?
At my parents.
I asked them if the kids could spend
the night so...
We could have some peace.
It's been a long time since
our last dinner alone.
You just moved back a week ago.
Exactly.
Exactly...
This weekend they are heading
to the coast. To Punta del Este.
They offered to take the kids.
Good.
- Did you cook?
- Yes, chicken and potatoes.
Do I have time to shower?
You have fifteen, twenty minutes.
What about this?
It's a gift for you.
It looked nice...
For the work
you're doing. No?
I was thinking of giving them all away.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What happened to you could happen
to the kids.
Cheers.
Had a nice shower?
Yes.
Do you know where I've been today?
No.
No?
Guess.
My first appointment with Dr. Comas.
Really?!
Did you like it?
Yes. Very much.
Did you enter the flight simulator?
Yes.
I can't complete this collection.
Maybe the problem is me.
No, Mario.
You can't concentrate
since I came back.
No. Nothing to do with that.
I'm the one causing it.
No.
You're not.
What is it then?
I don't know.
Tell me.
Tell me.
It's nothing, Mario. Don't worry.
<i>If my efforts don’t pay off, -</i>
<i>- if I can no longer convince
Diana to trust me and talk, -</i>
<i>- then I too must be the confident c
haracter I’ve created.</i>
<i>To maintain this confidence,
I needed help.</i>
<i>So I went to Trini’s that same night
and asked to borrow his gun.</i>
<i>I told him that Dr. Comas wanted
to make an exercise with an unloaded gun -</i>
<i>- to help me overcome my fear.</i>
<i>Trini laughed. But he gave me
his father’s gun and said:</i>
<i>"It still works.</i>
<i>Be careful."</i>
Good morning.
Back again?
Yes.
Any problem with the cactus?
No. My girlfriend...
She saw the cactus last night...
And said she doesn't want it home
'cause it brings bad luck.
- That is absurd.
- Yes.
They bring good fortune.
Yes.
So I'd like another plant.
That doesn't demand too much,
but a real one. And not a cactus.
We don't work with plastic plants.
If I told that to my son...
He's the one who's fanatic for
the plants.
It is the only thing that matters
to him.
He can help you better than I.
Néstor. Come here, son.
Help this man choose a plant for a gift.
But don't forget you have a delivery
to make.
This one is called Poinsettia.
Very beautiful. It's red.
It's a pretty gift.
If it doesn't get much light it turns green.
Like this one.
What would you give your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend.
The Orchid is always a good gift.
But it's not an easy one.
Take a look at the flower.
See how beautiful it is.
Do you always make the deliveries
alone?
Anthurium! This one.
I have lots of this one.
Do you live in a house or an apartment?
Apartment.
What other plants do you have there?
None.
But you just said that...
Mother doesn't want plants at home.
I have my plants at my brother's house.
And at the agency.
Does your brother work here too?
In the agency, I told you.
Advertising.
He does advertising.
And? Did you decide?
Yes.
An Areca.
A big one.
But I'll come back later to get it.
It's out of stock.
Before 7:30 I'll come by.
Your son convinced me.
He told me your other son has many
of these in the agency.
Yes. Nestór gives a lot of plants
to his brother.
What's the name?
What's the name of the agency?
I might know it.
I also work in advertising.
Notorio.
Notorio.
It's renowned.
Very well-known.
Well.
See you later?
Excuse me.
What's your name?
I'll write your order down.
Comas.
Daniel Comas.
I'm Malena. If you need anything.
See you soon.
Hey girl.
Wow.
You're here early.
We left earlier.
Mario had an appointment with Dr. Comas.
The second one already.
- You're kidding.
- I'm not.
Are you feeling better?
Had a rough night.
I've been having nightmares.
Couldn't sleep well.
Poor thing. I'll get you coffee.
I don't want coffee, Elisa.
Thank you.
You're really not telling me what's
going on.
What do you mean?
If you don't say something right now
I'll start thinking it's really bad.
"Something."
Is he after you again?
No, he's not.
Stop talking about this.
It's over.
Do you remember that book
I told you about?
I found it.
It's perfect to open the runway show.
Let me find that part...
Here. Look.
It's a dialogue between a stork
and a hedgehog.
I even thought Julián and Nina
could read it.
You'll see it's deeply connected
to our subject.
- I don't want to read.
- Please!
If you don't like it. We won't use it.
Now come on.
I'll read the stork lines.
"For a long time I have loved you.
I'll say nothing about that.
I don't talk to creatures that love me.
Love is something so reckless, impudent!
I'll have no dealings with spendthrifts.
Make note of that.
It's my spines you're in love with,
isn't it?
Your mantle of spines suits you
charmingly.
You're adorable in it.
A pity you're so prudish.
What use to me is your affection?
Are you in love with my fear?
Yes.
Yes, I think so...
It suits me fine, don't you think?
I'm so nice and round in my fear.
I have spines because I'm afraid.
I'm all flight and fear."
What's that for?
What do you mean, what for? It's...
So we can think about what we're doing.
It's awful.
Goodness, calm down!
Calm down.
Hello.
<i>Mario. Can you come and get me?</i>
What's wrong?
<i>I'm not feeling so well.</i>
I'm nearby, I can take you to the doctor.
<i>...To Dr. Risso.
How near are you?</i>
About 10 minutes.
<i>So, can you come?</i>
I'll pick you up and then we go
for the kids.
Dad.
I like boys-only outings.
What?
Boys-only, like ours.
Don't you like it?
I like them too.
We have to do this more often.
Which day?
On Wednesdays and Fridays.
Because on Mondays and Tuesdays
I have physical education...
And on Thursdays I have Basketball.
So it could be Wednesdays and Fridays.
Great.
Fridays for me are good.
Can I borrow your
phone to play?
No.
But daddy, I have daily bonus at
Dragon Zombie!
- We're having a good time.
- Please...
- We're just boys talking.
- But please...
Come on. Please.
- Here.
- Cool!
Just a little while.
Ok.
That's uncle Andrés.
Who's uncle Andrés?
Do you know him?
Sure.
Sure?
Where from?
From home...
And his house.
From home?
Our home?
Can I have...?
Julián, please.
Listen to me.
Have you been in this man's house?
The house by the harbor.
The harbor?
The one with many floors.
We went there once.
He played with me.
It was fun.
What did you play?
Julián, what did you play?
The Play.
He had a great tennis game.
Can I get the phone?
Yes.
He's a friend of mom's, is that it?
Mom said he's no longer our friend.
That if we saw him,
we shouldn't speak to him.
- Are you coming?
- No, I'm going to work with Trini...
<i>My character would do something.</i>
<i>He wouldn’t be paralyzed by fear.</i>
<i>I created him this way. I spent
years developing his features.</i>
<i>I killed the curiosity in Diana’s eyes
so that he could exist without her suspicion.</i>
<i>I spent nights alone learning not to cry.
Or shake, or wish I was dead.</i>
<i>The character would have to do something.</i>
<i>I wouldn’t allow him to disappoint me.</i>
<i>Not after giving him my whole life.</i>
Mr. Comas. I have your Areca.
Wait a minute please.
Well, this is it.
- Great.
- We have to kill it.
I'll get the options.
Any of these will do.
The only difference between
the two is the concentration.
- Do you have children at home?
- Two girls.
So keep this out of their reach
because it's quite toxic.
This one is cheaper
but the result may vary.
It's just a plant anyway.
How much is it?
- UYU$100.
- Here.
Thank you for choosing the
Belvedere Nursery Garden.
Thank you, madam. See you soon.
Just wait there.
I'm gonna get it ready.
- It's a gift, right?
- Yes, please.
You know, I remembered who your
son is.
You did?
Yes, I know him. We worked together.
Andrés, right?
Yes, Andrés.
I know him.
I even went to a party at his house.
Andrés loves parties.
I just hate them.
The street was...
That one...
Close to the harbor.
What's the name of the street?
Néstor!
Come and put the Areca in the
gentleman's car.
Which car is it?
The black one over there.
Thank you.
It's open.
Also at the agency...
We did a lot of jobs together.
With such a plant you'll need
to take some potting soil.
Two large bags, at least.
One Areca...
Two bags...
- How much do I owe you?
- UYU$1200.
Don't you have smaller bills?
No. Sorry.
Wait a minute. I'll get you some change.
Néstor. Get the man two large bags
of potting soil.
Let's hope your girlfriend doesn't
talk nonsense now.
Let me do it.
OPEN
- Ok, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
What's going on, Néstor?
Are you ok? What's going on?
<i>Are you coming? The kids are hungry.</i>
Mom, why can't I
bring three bikinis?
Because it's just for two days, my love.
When are we going to Brazil
to visit our other grandparents?
I don't know. I hope soon.
But now what you must do is finish
packing and go to bed.
One, two, three.
The one who speaks first, loses.
<i>And now, -</i>
<i>- from this night on, -</i>
<i>- I am, in fact,- </i>
<i>- this man I invented.</i>
<i>This character I created.</i>
<i>I am, -</i>
<i>- in fact, -</i>
Mario?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm...
Thinking.
<i>This is where I want to be.</i>
<i>Here. With you so close to me.</i>
<i>Until the final flicker of
life's amber.</i>
<i>I, who was lost and lonely.</i>
<i>Believing life was only...</i>
<i>A bitter tragic joke.
Have found with you -</i>
<i>- the meaning of existence.</i>
<i>Oh my love.</i>
<i>Four days ago I started having
nightmares as soon as I fall asleep.</i>
<i>Today, for the first time, I didn’t
wake up too much during the night.</i>
<i>I must have managed to sleep
at least four straight hours.</i>
<i>Maybe it's because I went to the doctor.
Told him about my dizziness.</i>
<i>And took what he prescribed me to sleep.</i>
<i>I wanted to look alright when
I said goodbye to the kids.</i>
<i>But while I slept I had an
ongoing nightmare.</i>
<i>This one was different from the others.</i>
<i>I was alone. And I felt suffocated.</i>
<i>That was all.</i>
<i>I struggled, tried to breathe, but couldn’t.</i>
<i>I was breathless. My whole body
twisting.</i>
<i>The whole bedroom was a vacuum.</i>
<i>Maybe it’s better to stay awake.</i>
My son is taking these lessons to
lose his fear of flying very seriously.
I've never seen him do anything
on a Saturday morning before.
It's an intensive course.
Just for a few days.
Are you sure everything's ok?
Yes.
This opportunity you're giving
yourselves...
Make it count.
He loves you.
Alright...
Enough interrogation.
Let's get going.
If you need anything, call us.
Anytime.
Ok.
And if you decide to come tomorrow...
We'll wait for you with meat
on the grill.
Sweethearts. Listen to your
grandparents, ok?
Sure!
I love you.
We love you too.
<i>Hi, this is Mario's number,
leave your message. Bye.</i>
Hey Trini. What's wrong?
<i>Diana, how you doing?
Sorry to bother you.</i>
Did you two fight?
<i>No! How are we going to fight if
he won't even answer my calls?</i>
<i>I call and call and he
ignores me. I'm desperate.</i>
<i>Forgive me for involving you,
but Pablo just called me.</i>
<i>If we don't have the whole
script by tomorrow, we're out.</i>
<i>This is very serious.</i>
<i>Please, put him on.</i>
He's not here.
<i>Wasn't he with you yesterday?</i>
<i>No. I haven't seen him since he
came here to borrow my gun.</i>
<i>For that therapy,
the fear of flight stuff.</i>
<i>- It's been two days and...
- I have to go, Trini.</i>
<i>In my dreams I also see weapons.</i>
<i>Not only the knife,</i>
<i>But iron rods. Heavy wooden bats.</i>
<i>A gun pressed against my chest.</i>
<i>What Trini said made me think
about them.</i>
<i>It also made me think Mario has
always been afraid of guns.</i>
<i>I know he'd never grab one and
bring it home for the sake of a simulation.</i>
<i>There had to be a stronger reason.</i>
<i>Hi. This is Mario's number.
Leave your message. Bye.</i>
<i>There is a more frequent place
in the nightmares than my bedroom, -</i>
<i>- even though the images that wreck
my sleep didn’t take place there.</i>
<i>That labyrinth of plants -</i>
<i>- that I used to find beautiful.</i>
<i>I've been there many times.</i>
<i>I studied the plants that
interested me the most.</i>
<i>I made a list of their scientific names
and drawings of their leaves.</i>
<i>I fell in love with the cacti.</i>
<i>I started to understand
their roughness. Their shapes.</i>
<i>To use them in my work.</i>
<i>I took my children.</i>
<i>Now, when I sleep, -</i>
<i>- the nursery reappears,
but as a terrifying sight.</i>
<i>The dirt soils my hands, -</i>
<i>- scratches my eyes.</i>
<i>The cacti only exist to rip my skin.</i>
Mrs. Diana?
Hi, Fernando.
- How's it going?
- I'm fine.
- Long time no see, huh?
- Yes, a long time.
Well, Andrés also barely shows up.
Are you here because of Néstor?
What happened?
Didn't you hear?
Yesterday, while going home...
He started feeling sick
and ended up in the hospital.
He's there with Mrs. Malena.
Can you tell me which hospital he's in?
<i>What usually makes me wake up
in horror, however, -</i>
<i>- are not the places where
the nightmares take place -</i>
<i>- but the faces of Andrés and Néstor.</i>
Please.
I come to visit Néstor Gorostiaga.
Can you tell me the number of his room?
Are you family?
Yes.
Gorostiaga, you said?
He's in ICU.
He can't have visitors right now.
<i>You can call me any time.</i>
<i>You have my number, right?</i>
Good. Thank you.
Can I help you with anything else?
No. Thanks.
<i>Andrés and Néstor.</i>
<i>Who always show up in any nightmare,
even when I seem to be alone.</i>
<i>Even when I'm with Mario,
or with the kids.</i>
<i>Even when there are no images
at all in the dream.</i>
<i>I know they are coming.</i>
<i>But do you know that, Mario?</i>
<i>Andrés.</i>
<i>Who seemed to love me,
who lived close to me for months -</i>
<i>- who showed me the nursery -</i>
<i>- who gave me the keys to his house.</i>
<i>And who seemed to become someone
else when I decided to leave him.</i>
<i>Andrés.</i>
<i>Who shouted:
"No bitch do that to me."</i>
<i>But do you know that, Mario?</i>
<i>Sometimes in my nightmares
you meet him.</i>
<i>Sometimes you agree with him.</i>
<i>You smile at each other,</i>
<i>And stare at me.</i>
<i>Why did you come here, Mario?</i>
<i>What do you have to say to one another?</i>
<i>This is still a nightmare.</i>
What is it you want, Mario?
<i>Sit.</i>
<i>I'll tell you quickly, then you leave.
I have other things to do. Ok?</i>
Shall we come in?
Yes.
How are the kids doing?
They called from the beach.
They're excited, gathering shells.
They want to bring them.
How nice.
Have you been in the
course all day long?
Yes.
It's finished. Today was the last day.
Tiresome?
Yes, very.
So...
You're able to fly now.
No.
No?
No.
Why?
Dr. Comas explained well to me that...
My problem...
Wasn't the airplane.
My fear was the sky.
You see? It isn't...
Something particular, specific.
It's general.
What do you mean?
I mean there's no cure.
There is no cure.
