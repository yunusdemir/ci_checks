Are you afraid?
You're my mother.
We know we're not related!
We've been intimate
for three years!
But, I am ,first,
my father's son.
Mother!
Why do you push me away?
We all know that
things can be changed.
We can not change
anything Mother!
And what if I try to?
Tell me!
Go great

The court presides.
Peace to all.

He's been diverted

Your Majesty...
the Emperor requests the presence
of the Empress and the two princes...
on the Chrysanthemum Terrace
tomorrow morning.
Your Highness, Prince Jai...
the Emperor has arrived.
Your son kneels before you.
Father,
it's a great honor...
to have this visit.
Now!
Father's prowess is unequalled.
The decision to send you
to the frontier...
was the right one.
I've come here today...
to remind you...
of your past mistakes.
The world
offers much...
Vile? You  have...
what's given...
never take by force!
what I don't give!
Father's wise words...
are acknowledged.
You'll return with me
to the Palace.
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives!
He's here.
Your son kneels before you.
Mother?
It's been more than
three years.
You've been well?
I've been
well enough.
And you?
I just couldn't...
ahh..
I just missed you.
Mother?
You must have suffered.
I wasn't hurt.
Charity seeks no recognition.
Virtue seeks no reward.
The harvest is abundant.
It is the Hour of the Rabbit.
Your Royal Highness...
the Empress has been
taking her herbs...
as you've
instructed.
Following Your wishes...
the black fungus is being added
by my daughter, Chan.
No ones knows.
How long has it been?
Ten days.
How are you and father?
Unchanged. I supposed.
Yes.
Why is so many
chrysanthemums Mother?
They are for the Festival.
Mother?
Mother!
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
What's going on?
Your Highness...
your servant does not know.
It is the third time
this has happened.
Mother, please!
What's wrong?
Go on and tell me!
You should rest Mother.
You know I can't yet...
I have to finish the...
chrysanthemums.
Have you been
taking your medicine?
You should go
visit your brothers?
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives!
I bow to my First Brother,
the Crown Prince Wan.
Hello Jai Second Brother!
Please!
Thank you.
Second Brother.
Hello, Yu!
I heard...
Father changed his plans...
and welcomed you back
personally.
Was it hard?
Being away?
You know...
Mother seems
very ill?
We fear, she's anemic.
She takes her
medicine often.
Mother's been
embroidering a lot!
It's all for the Festival.
Father!
Have you seen
the Crown Prince again?
Why would I visit the Crown Prince?
A father knows!
What do you know?
Go! go! See him.
More!
That's Persian black fungus!
It's very powerful.
Two grams a day,
for a short time...
can make you crazy.
Chan, clearly,
you haven't learned enough.
But the Empress...
Don't you breathe a word!
We'll be killed!
Law of the nation...
Precept of the home...
Ancient yet unchanged.
It is the Hour of the Dragon.
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.
So, you are Chan.
Yes. My name is Chan.
And our physician is your father?
Yes.
It seems that the Crown Prince
is somewhat pale.
Is the Empress
asking my opinion?
My job is to prepare
medicine.
I don't know much
with the Prince.
So be it.
Come in!
'On the highest mountain
all ascend...
but one brother is missing,
without berries in his hair.
Prince Jai has returned.
The family is reunited.
Who will tell me why...
we assemble on this terrace
every chrysanthemum festival?
Do you know?
Yes Father! On the ninth day
of the ninth month...
the sun and the moon
join together as one.
We call this the
Chrysanthemum Festival.
It symbolizes strength
and harmony of the family...
and we celebrate
on this terrace.
You have studied well!
The terrace is round.
The table is square.
Representing that
heaven is round?
And the earth is square.
The laws of  Heaven...
dictate the rules of earthly life...
under the circle,
within the square...
everyone has his proper placement.
This is called natural law.
So, all of my sons...
And to whom shall
take heed...
all relationships obey this law.
Are there any
request of me?
My Father...
I urgently ask
your permission...
to travel to Qingzhou.
So, you want to be
sent to the frontier?
I'd like to
view the world...
outside of this Palace Walls.
Anything else?
Father...
I request permission.
I'm listening?
I...
don' t know if it
is appropriate...
When you know
then you tell me.
Your medicine
was not finished!
at the Hour of the Dragon.
How much is  left?
Tell me!
Your Majesty...
there is a sip or two.
Pour it.
Yes.
Your Highness...
a change in my health,
perhaps.
Where did you hear
that from?.
She will have to take
all of her medicine.
Drink what you've
left over!
Third son, Yu!
Mother, listen to Father,
Please!
Mother! Drink it!
Remain kneeling...
until she drinks it!
Father...
Mother wont drink it.
Let her be?
Forget your request...
She needs it.
as life is governed
by law.
Mother...
you've been taking
this medicine for years.
Just one swallow...
why change?
Yes.
Doesn't it seems
strange?...
to quit?
Mother's symptoms...
make her unaware?
We know, Father!
You're being treated
well now..
with good medicine?
You had something
to tell me?
Father...
I know now...
the night of the
Chrysanthemum Festival...
I wish to command
the lmperial Guards.
I, too, want  to gain
experience.
Since Prince Jai has returned...
he will assume this duty.
Jai! My son.
Yes Father!
Are you ready to accept
this as your duty?
for the Festival...
they will be under your sole command.
My plans are made!
I will never disappoint
you Father!
Then you know
what needs to be done..
The Empress arrives.
Your wife kneels down
before you.
Do you know why I summoned you?
Today...
you acted against me.
Please! Watch closely...
I select each ingredient personally...
with utmost care.
This will cure your anemia.
I'm grateful
for His Highness!.
All good medicine tastes bitter.
You have excess bile...
poor digestion...
That is why you are stubborn...
You are listless and
quite lethargic...
this is all
very serious.
Symptoms of anemia.
I have been ill.
And your medicine...
would never assist
in the cure.
If your father were not
King of Liang...
I would not speak
to you...
with such restraint!
You had better understand...
that as long as I am the Emperor...
and you,  Empress...
we shall pretend
well!
The lmperial Family...
has an example to set.
As for this family...
I tolerate you...
because my concern...
is to maintain law
and order in the household!
Chickens roost.
Gentlemen to rest.
Streams run clear.
It is the Hour of the Snake.
Your servant kneels
before you.
The medicine
is ready now.
I Thank you.
Do you know what tomorrow is?
The Chrysanthemum Festival...
the day my birth mother died.
You were a baby
when she died...
and I was away at war
all of that time.
I never took proper care of you.
This has created a distance
between us...
yet you've always
been my favorite son.
I asked Jai to come back...
I gave him a duty.
What do you think will happen?
Father...
is planning to make...
Jai the Royal Crown Prince.
I sense your disapproval...
Then, I won't pursue it.
Father, please...
I am without talent...
I don't deserve the throne.
Twice before I begged of you
to appoint another heir.
I will follow your wish Father.
I'm back!
Will the Emperor allow you to leave?
When the festival ends...
will you ask once again?
I'm sure He will agree then.
When you go, don't forget...
to take me with you Wan.
After we get there...
we shall finally be together.
If years like forever...
It will happen!
Her Majesty the Empress arrives!
Your Majesty.
She can come out now.
What do you mean?
It's alright!
No!...
Do it!
Her punishment?
For seducing His Highness...
and trespassing...
by law twenty lashes of the whip...
branding of the face...
and banishment from the Palace.
How does that sound to you,  Your Highness?
She didn't do anything.
This was my fault, and I beg Your Highness...
please exercise forgiveness.
I was wrong to do this.
Fine.
I'll do it for now...
just don't think
it was for you.
Stand up!
We will make this easy.
But behave appropriately...
until the Festival.
You may leave me.
I have made the discovery...
Your Majesty requested.
it's the new ingredient...
the black fungus from Persia.
Two grams a day...
will cause you to
slowly lose your mind over time.
Thank you.
A payment is not necessary.
Then why helped me?
The Empress may think...
that I came...
because of the generous reward...
but I came...
simply because...
I hate the Emperor.
Only Your Majesty is
in a position to avenge me.
The branding?...
Why were you in jail?
I won't say...
I ask forgiveness.
Farewell.
Your Highness, Prince Wan.
The Empress has already retired.
Come here!
Father.
Your Majesty.
This is the wife
of the lmperial Doctor.
This woman broke in
into the Palace three days ago.
When I just caught her.
Raise your head!
Hmmn!
Free her!
Get out!
Wan...
you must never speak of
the events of this night.
Is that clear?
You can get up!
For twenty-five years.
I was certain...
that I would never see you again.
You ran off with
the Roral Doctor!
At that time you were
only a lowly captain...
plotting day and night
to become Emperor.
You were flattering the King of Liang...
Weren't you?
seeking to marry his daughter.
You planned meticulously to have
my entire family put in prison.
Later...
When I managed to get out.
You know, I almost died there.
It was the Imperial doctor who saved me.
Who should I have married then?
Why did you come here?
I'm just here to see my son.
You should not have to lie to me.
All I'm looking for is justice.
I'll do what's needed...
and see you're repaid in full.
The lmperial Doctor...
has served us for many years...
with impeccable conduct,
loyalty and honesty.
He is promoted
to Governor of Suzhou...
also Commander of Chariots.
He will depart immediately...
with his daughter, Chan.
This is the order of His Majesty.
We thank His Majesty!
Your humble servant
kneels before you.
Before I leave...
May I tend to Your Highness
once more.
You have served me
for how long now?
Fifteen years...
Your Majesty.
You should know that
if I've wronged you ever...
I'm deeply sorry.
Your Highness,
don't say that!
I would give my life
for and to thee...
Your wife is well?...
I hope.
She is.
She shall go with you
when you leave here.
Your Highness is too generous.
My gratitude... endless.
And the herbs...
I have prepared enough
for two months.
Just
command the pharmacist...
to heat up the dosage.
I kneel
before the Emperor.
Leave us.
I am here to honor the memory
of the Crown Prince's birth mother.
She died on this day.
For twenty years this image of her
has hanged here.
There's just one...
woman in your heart.
Need to say something?
So I hear...
you got an assassin.
You handled this interrogation?.
You wouldn't be questioning me?
I would never.
I shall go then.
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives.
Leave us now!
Mother?
For ten years, I've taken the herbs.
Ten days ago...
the formula tasted different...
this new ingredient was added.
Mother has been feeling ill!
because of this?
Father is killing you?
Listen!...
after the Chrysanthemum Festival...
you'll know the truth.
Each day, in front of your father...
I sustained a look of ignorance.
medicine...
the drink he gives me every
two hours is poison.
Pretending like I don't see.
I will die exactly how your
father wants me too...
I'll put a stop to this first!
At the Festival...
We will see the true end.
Do my brothers know about it?
Not yet.
Would you have gone ahead...
if I wasn't here?
I would.
So, why are you telling me this?
I want you to be Emperor.
Father will be killed then?
Only forced to abdicate...
No one will be killed.
Mother...
a son cannot stand in rebellion
against his father!
Whatever the circumstances...
he is still my father
and my Emperor.
My son...
I know this will be hard.
You can do what you feel.
Prayers in the Spring...
Tranquillity in the Fall...
The earth yields.
It is the Hour of the Monkey.
Mother!
You have my help mother.
You shall never drink this
so-called medicine again!
His Highness,
the Crown Prince arrives!
Mother called me here.
What is it?
You may leave me.
I just made you a new robe...
different from last year.
What do you think of this new addition?.
What does this mean?
It's for protection.
Protection? From What?
What exactly are you plotting?
Well? Son...
tomorrow night...
i just want you to wear this.
I refuse!
I command you
to wear it!
I won't!
No!
I won't!
You must stop
this now!
He's here!
I received the message...
that Your Highness was coming...
and I've been waiting.
I came here...
to ask you something.
Why was your mother at the Palace?
to see me.
Had she visited before?
No. Why? Something wrong?
Are you lying to me Chan?
Why would I?
I have no reason to
lie to you.
You know why my mother
keeps embroidering?
I just heard they are
for the Festival.
She ordered ten thousand from
the eunuch in charge of weaving.
Ten thousand?
But she had them delivered
to General Wu's army.
Are you sure about that?
Yes!
And who told you this?
Father mentioned it.
What else do you know?
That's all!
Are you there?
Chan?
Quick! my mother is coming.
Please hide!
I've got to get back to the Palace.
Something is going to happen.
Something horrible!
I must hurry...
Your servant kneels
before you.
Your Highness...
My wife!
Quickly! Kneel downto welcome
the Crowned Prince!
What are doing?
Get out now!
I ask forgiveness
for my wife your Highness?
How can you talk like that!
Get out!
Out!
Please forgive her.
Your Highness...
please forgive her.
Please forgive her.
I was such a fool.
to have you in the Palace
for so long.
Nonsense! Why would you say that.
You may never...
be together again.
But? Mother!
Promise me.
You  will no longer be together.
But he has to be warned!
Tonite! Something terrible
will...
You can't!
What were you thinking?
Chan...
Go outside.
For over ten years...
I never once asked
about your history.
What exactly have you been
hiding from me?
Where's Chan?
The Palace!
How could you
let her go!
I am the newly appointed
Governor of Suzhou!
Who are you?
Let's go!
Come on!
What you're hiding
must be important!
Quickly! Go save Chan!
No!
His Highness
the Crown Prince arrives.
Should you make your move?
you know.
You tell anybody?
It should not matter to you.
When will you make your move?
The Festival.
They are my matters?
You shouldn't be concerned?
But I am the Crowned Prince?
How can not it not concerned me.
The entire country is going
to think that I did it.
So what if you did plan it?
Huh?
You fool!
You should die!
Father was right!
You're out of control!
You're sick!
So you too!
You want me to go...
They'll kill me if you proceed
with your insane plan.
All you wanted from me
was to die, right?
Right?
You're right!...
Rest in peace!
Wan!
Wan!
Wan!
What have you done?
Help!
Your Majesty,
fortunately the wound is not fatal.
He will recover.
You're hiding
something else mother.
Why are you doing this to me?
It's something
I must do.
Don't do it.
You don't have to.
I'm begging you...
I know...
I can't stop now.
Listen!
Your father will be here
any moment now.
Wan? Please, let go!
You're keeping a secret.
You and the Empress.
I've noticed sometime now...
Eversince...
You've been intimate with her.
Just think how I feel?
You have no idea, my son.
I don't blame you.
I know...
I know it was she
who seduced you.
Father!
Jai! Where is your mother?
Father !..., Mother is still  dressing.
I'll go and get her.
These berries...
were your birth mother's favorite.
Even after the Festival...
you could see her wearing them...
to ward off evil.
Yes.
Every year, on this day...
you should too!
as an honor to her.
She would be very grateful.
I will.
His Highness!
His Highness, Prince Jai arrives!
Mother...
Is Wan okay?
He knows it all.
And will he tell?
Everything is ready.
Just the way
we want it.
I understand...
Wait Jai!
Come back.
Commanding Officer orders...
to reward all your hard work...
a grand banquet!
While  you feast...
your duties will be assumed by
our Commanding Officer.
His orders are received!
Mother! What's happening?
The Emperor wants to
kill our family.
But why?
Where is Father?
The Empress wants to help you both.
Please, this way.
Your Majesties - Emperor,
Empress...
the lmperial Doctor's
family is outside.
Let them inside.
You did this!
Get out!
I've made it here and I'm still alive!
It was beneath contempt...
to attack us under
the cloak of darkness.
Once again you've deceived me.
You are a coward and a hypocrite!
my daughter and I
stand here before you.
Kill us!
Come on!
You spied
for the Empress.
This is all your doing!
My daughter and my husband...
knew nothing about this!
They knew  too much of me.
Father...
Who is that lady?
Silence!
Listen!
I know who she is.
Your Highness!
The portrait you see
hanging on the wall?
Highness!
Your father's first wife...
your birth mother.
Father!...
You need to tell me?
She is.
She is.
Is this  what you wanted to happen?
Yes.
I wanted him to know the truth!
That his father has betrayed us!
You told me she died when I was a child!
Chan!
Chan!
Mother!...
Finally, you get what you wanted?
Chan!
Chan!
Chan!
Hiding anything more?
Wait and see!.
What have you done!?
Mother!..
This is all your fault!
I'm not a young kid!
You lied to me!
I know all about your affair!
I know you and
Jai have plans!
Well? How do you want them now?!
No!
Wan!
You're foolish!
I am not a fool!
Give the throne to me now!
I want it all!
I know you never cared?
You never liked me?
No one wanted me?!
You can run in hell!
You're insane!
He is your older brother!
Well? I don't care!
Let him die!
It doesn't matter!
Yahhhh!
I'm sorry.
Attack!
Attack!
Throw!
Shields up!
Throw!
Shields up!
Forward!
Forward!
Attack!
Do not harm Prince Jai!
Do not harm Prince Jai!
Throw!
Catch!
Ready!
Ready!
Ready!
Ready!
Ready!
Ready!
Ready!
Ready!
Shoot!
Hold the gates!
Take him!
Kneel!
Rise!
I lost my
dearest son.
He told me everything...
about your plan.
Well? I thought he would.
You've really lost your mind.
Execute!
I had plans as well.
Once the festival ended...
I plan to remove
Wan as Crown Prince...
and appoint you as my heir.
I told you before...
I shouldn't take ...
what i don't give.
I've been watching.
The lmperial Flag...
was the final warning.
I was aware...
that I could not
win this battle.
Kill me, or dismember me...
you will do as you wish...
but I need you to know, Father...
that I did not rebel...
for sake of the crown.
I did it for mother.
Heaven, earth, and man unite!
Fortune and prosperity to all...
Midnight...
The Hour of the Rat.
The Chrysanthemum Festival begins.
The phoenix spreads its wings.
Sun and moon shine bright.
The four seas rise.
Frontiers push back.
Humanity, wisdom, trust...
Ritual, righteousness, loyalty...
Deep virtue pervades.
Father to son... Wise kings all.
Follow the Heavens' way.
Peace and glory above...
Rain down...
On all nations below.
Your servant kneels before you.
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.
What is the punishment...
for acts of treason?
Your Royal Highness -
torn apart by five horses.
You hear?
I'm...
willing to spare you...
Only...
if you agree...
to one thing...
from this day...
only you will pour her medicine.
Mother...
your son failed.
I've promised...
I've tried.
