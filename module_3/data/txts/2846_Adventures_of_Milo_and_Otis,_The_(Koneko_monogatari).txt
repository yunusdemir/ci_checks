EXCEPT FOR THE ACTIVITY
UP IN THE HAYLOFT,
THE FARM WAS PRETTY QUIET
THAT MORNING.
THE NOISE UPSTAIRS
DIDN'T DISTURB
THE DOGS THAT SLEPT
IN THE BARN.
THEY COULD SLEEP
THROUGH ANYTHING.
BUT A LOT OF THE OTHER ANIMALS
WERE AWAKENED
BY ALL THAT SCURRYING
OVERHEAD.
SOME OF THEM
JUST ACCEPTED IT,
SOME WERE PRETTY ANNOYED,
AND A FEW
QUIETLY PLOTTED REVENGE.
BUT THE MOOD WAS VERY DIFFERENT
UP IN THE HAYLOFT.
THE FARM CAT HAD JUST
GIVEN BIRTH TO HER FIRST LITTER.
SHE WAS DETERMINED
TO BE A GOOD MOTHER
AND NEVER YELL
AT HER KITTENS.
BUT THAT APPROACH
WOULD NOT LAST VERY LONG
BECAUSE MILO,
ONE OF HER KITTENS,
WAS TROUBLE
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
AS SOON AS HE COULD WALK,
HE BEGAN WANDERING
TO THE EDGE OF THE HAYLOFT.
"MILO, DEAR," HIS MOTHER SAID,
"THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA!"
"COME BACK HERE, MILO!"
SHE YELLED.
THE FIRST ANIMAL MILO MET
OUTSIDE OF HIS FAMILY
WAS OTIS,
ONE OF THE BARN PUPPIES.
"YOU'RE A STRANGE-LOOKING CAT,"
MILO SAID.
"I'M NOT A CAT.
I'M A DOG," OTIS REPLIED.
MILO TRIED TO
FIGURE THIS OUT AND SAID,
"ALL RIGHT, A DOG.
I UNDERSTAND.
BUT REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
WE'RE ALL CATS, RIGHT?"
"NO," OTIS BARKED.
"NO. DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
I'M A DOG.
I'M A DOG."
NEVERTHELESS,
AS IF THEY KNEW
HOW MUCH THEY WOULD
NEED EACH OTHER,
MILO AND OTIS
BECAME BEST FRIENDS.
PRETTY SOON IT WAS THE BEGINNING
OF A BIG DAY FOR MILO.
[COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO]
THE KITTENS WERE NOW BIG ENOUGH
TO LEAVE THE HAYLOFT
AND SEE THE WORLD
BEYOND THE BARN.
AS USUAL,
MILO GOT INTO TROUBLE.
HE WAS THE FIRST TO START
CALLING OUT FOR FOOD.
[MEOW]
[MEOW MEOW]
"MILO, FINISH YOUR BREAKFAST,
OR THE PUPPIES WILL GET IT!"
HIS MOTHER YELLED.
IT SEEMED TO MILO
SHE YELLED A LOT.
"MILO, DID YOU HEAR ME?"
"AND, MILO, I'VE TOLD YOU
AGAIN AND AGAIN,
PLEASE, DON'T WALK
ON THE CHICKENS!"
"NOW, LISTEN CAREFULLY,"
MILO'S MOTHER SAID,
ONCE AGAIN
TRYING TO SPEAK SOFTLY.
"THIS IS THE DOCK.
DOWN THERE IS THE RIVER.
"YOU MUST NEVER GO TOO CLOSE
TO THE EDGE OF THE DOCK.
EVERYONE UNDERSTAND?"
"WHAT'S TOO CLOSE?"
MILO ASKED.
"IS THIS TOO CLOSE?
OOH!"
"MILO, GET BACK HERE!"
HIS MOTHER DEMANDED,
BUT MILO, HE WAS
SWEPT AWAY BY THE RIVER,
AND HIS MOTHER
HAD TO GO AFTER HIM.
"ALL OF YOU BACK ON THE DOCK,"
SHE ORDERED.
"BEHAVE WHILE I'M GONE.
MILO. MILO, I'M COMING."
"OH, MILO," HIS MOTHER SAID,
"LOOK AT YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?"
"YES," MILO MEOWED.
"DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
FOLLOW ME TO THE SHORE?"
"I-I THINK SO,"
MILO SAID.
"ALL RIGHT. BE CAREFUL,"
HIS MOTHER ORDERED
AND BEGAN SWIMMING.
"ALL RIGHT."
[MEOW]
"OH, ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT GOING TO YELL,"
HIS MOTHER SAID.
"I'M JUST GLAD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
"DRY YOURSELF OFF
LIKE THIS
AND FOLLOW ME BACK HOME."
"CAN WE SWIM BACK?"
MILO ASKED.
"THAT WAS FUN!"
"MILO, GET OVER HERE!"
THE MONTHS PASSED,
AND THE FARM WAS HUMMING
WITH THE SOUNDS OF SUMMER.
MILO AND OTIS GREW BIG ENOUGH
TO PLAY OUTSIDE BY THEMSELVES.
MILO HAD SOME HIDING PLACES
HE COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY OUT.
OTIS SNIFFED AROUND
THE YARD FOR A WHILE.
"YOU'RE IN THE PIPE, MILO.
TRY AGAIN."
"HOW DOES HE DO THAT?"
MILO WONDERED,
AND HE TRIED ANOTHER SPOT.
"NOT THE PUSS-IN-BOOTS TRICK,"
OTIS GROANED.
"CAT'S IN THE CAN!"
OTIS SHOUTED,
AND MILO SLIPPED OFF
TO ANOTHER HIDING PLACE.
IT WASN'T EASY
FOOLING A DOG'S NOSE.
OTIS STARTED FOLLOWING
HIS TRAIL IMMEDIATELY
AND FOUND HIM AGAIN.
MILO TRIED A HARDER SPOT.
BUT OTIS
FOUND HIM THERE, TOO.
NOW MILO NEEDED
A BRILLIANT IDEA.
HE THOUGHT OF A PLACE
WHERE OTIS COULD NEVER
SNIFF HIM OUT.
IT WORKED,
BUT MILO WONDERED IF IT WAS
REALLY WORTH THE TROUBLE.
THE FOLLOWING DAY,
THE HEN HOUSE WAS IN AN UPROAR.
MILO AND OTIS WENT TO SEE
WHAT THE COMMOTION WAS ABOUT.
SUDDENLY,
ONE CHICKEN'S VOICE RANG OUT.
"OK, YOU LOT. BAWK BAWK.
CLEAR OUT. CLEAR OUT."
ALL THE HENS LEFT
IN A CLUCKING FLURRY
BECAUSE THAT WAS
GLORIA TALKING,
A YOUNG CHICKEN WHO HAD
SCRATCHED AND PECKED HER WAY
TO THE TOP RUNG
OF THE HEN HOUSE.
GLORIA HAD A GOOD REASON
FOR WANTING TO BE ALONE.
"THERE IT IS, FELLAS,"
GLORIA CACKLED,
"MY FIRST EGG.
KEEP AN EYE ON IT, OTIS,
WHILE I SPREAD THE WORD."
OTIS TOOK THE EGG-WATCHING
ASSIGNMENT VERY SERIOUSLY.
"DID YOU HEAR ABOUT GLORIA?"
"OH, THE EGG."
"IS SHE STAYING HOME WITH IT
OR GOING BACK TO WORK?"
"WANT ME TO KICK IT
BACK TO YOU?" MILO ASKED.
"NOW STOP THAT,"
OTIS SAID.
"I KICKED IT BY ACCIDENT.
"WE CAN'T PLAY GAMES
WITH THE EGG.
LEAVE IT ALONE."
"LOOK, THIS ISN'T FUNNY,"
OTIS SAID.
"GLORIA GAVE US
A JOB TO DO."
"HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO
STICK AROUND THIS HEN HOUSE?"
"UNTIL GLORIA COMES BACK.
"MAYBE YOU DON'T REALIZE IT,
"BUT THIS IS A MAJOR DAY
FOR ME BECAUSE...
"WELL,
MAYBE YOU DON'T REALIZE
THAT THIS IS THE DAY
I'VE BECOME A WATCHDOG."
NATURALLY, THE SIGHT OF A DOG
AND A CAT WATCHING AN EGG
BROUGHT THE USUAL STRING
OF GAWKERS...
AND THRILL-SEEKERS.
SOME STRANGE NOISES BROUGHT MILO
OUT OF THE HEN HOUSE.
WHAT WAS ALL THIS ABOUT?
[BIRD CAWING]
[CAW CAW]
"HEY, COULD YOU CUT THAT OUT?"
MILO SAID.
"HEY!"
BUT THE BIRD IGNORED HIM.
"HEY! YOUR SINGING STINKS.
WILL YOU QUIT IT?
HELLO IN THERE."
"OTIS. OTIS. COME HERE, OTIS,"
A FROG CROAKED.
"WHAT IS IT?" OTIS SAID.
"I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE EGG-SITTING."
"YOUR CAT BUDDY'S GOT
THE WHOLE FARM CRAZY.
DO SOMETHING, AND QUICK."
THE FROG WAS RIGHT.
AT THAT MOMENT,
MILO WAS TEASING A CRAB,
BUT THIS TIME,
SOMEONE GOT THE BEST OF MILO.
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
"HE DESERVED IT,"
THE FROG CROAKED.
"HE'S MY FRIEND,"
OTIS SAID.
"HE STILL DESERVED IT."
THE TROUBLE
WITH GUARDING AN EGG IS
YOU HAVE TO
ALWAYS BE ON GUARD,
AND OUTSIDE, MILO AND OTIS
SUDDENLY REMEMBERED.
"AAH.
THE EGG!"
"FREEZE!" OTIS BARKED.
"TOUCH THAT EGG,
AND YOU'RE DEAD MEAT."
"I MEAN IT, PUNK,"
OTIS GROWLED.
"JUST TRY SOMETHING.
MAKE MY DOGGY DAY."
"LIGHTEN UP.
I DIDN'T TOUCH
YOUR CRUDDY EGG,"
THE HEDGEHOG GRUMBLED.
"PROBABLY ROTTEN, ANYWAY."
MILO WANTED JUST ONE MORE LOOK
AT THAT WEIRD ANIMAL.
[HISSING]
THE NOISE ATTRACTED
A GROUP OF LOCAL SNOOPS
LOOKING TO DIG UP
SOME SCANDAL.
[CRACK]
BUT MILO'S ATTENTION
WAS FOCUSED SOMEWHERE ELSE.
[CRACK CRACK]
[CHEEP CHEEP]
[CHEEP CHEEP]
"MILO," OTIS SAID,
"I-I THINK
WE'RE HAVING A BABY."
THE CHICK DRIED ITSELF OFF,
LOOKED AT OTIS,
AND CHEEPED,
"MOMMY. MOMMY. MOMMY.
MOMMY. MOMMY. MOMMY."
"I'M NOT YOUR MOMMY,"
OTIS SAID.
"YOUR MOMMY'S A CHICKEN."
THE OTHER ANIMALS TOLD OTIS
HE'D BETTER TAKE THE CHICK
TO GLORIA QUICKLY,
WHICH HE DID,
BUT THE CHICK KEPT
COMING BACK TO OTIS.
"MOMMY. MOMMY.
HA HA. MOMMY."
"I'M NOT YOUR MOMMY,"
OTIS SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN.
"NOW, GO BACK TO GLORIA.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YOU'RE A CHICKEN,
NOT A DOG."
"WOOF," THE CHICK PEEPED.
"WOOF. WOOF. MOMMY."
THEY TRIED TO MAKE THE CHICK
JOIN THE OTHER CHICKENS.
"YOU WANT TO BE A DOG,"
OTIS BARKED,
"HERE'S WHAT
YOU'VE GOT TO DO.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE A ROUGH,
TOUGH, MEAN FIGHTING DOG."
THE CHICK DIDN'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THIS.
"OK, PUPPY,"
OTIS ORDERED, "YOUR TURN.
GIVE IT A TRY.
GIVE IT A TRY."
"MOMMY. CHICKEN MOMMY,"
THE CHICK PEEPED
AND RAN TO GLORIA.
"IT WORKED," OTIS THOUGHT.
"I'LL MISS HIM,
BUT AT LEAST HE FOUND OUT
HE'S A CHICKEN."
"ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING?" OTIS ASKED.
"SURE.
THE DOCK IS THIS WAY.
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE RIVER.
COME ON," SAID MILO.
OTIS HAD A FEELING
THERE WAS TROUBLE AHEAD.
"LOOK AT THIS THING,"
MILO SAID.
"DO YOU THINK
WE CAN EAT IT?"
"WHO WOULD EAT SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT?"
OTIS REPLIED AND CONTINUED ON
TO THE RIVER.
THEN IT HAPPENED.
WHEN OTIS WAS SITTING
ON THE DOCK, WASTING TIME--
"OOH! COR!"
[QUACK QUACK]
OTIS DRIED OFF
AND CAME BACK
TO SETTLE THE SCORE
WITH THAT, THAT THING.
MILO, MEANWHILE, HAD STUMBLED ON
AN EXCELLENT HIDING PLACE.
HE WAS SURE OTIS WOULD NEVER
BE ABLE TO FIND HIM THIS TIME.
"SURPRISE!" MILO SHOUTED.
"I'VE FINALLY FOOLED YOU."
OTIS BARKED, "GET OUT OF THERE
BEFORE SOMETHING HAPPENS."
BUT SOMETHING DID.
"HA HA! QUICK, JUMP IN!
THIS'LL BE FUN!" MILO SHOUTED.
OTIS DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.
"THIS IS GREAT!
COME WITH ME."
MILO WAS HAVING
A TERRIFIC TIME.
OTIS WAS PRETTY SCARED.
HE KNEW HE HAD TO RESCUE MILO.
HE RAN ALONGSIDE THE RIVER,
TRYING TO KEEP UP,
AND WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS.
THEN OTIS SAW
A BRIDGE UP AHEAD.
MAYBE HE COULD JUMP
OFF THE BRIDGE INTO THE BOX
IF HE HURRIED,
BUT HE WAS TOO LATE.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY
TO CATCH UP WITH MILO NOW.
"OH, BOY!
"HERE WE GO.
OOF! COR!"
BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.
OTIS JUST COULDN'T
SWIM FAST ENOUGH,
AND THE RIVER TOOK MILO
FARTHER DOWNSTREAM.
MILO WASN'T REALLY WORRIED
UNTIL HE LOST SIGHT OF OTIS.
SUDDENLY, HE HEARD SOMETHING
MOVING IN THE BUSHES.
WAS IT OTIS?
DEFINITELY NOT.
MILO TRIED TO DUCK
SO THE BEAR WOULDN'T SEE HIM.
BUT THE BOX WAS DRIFTING
RIGHT TOWARDS THE HUNGRY ANIMAL.
"CLOSE CALL," SAID MILO,
POKING HIS HEAD UP,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
MUCH TOO SOON.
THE BEAR SAW WHAT
WAS IN THAT BOX.
[MEOW]
THEN CAME OTIS.
HE SURVEYED THE SCENE
AND KNEW--
A DOG'S GOT TO DO
WHAT A DOG'S GOT TO DO.
SUDDENLY,
OTIS STARTED SWIMMING AWAY
AND SAID TO HIMSELF,
"WHAT AM I DOING?
THAT BEAR IS
10 TIMES MY SIZE."
OTIS CAME UP WITH
A MORE SENSIBLE PLAN.
HE RAN UP ON THE RIVERBANK,
LEADING THE BEAR
AWAY FROM MILO.
THE BEAR FOLLOWED HIM
AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT
THE ORANGE CAT IN THE BOX.
MILO KEPT DRIFTING ALONG,
BUT HE WAS GETTING
A LITTLE CONCERNED
BECAUSE THE RIVER
WAS BEGINNING TO MOVE FASTER...
AND FASTER.
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW]
[MEOW MEOW]
MILO WAS ALL RIGHT,
EXCEPT FOR BEING WET.
HE'D LOST TRACK
OF OTIS NOW,
AND HE WAS DRIFTING FARTHER
AND FARTHER FROM HOME.
[MEOW]
BY THE TIME THE MOON ROSE,
THE RIVER HAD CARRIED MILO
DEEP INTO THE FOREST.
NOW AND THEN,
HE SAW SOME EYES FLASHING
AMONG THE TREES...
AND HE HEARD
MYSTERIOUS HOOTS
AND GROWLS
AND CRIES IN THE NIGHT.
HIS TRIP DOWN THE RIVER
WASN'T FUN ANYMORE.
IT HAD TURNED INTO SOMETHING
LONELY AND FRIGHTENING.
HE BEGAN TO WISH HE'D
NEVER JUMPED INTO THIS BOX.
HE BEGAN TO WISH
HE WAS HOME.
IN THE WATER, MILO COULD SEE
THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON.
IT SEEMED TO BE TREMBLING
AS MUCH AS HE WAS
IN THE CHILLY, MISTY NIGHT.
SLEEP WAS NOT POSSIBLE.
HE DRIFTED ON
THROUGH THE DARKNESS,
HOPING TO FIND THE MORNING
WAITING JUST AROUND THE BEND.
WHEN DAYLIGHT CAME,
MILO SAW A FARM
ON THE RIVERBANK.
FOR ONE HAPPY MOMENT,
HE THOUGHT HE WAS HOME
AND CRIED OUT FOR JOY,
BUT...HE LOOKED AGAIN.
THOSE COWS
WERE ALL STRANGERS.
HE REMEMBERED HE WAS
FAR AWAY FROM HIS FARM.
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHEN
HE WOULD SEE IT AGAIN.
OTIS HAD NOT
GIVEN UP HIS CHASE,
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.
HE WAS RUNNING ALONG
THE RIVERBANK IN HOT PURSUIT.
TO KEEP UP HIS SPIRITS,
HE BEGAN SINGING
A DOG MARCHING SONG.
"?? HERE COMES THE DOG ??
"?? STRONG AND BRAVE,
WOOF! ??
"?? HERE COMES THE DOG,
YOUR LIFE HE-- ??
OH!"
HE THEN DECIDED
TO SKIP THE WHOLE THING.
OTIS FOLLOWED THE RIVER
UNTIL IT FLOWED
INTO THE WETLANDS,
AND HE CAME
TO A FORBIDDING PLACE,
A PLACE LIKE NONE
HE'D EVER SEEN BEFORE--
THE DEADWOOD SWAMP,
A BOG WHERE SKELETON TREES GREW
WITHOUT LEAVES OR BRANCHES
AND WHERE
NO CREATURE COULD LIVE,
EXCEPT FOR THE DREADED
DEADWOOD BIRDS,
AND ONE OF THEM WAS PERCHING
ON A FAMILIAR WOODEN BOX.
"WOOF! OK, PUNK,"
OTIS BARKED.
"THERE'S THE BOX.
NOW, WHERE'S THE CAT?"
"POOR CAW-CAW-CAT. SO SAD,"
THE BIRD CROAKED.
"LOOK IN THE BOX."
OTIS PREPARED HIMSELF
AND PEEKED IN THE BOX
AND SAW...
ONLY A SOLITARY
BLACK FEATHER,
AND THE BIRD
FLEW AWAY CACKLING.
"CAW CAW CAW!"
MILO WAS NOWHERE NEAR
THE DEADWOOD SWAMP.
AFTER HIS BOX GOT STUCK,
HE RAN FROM THOSE BIRDS
AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD.
NOW HE FOUND HIMSELF
IN A BURNING VALLEY.
THE GROUND WAS HOT.
THE SMOKE MADE HIS EYES STING.
HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.
MILO RAN UNTIL HE CAME
TO AN OPEN MEADOW
WHERE HE SAW AN ANIMAL
HE'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
AND FEELING PRETTY HUNGRY,
HE IMMEDIATELY WONDERED,
"IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU CAN EAT?"
PERHAPS NOT, BUT EVEN IF
THIS CREATURE WASN'T FOOD,
MAYBE HE HAD SOME
HIDDEN AWAY.
"HELLO. SOMEONE THERE?"
THE FOX CALLED.
MILO KEPT HIMSELF
WELL-HIDDEN.
"OH, WELL.
TIME FOR LUNCH BREAK, ANYWAY,"
WHICH WAS EXACTLY
WHAT MILO WANTED TO HEAR.
HE TRAILED THE FOX,
WAITING TO SEE JUST WHAT
WAS ON HIS LUNCH MENU.
"I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL,"
MILO THOUGHT.
"I MUST STAY OUT OF SIGHT
AND KEEP ABSOLUTELY SILENT."
"I KNOW I PUT IT HERE,"
THE FOX SAID.
"THERE IT IS.
MMM! GULP."
AND MILO'S MOUTH WATERED
WHEN HE SAW THE FOX HOLDING
A PLUMP, JUICY MUSKRAT.
THE FOX FELT
SOMEONE WATCHING HIM.
"HELLO. WHO'S THERE?
NO SENSE TAKING CHANCES
WITH A LOVELY MEAL LIKE THIS,"
AND HE BEGAN
BURYING HIS LUNCH
WHERE HE FIGURED
NO ONE WOULD FIND IT.
"HERE, MY PRECIOUS MUSKRAT.
YOU SHOULD BE SAFE THERE
TILL DINNERTIME," THE FOX SAID.
MILO CREPT SLOWLY
DOWN THE TREE
AND WATCHED THE FOX
RUN OVER THE HORIZON.
AND THEN,
ONCE ON THE GROUND,
MILO KNEW JUST HOW
TO GET HIS PAWS
ON A BIG,
TASTY MUSKRAT LUNCH.
OTIS, MEANWHILE, HAD TRAVELED
THROUGH THE WETLANDS
TO A BEACH
FULL OF CLAM HOLES.
A CLAM MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP HIM,
BUT HOW DOES A DOG
TALK TO A CLAM?
HE REMEMBERED THERE WAS ONE
MAGIC WORD EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD,
AND THAT WAS "PLEASE."
HE MARCHED UP
TO A CLAM HOLE AND SAID,
"EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
OH. OH."
BUT OTIS HAD A BIGGER PROBLEM
THAN RUDE CLAMS.
THE CLOUDS WERE GETTING
DARKER AND DARKER,
AND A CHILLY WIND WAS WHIPPING
ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE.
MILO WAS SEVERAL MILES
FROM THE BEACH,
CAUGHT IN THE SAME STORM.
HE GOT A LITTLE WET,
AND HE FELT AWFULLY LONESOME
WITHOUT OTIS,
BUT AT LEAST HE WAS SAFE.
AT THE SHORE...
OTIS WAS NOT SO LUCKY.
THE TIDE CAME IN SO FAST,
THE ROCK OTIS HAD
BEEN SITTING ON
WAS COMPLETELY
SURROUNDED BY WATER.
SOON HIS DRY ROCK
WOULD BE UNDERWATER.
THE BEACH WAS FAR,
AND THE WATER WAS ROUGH.
HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO
SWIM TO SHORE,
AND THE WATER
WAS GROWING HIGHER.
NOW THE WATER
WAS UP TO HIS PAWS.
HE'D HAVE TO TRY TO SWIM.
HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH,
BUT JUST WHEN HE WAS
READY TO DIVE IN...
"OH, NOT AGAIN,"
THE SEA TURTLE GURGLED.
"EVERY TIME
THE TIDE COMES IN,
SOME FOOL GETS
STUCK OUT HERE."
OTIS WASN'T SURE
WHAT THIS TURTLE WANTED.
"DO YOU WANT A RIDE
BACK TO SHORE, OR NOT?
DON'T YOU KNOW
I CAME TO SAVE YOU?"
"NO," OTIS SAID,
"I DIDN'T KNOW THAT."
"WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.
GET ON."
"NOW, JUST STAY ON THE SHORE
WHERE YOU BELONG,"
THE TURTLE GRUMBLED.
"THANKS FOR SAVING ME,"
OTIS SAID.
"NEXT TIME
THE TIDE COMES IN,
"I'LL HAVE TO RESCUE
SOMEBODY ELSE.
WHAT A LIFE."
"YOU SAVED MINE."
"I SAVE SOMEONE EVERY MONTH.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?"
"NO," SAID OTIS,
"I DIDN'T KNOW THAT."
"WELL," SAID THE TURTLE,
"NOW YOU KNOW."
"OH, DEAR.
BACK TO SEA."
UNDER A FRESH, BRIGHT SKY,
OTIS RESUMED
HIS SEARCH FOR MILO.
HE SAW IN THE DISTANCE
AN ANIMAL THAT HE THOUGHT
MIGHT BE HELPFUL.
"?? DA DA DA
DA DA DA DA ??
"?? DA DA DA DA DA ??
"?? AL LA DA DA DA ??
"?? DA DA DA DA DA DA ??
"?? AL LA DA
DO DO DO DO DA ??
"?? DA DA DA DA DA DA ??
"?? AH DA DA DA
DA DA DA ??
"?? DA DA DA YA LA ??
"?? BA DA YA
DA DA DA DA DA ??
"?? DA YA DA DA DA DA ??
"?? DA DA DO DO DO ??
"?? DA DA DA-- ????
"OH! AHH.
"COR.
OH, MUCH BETTER."
"EXCUSE ME,"
OTIS CALLED OUT.
"I'M LOOKING FOR A FRIEND."
"I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
TO PLAY WITH," THE FOX SAID.
"RACE ME ACROSS THE STREAM."
"I HAVEN'T GOT TIME,"
OTIS SAID,
SENSING THIS FOX
WOULDN'T BE ANY GREAT HELP.
"WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU?"
"I'M A DOG, OF COURSE,"
OTIS ANSWERED.
"YOU HAVE NO TAIL."
OTIS WAS OUTRAGED.
"I CERTAINLY DO."
"YOU CALL THAT A TAIL?
THIS IS A TAIL,"
AND WITH THAT,
THE FOX JUMPED AWAY LAUGHING.
MILO, FAR AWAY,
STUMBLED UPON A ROAD
THAT LOOKED CLEAR AND SAFE.
HE MARVELED AT THIS ROAD
MADE OF WOOD AND IRON
AND DECIDED TO SEE
WHERE IT WOULD TAKE HIM.
BUT THEN...
MILO HAD DUCKED
JUST IN TIME.
"WHAT WAS THAT?"
HE WONDERED.
"IT COULD HAVE
RUN OVER ME."
BUT MILO WAS DETERMINED.
HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO FOLLOW
THE WOOD AND IRON ROAD,
ALTHOUGH HE'D CERTAINLY
KEEP ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR ANOTHER
OF THOSE NOISY ANIMALS.
THE IRON ROAD LED MILO
TO A MEADOW
OF WILD COTTON BLOSSOMS.
NOW MILO WAS PLENTY TIRED.
MAYBE SOMEONE
COULD HELP HIM
FIND A SAFE PLACE
TO REST FOR A WHILE.
MAYBE SOMEONE LIKE...
HER.
"YOU LOOK TIRED AND THIRSTY,"
THE DEER WHISPERED.
"FOLLOW ME. BOUND WITH ME
THROUGH FIELDS OF CLOUDS,"
THE DEER SAID.
"I-I'M NOT SURE CATS
KNOW HOW TO BOUND," MILO SAID.
"JUST LET YOUR HEART LEAD,
AND YOUR FEET WILL FOLLOW,
"AND YOU'LL BOUND AND LEAP
LIKE A GENTLE BREEZE,
BOUND AND LEAP
LIKE A ZEPHYR SET FREE."
"IT JUST DOESN'T
LOOK RIGHT WHEN I DO IT."
"FROLIC WITH ME, FRIEND.
COME FROLIC. FROLIC."
"OK. LOOK, I'VE GOT IT.
I'M FROLICKING.
I'M FROLICKING. YOU SEE?"
"YOU CAN STOP FROLICKING NOW,"
THE DEER COOED.
SHE SHOWED MILO
TO THE COOL WATER
OF A FOREST POOL.
"I THINK I'M A LITTLE
TUCKERED OUT," MILO SAID.
"IT IS POSSIBLE TO OVERFROLIC,"
THE DEER MURMURED.
"HERE. LET ME SHOW YOU
A PLACE WHERE WE CAN REST,"
AND THE DEER TOOK MILO
TO A SOFT MOSSY SPOT
ON THE FOREST FLOOR,
AND MILO WAS ASLEEP
WITHIN MOMENTS.
OTIS KNEW HE WAS
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
HE HAD TRAILED MILO
FROM THE DEADWOOD SWAMP
TO THE FOX'S MEADOW.
IF HE JUST KEPT GOING,
MAYBE HE'D FINALLY FIND
THE FRIEND HE MISSED SO MUCH.
BUT NOW IT WAS THE END
OF A LONG DAY OF HARD TRAVELING.
[WHIMPERING]
AS EVENING WAS FALLING,
MILO DECIDED THE SAFEST PLACE
TO SPEND THE NIGHT
WOULD BE IN A TREE.
HE SETTLED DOWN
AND WATCHED THE SUNSET,
WONDERING WHAT
SORTS OF CREATURES
WOULD BEGIN STIRRING
AFTER DARK.
"AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP HERE?"
THE STRANGE BIRD
SAID TO MILO.
"HIDING FROM THE SCREECH OWLS,
I SUPPOSE."
"SORRY," MILO SAID.
"DOES THIS NEST
BELONG TO YOU?"
"YES. IT'S NOT JUST ANY NEST,
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW.
I'M THE NIGHT BIRD,
AND THAT IS A DREAMING NEST."
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"
MILO ASKED.
"ANYONE SLEEPING THERE
WILL HAVE HIS SLEEP
FLOODED WITH DREAMS,"
THE BIRD SAID,
"BUT IT'S A SAFE PLACE,
"SAFE FROM
THOSE SCREECH OWLS,
"SO SETTLE DOWN
IN THE NEST, DEAR CAT,
"AND BE PREPARED
FOR THE DREAMS.
"THEY MAY BE SAD
OR FRIGHTENING OR BEAUTIFUL,
"BUT SLEEPING IN THAT NEST,
DREAMS WILL SURELY COME."
AND MILO'S DREAMS BEGAN
ALMOST THE MOMENT
HE WAS ASLEEP.
FIRST, A SWEET DREAM
ABOUT BEING BACK ON THE FARM...
AND SEEING OLD FRIENDS...
AND ABOUT THE TIME
HIS MOTHER LEFT HIM
WITH A DOTING BABYSITTER.
AND THEN CAME A DREAM
THAT WAS VERY SAD.
A DREAM ABOUT OTIS
AND HOW THEY USED TO PLAY
TOGETHER WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.
OH, WOULD IT EVER
BE LIKE THIS AGAIN?
WOULD HE EVER SEE OTIS AGAIN?
IT SEEMED SO REAL.
MILO COULD ALMOST HEAR
OTIS' VOICE.
[SQUEALING]
BUT IT WASN'T
OTIS' VOICE AT ALL.
IT WAS A CRY FOR HELP
FROM DOWN ON THE GROUND.
MILO WOKE UP, AND FORGETTING
ALL ABOUT THE SCREECH OWLS,
HE CLIMBED DOWN THE TREE
TOWARDS THE DESPERATE CRY.
MILO HID AS AN OWL
SWOOPED DOWN
AND CARRIED OFF A FIELD MOUSE.
AND THOUGH HE WAS
A LITTLE SCARED,
MILO STILL FOLLOWED
THE CRIES FOR HELP.
"HELP!"
"PLEASE,
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
"OW-OWW!
OW! MY LEG IS CAUGHT!"
THE PIG CRIED.
"AND THAT BIRD,
HE'LL BE BACK."
"TAKE IT EASY," SAID MILO,
WORKING QUICKLY
TO FREE THE PIG'S FOOT.
"YOU'RE FINE," MILO SAID.
"NOW, DO YOU KNOW A PLACE
WHERE WE'D BE SAFE?"
"BACK WITH MY FAMILY,"
SAID THE PIG.
"COME WITH ME.
COME ON."
THE PIG'S FAMILY SQUEALED
WITH JOY
WHEN THEY SAW HIM RETURN.
AND OVER THE NOISE,
THE PIG YELLED,
"HEY, MOM,
HERE COMES THE CAT.
YEAH,
THE CAT THAT SAVED ME."
THE PIGS OFFERED MILO
A PLACE TO SLEEP.
THE NEXT MORNING,
HE WOKE UP AND THOUGHT,
"THESE PIGS ARE ALL RIGHT,
FRIENDLY AND KIND,
JUST A NICE BUNCH OF PIGS,"
BUT THEN
THE MOTHER PIG SQUEALED,
"BREAKFAST!"
AND THE TABLE MANNERS
OF THIS FAMILY
CAME AS QUITE A SURPRISE
TO MILO.
THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS
A LITTLE TOO MESSY
FOR ANY CAT TO TAKE,
BUT THAT WAS THE WAY
IT WAS DONE AT MEALTIME
IN THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY.
MILO WENT TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HIS FRIEND,
WHO STILL HAD
SOME BREAKFAST ON HIS FACE.
"COME ON," SAID THE CAT,
"YOU'VE AT LEAST GOT
TO KEEP YOUR FACE CLEAN."
AFTER GOOD-BYES, MILO REFLECTED
ON THE FAMILY HE'D STAYED WITH.
"JEEZ," HE THOUGHT,
"NO WONDER THEY CALL THEM PIGS."
AFTER A WHOLE DAY
OF TRAVELING,
MILO ARRIVED AT A BROOK.
IN THE WATER,
HE COULD SEE SOME
DELICIOUS-LOOKING TROUT.
AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION,
HE FIGURED OUT HOW
HE COULD CATCH ONE.
"THAT CAT HAS
GOT TO BE KIDDING,"
MUTTERED A NEARBY RACCOON.
BUT ALL AT ONCE...
[MEOW]
MILO CAUGHT ONE.
AND THE RACCOON WANTED IT.
"HEY, CAT. NICE FISH,"
THE RACCOON SAID.
"TOO BAD IT'S GOING TO BE
THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY."
BUT THE RACCOON WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE INTERESTED
IN MILO'S FISH.
THEY BATTLED OVER THE TROUT
UNTIL THE BEAR CAUGHT SIGHT
OF SOMETHING
BIGGER AND TASTIER--
A CAT.
MILO KNEW HE WOULDN'T
HAVE A CHANCE
AGAINST THE BEAR
ON THE GROUND,
BUT PERHAPS IN THE AIR.
MILO WAS SAFE,
BUT NEVER DID GET HIS LUNCH.
PRETTY SOON HE HAD
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR A MEAL.
"SOME SEA GULL EGGS.
MIGHT BE TASTY," MILO THOUGHT.
[SQUAWK SQUAWK]
BUT SUDDENLY UP ABOVE
A SEA GULL SCREAMED,
"CAT! CAT! THERE'S A CAT
NEAR THE BABIES!"
A CHORUS OF BIRDS JOINED IN,
"CAT! CAT!
COME ON! PECK HIM AWAY!
PECK HIM AWAY FROM THE NESTS!"
THE SEA GULLS WERE PECKING HIM,
HURTING HIM.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY
FOR MILO TO ESCAPE.
"ALL THIS...
JUST FOR A LUNCH,"
MILO THOUGHT TO HIMSELF.
"WELL, WHO EVER HEARD
OF EATING SEA GULL EGGS ANYWAY?"
MILO CLIMBED OUT OF THE SEA
FEELING SALTY, WET,
AND COLD.
THERE HAD BEEN TIMES
HE'D LOOKED A LOT BETTER, TOO.
AT LEAST HE CAME TO SHORE
NEAR A SHACK
THAT LOOKED WARM AND SAFE.
HE WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY
IF HE'D KNOWN
WHO LIVED THERE.
MILO'S FUR WAS BEGINNING
TO DRY OFF.
HE WAS FEELING SAFE AT LAST,
UNTIL HE LOOKED AT
WHAT WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE.
OOOH.
"STAY CALM," MILO THOUGHT.
"IT'S ALL RIGHT
AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T--
OH, NO!"
MILO TRIED TO HIDE,
BUT THE BEAR SMELLED A CAT
RIGHT AWAY.
MILO KNEW SOMEHOW
HE WAS GOING TO
HAVE TO OUTSMART THIS BEAR.
"OK, TOUGH GUY.
COME AND GET ME!"
HE SHOUTED, DARTING BACK
INTO A DRAWER.
THE BEAR REACHED FOR MILO
WITH AN OPEN, HUNGRY MOUTH.
"NO, NO. UP HERE!"
MILO YELLED, "UP HERE!"
"COME ON. JUST REACH IN
AND GRAB ME.
TOO LATE!"
"HEY! DOWN HERE!"
"WANT TO COME IN?"
"I'LL HELP YOU.
I'LL PULL YOU IN BY YOUR NOSE.
WHICH DRAWER HAS THE CAT?"
"NOW, HERE'S A LITTLE HINT."
NOW THE BEAR WAS RAGING MAD.
HE'D HAD ENOUGH OF RUMMAGING
THROUGH DRAWERS AFTER A CAT.
NOW HE WAS GOING TO PULL
THE WHOLE SHACK APART.
SHEW! IT LOOKED BAD,
BUT MILO HAD ONE LAST PLAN.
HE JUMPED ON TOP
OF THE DRESSER.
THE BEAR CAME CLOSER.
MILO COULD FEEL THE TIPS
OF HIS CLAWS.
JUST WHEN THE BEAR
ALMOST HAD HIM...
"PERFECT SHOT!" MILO SAID,
FEELING PRETTY GOOD.
AND THE BEAR, KNOCKED SILLY,
STUMBLED OUT OF THE SHACK,
WONDERING WHAT HIT HIM.
MILO WAS AFRAID THE BEAR
WOULD BE BACK.
HE THOUGHT HE'D BE
A LOT SAFER HIDING
AT THE TOP OF A TREE,
BUT HE WAS WRONG AGAIN.
CLIMBING OUT OF THE PIT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
MILO CALLED FOR HELP, EVEN
THOUGH HE KNEW IT WAS USELESS.
NOBODY WOULD HEAR HIM
OUT HERE.
[MEOW MEOW]
BUT SOMEONE DID.
[RUFF RUFF]
[RUFF RUFF]
MILO COULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT HE SAW.
COULD IT REALLY BE OTIS?
"DON'T WORRY," OTIS BARKED,
"I'LL GET YOU OUT SOMEHOW."
"DID YOU TRY CLIMBING OUT?"
"IT'S TOO DEEP. SEE?"
MILO SAID.
"I HAVE AN IDEA," OTIS SAID.
"CLIMB IT!" OTIS BARKED.
"I THINK IT'S TOO SHORT."
"DON'T WORRY," OTIS BARKED.
"I'VE GOT ANOTHER IDEA."
"GRAB THE END," OTIS SHOUTED.
"WE DID IT!" OTIS YELLED,
OPENING HIS MOUTH BY MISTAKE.
"ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON!"
OTIS GROWLED,
MAKING SURE TO KEEP HIS TEETH
TIGHTLY CLENCHED.
"HA! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?"
OTIS ASKED.
"YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH--
BEARS, SNAKES, EVEN SEA GULLS."
BUT THAT WAS ALL BEHIND THEM.
NOW THEY WERE BURSTING
WITH JOY
BECAUSE FINALLY
THEY WERE BACK TOGETHER.
"LISTEN. WHAT WAS THAT?"
OTIS SAID.
THEY RAN TO THE CAT CRIES,
AND MILO WAS
SUDDENLY BREATHLESS.
"HELLO, I'M JOYCE."
JOYCE?
JOYCE!
JOYCE AND MILO SEEMED TO GET
FRIENDLIER AND FRIENDLIER.
OTIS HAD NEVER SEEN
SUCH RIDICULOUS BEHAVIOR.
NEVER.
"JOYCE, COME BACK WITH ME
TO MY FARM."
"I-I DON'T KNOW.
A FARM ISN'T EXACTLY
MY LIFESTYLE."
"OH, YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
MILO SAID.
"THEY'LL ALL LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU."
JOYCE FINALLY SAID YES,
AND THREE TRAVELERS BEGAN
THE JOURNEY BACK TO THE FARM.
MILO HAD A PLAN.
THEY WOULD FIND THE RIVER
THAT CARRIED HIM AWAY
AND FOLLOW IT BACK HOME.
JOYCE KNEW WHERE A RIVER FLOWED
THROUGH THESE WOODS,
SO SHE LED THE WAY
WITH MILO BY HER SIDE
AND OTIS TRAILING BEHIND.
"ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING?" OTIS SAID.
"I DON'T SEE ANY RIVERS
AROUND HERE."
"TRUST ME," SAID JOYCE.
OTIS JUST GROWLED.
"COME ON, OTIS,"
MILO CALLED OUT.
"WE WANT TO MAKE IT HOME
BEFORE WINTER.
OTIS, WHERE ARE YOU?"
MILO SHOUTED.
"HAVE YOU KNOWN HIM LONG?"
JOYCE ASKED.
FINALLY, JUST AS JOYCE SAID,
THEY CAME TO A RIVER.
"I HOPE IT'S THE RIGHT ONE,"
MILO SAID.
THEY FOLLOWED IT UPSTREAM HOPING
TO SEE SOMETHING FAMILIAR.
"YES. THIS IS THE RIGHT RIVER!"
MILO CRIED OUT.
"I'LL NEVER FORGET
THOSE WATERFALLS.
I TOLD YOU SHE'D DO IT.
OTIS! OTIS!"
OTIS WAS FEELING
PRETTY ROTTEN
ABOUT THE WAY
THE TRIP WAS GOING.
MILO WAS ALWAYS WITH JOYCE
AND HARDLY PAID
ANY ATTENTION TO HIM.
SO OTIS MADE A DECISION.
"YOU TWO, FOLLOW THE RIVER.
"I'M...I'M GOING
OVER THE MOUNTAINS...
BY MYSELF."
"DON'T BE A FOOL, OTIS.
STAY WITH US."
"I'D RATHER GO ALONE."
"HEY! WHERE
ARE YOU GOING, OTIS?"
BUT HE DIDN'T ANSWER.
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK BACK.
OTIS WAS ONLY GONE
A FEW DAYS
WHEN THE FIRST SNOWSTORM
INTERRUPTED THE JOURNEY.
TRAVELING THROUGH THE SNOW
WOULD BE TOO DANGEROUS.
MILO AND JOYCE KNEW
THEY'D HAVE TO
FIND SHELTER IN THE WOODS
AND WAIT UNTIL SPRING.
THEY TOOK A COZY WINTER HOME
IN A TREE TRUNK...
WHILE OTIS TRUDGED
THROUGH THE SNOW,
CONTINUING ON HIS WAY.
THAT AFTERNOON THE WINTER SUN
WAS WARM ENOUGH
TO MELT THE SNOW,
AND IT CAME TUMBLING DOWN
FROM THE TREES.
OTIS WAS ALL RIGHT,
BUT HE WAS SURE HE HEARD
A CALL FOR HELP
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE.
[BARK BARK]
OTIS FOUGHT HIS WAY
THROUGH THE SNOW,
HEADING TOWARDS THE VOICE
IN THE WOODS.
[WHIMPERING]
"WHERE ARE YOU?"
OTIS HOLLERED.
"OVER HERE,"
WHIMPERED A DOG'S VOICE.
"I CAN'T DIG OUT.
IT'S SOLID ICE."
AT FIRST,
OTIS WAS EXASPERATED,
BUT THEN HE SAW...HER.
"I'M SONDRA," SHE SAID.
"WHO ARE YOU?"
"OTIS. I'VE NEVER MET
A DOG LIKE YOU, SANDRA."
"NO. SONDRA.
IT'S A FRENCH PRONUNCIATION."
SHE'S SMART, TOO.
AND OTIS,
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
IN HIS RATHER SERIOUS LIFE,
BEGAN ACTING VERY SILLY.
NOW OTIS BEGAN TOUNDERSTAND
WHAT HAD COME OVER MILO.
HE AND SONDRA KEPT ON
ROMPING THROUGH THE DRIFTS,
KICKING UP SNOW
AND DISTURBING
SOME OF THE MORE
PROPER NEIGHBORS.
SONDRA HAD BEEN SPENDING
THE WINTER
IN A SMALL
BUT COMFORTABLE CAVE.
SHE AND OTIS DECIDED
TO STAY THERE UNTIL SPRING.
AND THOUGH A CHILL WIND
WAS BLOWING OUTSIDE,
THE WINTER
SUDDENLY SEEMED WARMER.
SOME TIME LATER,
DURING THE LAST WEEKS
OF THE LONG WINTER,
JOYCE WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS.
THE TIME WAS DRAWING NEAR.
"YOU OK, JOYCE?" MILO ASKED.
"WANT SOME MORE DINNER?
REMEMBER, YOU'RE EATING
FOR EIGHT NOW."
"MILO. MILO,
I THINK IT'S TIME."
"OK," MILO SAID.
"REMEMBER THE WAY TO BREATHE?"
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
"I HOPE THAT TURNS OUT
TO BE A KITTEN," THOUGHT MILO.
"IT IS!
IT'S A LITTLE GIRL KITTEN!"
"AND SIX MORE TO COME, MILO.
MMM, YES."
THAT SAME DAY,
NOT TOO FAR AWAY,
OTIS WAS IN HIS CAVE
WITH SONDRA,
WHO WAS HEAVY WITH PUPPY.
"IS IT GOING TO BE SOON?"
"WELL, ANY MINUTE NOW, OTIS,"
SONDRA WHISPERED.
"OH!
"OH, IT'S OTIS, JR.!
"OH, HA HA!
IT'S OTIS, JR.!
"I'M A FATHER!
I'M A FATHER! OH!
IT'S A BOY!
IT'S A BOY!"
"OTIS, YOU RAN OUT
A LITTLE TOO SOON."
"IT'S A LITTER!
IT'S A LITTER!"
MILO WATCHED AS THE KITTENS
GOT BIGGER EVERY DAY.
AND THE PUPPIES GREW
EVEN FASTER.
"YOU KNOW," OTIS SAID,
"WE REALLY SHOULD THINK
OF NAMES FOR THEM."
"OH, I DID THAT ALREADY,"
SONDRA REPLIED.
"I GAVE THEM ALL
FRENCH NAMES.
"THIS ONE IS JEAN-PIERRE.
THAT'S FRANCOIS,
AND THAT'S SUZETTE."
AS THE KITTENS GREW,
MILO NOTICED
THAT ONE OF THEM
LOOKED JUST LIKE HIM!
"I'LL BET THAT ONE'S
GOING TO BE TROUBLE,"
MILO THOUGHT,
AND MILO STARTED REMEMBERING
WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE KITTEN
BACK ON THE FARM.
HE EVEN REMEMBERED THE DAY
HE MET OTIS.
BUT AS THE COLD WEATHER
DRAGGED ON,
OTIS AND SONDRA
FACED A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
THERE WAS
TOO MUCH WINTER LEFT
AND TOO LITTLE FOOD.
OTIS KNEW HE'D HAVE TO GO OUT
AND FIND SOME.
HE REMEMBERED A POND
WHERE HE'D SEEN A BEAR
SCOOP UP SOME FISH
THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ICE.
MAYBE HE'D BE LUCKY
AND FIND SOME FISH THERE.
BUT THE BITTER COLD WEATHER
HAD FROZEN OVER
THE FISHING HOLE,
AND THE FISH
WERE LOCKED IN SOLID ICE,
AND A BLAST
OF ICY WIND
SIGNALED THE START
OF A WINTER STORM.
IT LOOKED BAD FOR OTIS.
THE WIND WAS STINGING HIS FACE
LIKE NEEDLES.
HIS PAWS WERE NUMB
FROM THE COLD.
HE WAS BEATEN DOWN
BY THE STORM.
HE HAD TO REST.
ALMOST FROZEN,
OTIS LAY DOWN IN THE SNOW,
READY TO GIVE UP.
BUT THEN HE BEGAN THINKING
ABOUT SONDRA AND THE PUPPIES.
THEY WERE WAITING FOR HIM
BACK IN THE CAVE,
DEPENDING ON HIM.
WHAT--
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM
IF HE NEVER RETURNED?
AND OTIS
FELT HIS STRENGTH RENEWED.
HE FORCED HIMSELF
UP ON HIS PAWS,
KNOWING
HE HAD TO GO ON
FOR SONDRA,
FOR THE PUPPIES,
FOR DOGS EVERYWHERE.
THE STORM
FINALLY DIED DOWN,
BUT OTIS HAD NO IDEA
WHERE HE WAS.
THEN, IN THE DISTANCE,
HE SAW A SIGN OF HOPE.
HE BARKED LOUDLY
TO ANNOUNCE THAT THERE
WAS A HUNGRY DOG OUTSIDE,
AND A FAMILIAR FORM
APPEARED IN THE WINDOW.
"LOOK WHAT THE BLIZZARD
BLEW IN!" MILO SAID.
"HOW ABOUT SOME FISH?"
"OK. FOR MY PUPPIES."
"YOU HAVE PUPPIES?
ME, TOO."
"YOU HAVEWHAT?"
"I MEAN, UH, UH, KITTENS,"
MILO YELLED.
OTIS KNEW HIS FAMILY
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THESE FISH,
BUT HOW WOULD HE
REACH THEM?
MILO HAD IT
ALL WORKED OUT.
"HEY, OTIS."
"I'VE REALLY MISSED YOU."
SO, MILO AND OTIS
MADE AN AGREEMENT.
THEY'D MEET IN THE SPRING
WITH THEIR FAMILIES,
AND ALL TOGETHER,
THEY'D TRAVEL BACK TO THE FARM.
AND SPRING
WASN'T THAT FAR OFF.
ON THE FIRST WARM DAY,
JUST AS PLANNED,
MILO BROUGHT OUT
HIS NEW FAMILY,
AND THEY WAITED FOR OTIS.
OTIS WAS HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE
GETTING
HIS PUPPIES ORGANIZED.
AND ON
THIS GLORIOUS SPRING DAY,
ALL THE ANIMALS
ALL AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE
WERE BRINGING THEIR YOUNG
OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE.
THE FOX
NOW HAD A CUB,
AND SO, OF COURSE,
DID THE RACOON,
AND THE DEER WAS TEACHING
HER FAWN TO FROLIC.
AND MILO AND JOYCE
HAD THEIR KITTENS.
FINALLY, OTIS ARRIVED,
AND THE TWO FAMILIES
SAW EACH OTHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
AT FIRST,
THEY WERE A LITTLE SHY.
BUT THEN,
OTIS LED THE CHARGE,
AND THE PUPPIES
RAN TOWARDS THE KITTENS,
EAGER TO MEET
THE FAMILY OF CATS
THEY'D HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT.
"THIS IS YOUR UNCLE MILO,"
OTIS SAID.
"THE ONE YOU PULLED OUT
OF THE PIT?" FRANCOIS ASKED.
ALL THE PUPPIES AND KITTENS
BEGAN TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
"YOU'RE A STRANGE-LOOKING DOG,"
SUZETTE SAID TO MILO, JR.
"YOU'RE DOGS, WE'RE CATS,"
HE REPLIED.
THEN OTIS BARKED.
"HEY! HEY! HEY!
"ALL RIGHT.
EVERYONE, QUIET.
QUIET."
AND AFTER THE WHOLE GROUP
WAS GATHERED TOGETHER,
MILO AND OTIS
LED THE WAY DOWN THE ROAD,
THE ROAD THAT WOULD
TAKE THEM TO THE PLACE
WHERE THEIR LIVES
HAD BEGUN,
THE ROAD
THAT WOULD TAKE THEM...
HOME.
