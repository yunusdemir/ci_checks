This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago,
he touched off the scandal
that nearly
crippled this company,
claiming that his
Good Guy doll, Chucky,
was possessed by
Charles Lee Ray,
the notorious
Lakeshore Strangler.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Now I ask you,
ladies and gentlemen,
after all the lawsuits
and negative publicity,
when the company is finally
getting back on its feet again,
where is the wisdom in putting
the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan,
before any of this happened,
the Good Guy outsold
all our other toys 2-to-1.
Even now, interest in the
market place is at its peak.
The factory is up
and running again.
We should be in
stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies
of one disturbed boy
influence company policy.
Well, what if
the doll somehow affects
another child in
a negative way?
You could have a public
relations nightmare on your hands.
You know, one of the hardest
things about this business
is that
it is a business.
It doesn't matter
what we're selling.
Whether it's cars, nuclear
weapons, or, yes, even toys.
The bottom line
is the bottom line.
And what are children, after
all, but consumer trainees?
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Andy Barclay is
ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
WOMAN: Okay.
MAN: All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
If there's nothing I
can say to convince you,
then I must go on record
with my position.
I'm completely
against this.
Your position is
crystal clear, Miles,
and you can be sure
I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks!
Please.
Mr. Sullivan, we have
a little surprise for you.
The guys at the factory
sent this over.
And we all wanted you
to have it.
It's the first one
off the assembly line.
The Good Guy
of the '90s!
(ALL CHEERING)
Well, if there's nothing
else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
PETZOLD: It's just,
my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
Well, I guess I could review
the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night,
Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.

Well, despite a downdraft
in the bond market,
stocks were able to
post a rally on Friday,
thanks to a couple
of different factors.
Not only did the
stronger-than-expected employment report
allay some
recession fears,
but also there was a
technical rebound in stock,
short covering,
program buying,
and the resurgence
in the deal stocks
help set the tone
for rally on the Street.
Here's a look at
the numbers now.
For Friday, the Dow Industrial's
up sixteen and two-thirds.
Of the highs of the day,
the transportation average up
a little better than three.
Utilities bouncing up a point
to pass at 12, at 22, 61, 78.
S&P 500 Cash are
better than two
with the margin peaking up
almost two and a half
with the premier
ending at 1.59.
New York Stock Exchange
Index up 1.23,
volume backing off a bit
at 164 million shares.
Advances beat
declines just about
9- to-5 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
The up volume 103 million
shares, the down volume...

COCHRANE: I see that
for the past eight years
you've been in one
foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away
from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
I meant how come you never
got settled anywhere?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable
with those people.
They weren't family,
they were strangers.
All right,
listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack
because you've had it so rough,
but you're a troublemaker.
And I got a real problem
with troublemakers.
They don't fit
into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up,
you're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these
fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.

I thought as a child.
"But when I became a man,
I put away childish things. "

Thank you. I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise you'd know they don't
tolerate any form of individuality here.
Certainly nothing so
personal as the first name.
Yeah, right, I forgot.

So, who's this Shelton?

He's God around here.
Don't expect any

Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and

Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're the new boy, huh?

You are without a doubt
the most pathetic thing
I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question,
nimrod!
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me,
you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
What did you say?
I said,
"You asshole," sir!
You think you're pretty
funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Why don't you drop
and give me 25 right now?
Twenty-five what, sir?
Twenty-five push-ups,
De Silva.
One, sir. Two, sir...
Now, you women
might think that
because you're
so much more delicate,
you deserve some
sort of special treatment,
and once a month we're just
going to get on out of your way.
DE SILVA: Twelve, sir. Thirteen, sir.
Well, you can forget it.
The same rules
apply for everybody.

Sorry. Nothing from your

He'll write to you

Hey!
I got a job for you.
Would you give this to the

Yes, sir.

how could you be so stupid?
Hey, look out!

Who the fuck are you?
I thought you guys
only said three sentences.
I'm new and improved.
I never saw

Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to
get this package.
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body,
and I ain't told anyone
about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler. What's yours?
Chucky. But, uh,
my real name is
Charles Lee Ray.
(GUNS FIRING)
Whitehurst,
what am I doing wrong?
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
Is there anything
you can't do?
Yeah. I can't seem to get

Hi.
Hi.
So, want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
(SIGHS)
No. Put the elbow...
Yeah, like that.
And like this.
No. Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights

Now hold your breath.

You're not concentrating.
You know, it was really great what
you did for us back there at formation.
Well,

TYLER: Couldn't we just
play hide-and-seek?

and we're gonna need
the Springfield 0-3s...
Yes, sir.
...marked for both the
red team and the blue team.
What are you doing,
Tyler?
We're playing
Hide the Soul.
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading
the paint pellet.
We don't play with dolls,
do we now, Tyler?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is

Tyler, you know better than to
talk back to a superior officer.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.
I'll be back!

(SCOFFS)
Does this look like
a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle!
Major Ellis?
Sir!
Would you please show the
new boy the difference?
This is my rifle,
this is my gun.
This is for shooting,
and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle
is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
CHUCKY: Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
Jesus!

I'm stuck! Mister!
I'm in here!

You get back there.
Better finish unpacking,

Shelton's notorious
for surprise inspections.
What are you doing?
What does it look like? I'm
polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you
polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of
the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see
Cochrane with that doll today?
No. What doll?
He was carrying
a Good Guy doll,
just before the accident
with the garbage truck.
Good Guys,
I remember those.
Yeah, me, too.

Uh, lights out

I'm going to

Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would've
sent me a package?
(GROANS)
Hey,

No, you're dead.
We killed you!
You know what they say,
you just can't keep
a Good Guy down.

Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me. You need me.
You need to transfer
your soul into my body.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some
fresh meat lined up
and I'm not gonna let you
spoil it, not this time.
(GASPS) Tyler.
Yeah, just think.
Chucky's gonna be a bro.

Just give me back
the doll.
No, no,
you listen to me.
You tell Whitehurst
he's off the hook, huh?
I got myself
another slave.
And clean up this mess.

Where's the fucking doll?
You took it, didn't you? No!
What's going on?
Yeah, well, somebody
sure as hell took it.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
It's almost midnight,
Colonel.
Is this really necessary?
I'm trying to
weed out a thief, sir.
You've always told me
how important it is
to uphold the school's
code of honor.
I'm simply trying to impress
that upon the men, sir.
All right, Shelton,
make your point.
But I want everybody
back inside at 0100 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay,
he's going to be living in
a whole world full of shit.
All right. We've only got an
hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.

Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I gotta talk to
you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low
till he knows you're alone,
and then he's
gonna come after you.
He just wants to play.
Listen to me, Tyler.
No matter what he says, no
matter what he promises you,
you've got to
stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad.
He's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me,
he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot
of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane
was one of them.
You're just jealous 'cause he's my
best friend now, instead of yours.
(VIDEO GAME BEEPING)
Look, you better keep this.

Whitehurst,
you are without a doubt

to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not

Why don't you do
yourself a favor
and get the hell
out of Kent?
If I had any choice in
the matter, I would, sir.
Smart-ass.
Presto! You're bald.
(CHUCKLES)
(SNIFFLES) Yeah.
(WHISTLING TUNE)
What the hell?
How did you get

It's definitely you.
I just forgot my... My...

The annual war games
have been an unbroken tradition
here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who
believed in the value of tradition.
He not only would have
wanted us to go on,
he'd have
ordered us to go on.
Therefore, the war games
will proceed as scheduled.
(ALL YELLING)

The objective is simple.

You will pick up your weapons

You will be using the

What's going on,
Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't
you? You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out
on me now, Whitehurst.
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see
anything, okay?
I didn't see
anything at all.

Ellis, let's make sure
the perimeters are secured.
Yes, sir.
She checks
all the windows,
and then the babysitter
hears this thump, thump.
Thumping.
Like something's being dragged
across the floor upstairs.
And suddenly she thinks, "I
haven't checked on the children. "
So she hurries to
the top of the stairs,
and when she gets there,
she sees her boyfriend,
completely dismembered,
dragging himself across
the floor by his chin.
Thump. Slide.
Thump. Slide.
CADET 1: Ugh!
(CADET 2 LAUGHS)
Thump. Slide.
IVERS: That is gross.
(DE SILVA LAUGHING)
Hey, you guys, I got a
better story and it's true.
It's about this
mental institution,
and it's a few miles
away from here.
Hey!
Hope it wasn't
something I said.
(CHUCKLES)
No. I'm sorry.
De Silva, where do you think
the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find them.
He always does.
By the way,
you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Oh.
Come on, Andy, I want
to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
BARCLAY: I almost forgot
there were places like that.
People just go
to have fun.
(TWIGS CRACKLING)
Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a
chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you,
does it?
No.
Man, I really gotta
get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find them.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this
from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance
mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team
is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck,
Whitehurst.
Now, are you
with me or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
ELLIS: Up and at 'em,
ladies, we're moving out!
I want this camp to be a
ghost town in five minutes!
I thought we weren't
going until dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance
map out of the Colonel's tent,
so we're
making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
Whitehurst.
You wouldn't know anything
about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you'd better
have a look in here, sir.
(SIGHS)
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
(SCOFFS)
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's
doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with
some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst,
where is he?
SHELTON:
Platoon, halt!
All right. De Silva, you're
going to take the right flank.
Siegel, you take the left.
I want you to check in
on the radio
every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are
gonna spread out
and meet up with Ellis
at Split Rock.
Move out!
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for
coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck.
That was a close one.
Now, we can play
Hide the Soul.
I'm tired. I don't want to
play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fucking drag,
you know that?
Watch your mouth,
Charles.
Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier
is always prepared, Tyler.
Barclay was right.
You're not a Good Guy.
(CHUCKLES) Sorry, kid,
you got me. I'm bad.
Now,
assume the position.
TYLER: No!
(CHUCKY GROANS)
Get back here!
Barclay! Barclay!
Tyler!
(TWIG SNAPS)
Barclay, you fucking
traitor, give me my map!
Listen to me, Shelton!
You got any idea what we
do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Come on, Whitehurst,
back me up.
Major Ellis,
call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel,
do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
ELLIS ON RADIO:
De Silva, come in.
(SCREAMING)
Siegel's on
his way back, sir.
No word yet
from De Silva.
Well, keep trying.
Yes, sir.
TYLER: Help! Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Well, looks like we got
ourselves a little POW.
Barclay, you were right.
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
CHUCKY ON RADIO: Come
in, Barclay. Come in.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
CHUCKY:
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
ELLIS: It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
CHUCKY:
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old jeep
or there'll be hell to pay.
DE SILVA: Andy, don't do it! De Silva!
You hear that,
Barclay?
BARCLAY: Don't touch
her, you son of a bitch.
Now, bring me the kid
or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
Come in, red team.
CADET:
This is red team. Over.
CHUCKY: We got a situation
up here at the old jeep.
Blue team sighted. Advise
you to move your troops in.
CHUCKY: I hope they like
the taste of lead.
Now just sit back
and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are going
to go on up ahead, draw 'em out.
The rest of us are
gonna circle around.
Shelton,
this is no game.
I'm telling you,
this guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay.
It's only paint.
All right.
Let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me, too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No.
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all
of you to pieces!
Beat it.
Now, just get down
and shut up.
Yeah.
(GUNS FIRING)
Ow!
Hold your fire!
CADET: Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell
is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
(LAUGHING)
Fuck me.
(GUNS FIRING)
All right!
(LAUGHING)
Shit!
Stay down!
(GUNS FIRING)
They're using
live rounds!
(CACKLING)
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not
breathing. Get away from him!
You did this,
didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch!
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Stop it!
Get off of him!
He didn't do it!
Stop it!
Let go of me.
Stop it!
Sayonara, suckers.
DE SILVA:
No! Get off of him!
Stop it!
He didn't do it!
BARCLAY: Let go of me. DE
SILVA: He didn't do it! Stop!
Look out!
(EXPLOSION)
IVERS: No! Oh, my God, what happened?
It's Whitehurst.
GIRL: Oh, my God! Ellis!
Ellis, what happened?
Epstein,
what the hell happened?
I don't know. Who
fucked with the rifles?
EPSTEIN: I don't know.
ELLIS: Okay, okay.
Get Clark on the radio.
Yes, sir.
And get me a medic up
here right now! Yes, sir.
All right.
Everybody stay calm!
(SOBBING)
Epstein, I want
that radio! Oh, God.

last time I'm gonna tell you.
Give that thing a rest or
you're out of here, both of you.
Come on, we're not
bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Keep it down.
(MUSIC STOPS)
GIRL: Jeez!
Mister, mister,
you've got to help me.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Charles!
Charles, he's after me.
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
He wants to play Hide the Soul.
Okay, slow down, slow down!
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
Yes, sir.
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first-class, sir.
Have a seat.
How about some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt when a
friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend...
What's his name, Charles?
I bet you
Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you
he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's going
to hurt you.
Hey, I know what
will cheer you up.
Look what I found.
MAN: Here's your prize.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go in
the Super Loop.
CHILDREN: Yeah.
Hey, maybe
somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Mommy, Mommy,
I loved it!
Were you scared?
BOTH: No!
Let's have some popcorn
and go on one more ride.

Perfect. In there.
Don't even think
about it.
Come on.
Okay.
