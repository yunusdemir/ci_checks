COME ON, BOY!
MR. BOBSTER.
HOW PLEASANT TO SEE YOU.
HERE WE ARE, MR. BOBSTER.
YOUR FAVORITE.
AAH!
AAH!
MR. BOBSTER,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?
OH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
<i>IT WAS A COLD, SNOWY DAY
IN EARLY DECEMBER.</i>
<i>LACK OF FUNDS.</i>
<i>HAD FORCED MY OLD SCHOOL
TO CLOSE.</i>
<i>I WAS BEING SENT TO A NEW ONE,</i>
<i>IN THE MIDDLE OF TERM.</i>
<i>I WAS ACCUSTOMED.</i>
<i>TO THE OPEN, RELAXED EXPANSE.</i>
<i>OF THE COUNTRY.</i>
<i>NOW I WAS IN
THE HEART OF LONDON,</i>
<i>AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE VICTORIAN ERA.</i>
<i>THE STREETS WERE TEEMING.</i>
<i>WITH EVERY ACTMTY IMAGINABLE.</i>
<i>I WAS VERY TAKEN BY WHAT I SAW.</i>
<i>AS I STEPPED
THROUGH MY CARRIAGE,</i>
<i>THE SIGHT OF MY NEW SCHOOL.</i>
<i>FILLED ME WITH FEAR
AND APPREHENSION.</i>
<i>YET, I WAS SWEPT
WITH A WAVE OF CURIOSITY.</i>
<i>HOWEVER,
NOTHING COULD PREPARE ME.</i>
<i>FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY
ADVENTURE THAT LAY AHEAD.</i>
<i>OR THE EXTRAORDINARY INDMDUAL.</i>
<i>WHO WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE.</i>
THERE YOU ARE, SIR.
STOP!
ISN"'T IT VALUABLE?
WHAT"'S MORE IMPORTANT,
ITS VALUE OR MY SANITY?
I SHOULD"'VE MASTERED
THE DAMN THING BY NOW.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PLAYING?
THREE DAYS.
WELL,
 PERHAPS YOU
SHOULD
 BE PATIENT.
YOU"'RE THE NEW BOY.
YES, I TRANSFERRED
FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL.
MY NAME"'S... WAIT!
LET ME.
YOUR NAME IS JAMES WATSON
FROM THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.
YOUR FATHER IS A DOCTOR.
YOU SPEND
 A
CONSIDERABLE
 AMOUNT
OF LEISURE TIME WRITING.
AND YOU HAVE
 A
PARTICULAR
 FONDNESS
FOR CUSTARD TARTS.
AM I CORRECT?
MY NAME ISN"'T JAMES,
IT"'S JOHN.
OH, JAMES, JOHN,
WHAT"'S THE DIFFERENCE?
A GREAT DEAL.
OH, VERY WELL, SO...
YOUR NAME IS JOHN.
HOW DID I DO ON THE OTHERS?
YOU WERE CORRECT...
ON EVERY COUNT.
HOW IS IT DONE?
IS IT SOME SORT OF MAGIC TRICK?
NO MAGIC, WATSON.
PURE AND SIMPLE DEDUCTION.
THE NAME TAG ON YOUR MATTRESS
READS J. WATSON.
I SELECTED THE MOST COMMON NAME
THAT BEGINS WITH "J."
JAMES, OR JOHN...
 THAT WOULD
BE
 MY SECOND CHOICE.
OF COURSE.
YOUR STYLE OF SHOES
ARE NOT MADE IN THE CITY.
I"'VE ONLY ENCOUNTERED
THEM ONCE BEFORE
DURING A VISIT
TO NORTH ENGLAND.
THE MIDDLE FINGER
OF YOUR LEFT HAND
HAS A CALLUS,
A WRITER"'S TRADEMARK.
AND YOU WERE CARRYING
THE <i>HUNTER"'S
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DISEASE,</i>
A HANDBOOK NOT AVAILABLE
TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC,
ONLY TO PRACTICING PHYSICIANS.
SINCE SOMEONE OF YOUR AGE
OBVIOUSLY HASN"'T BEEN
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,
I CONCLUDED THAT
IT WAS GIVEN TO YOU
BY AN OLDER PERSON...
SOMEONE VERY DEAR TO YOU
WHO WAS CONCERNED
FOR YOUR HEALTH...
YOUR FATHER, THE DOCTOR.
AND THE CUSTARD TARTS?
SIMPLE!
THERE"'S A DISTINCT STAIN
OF YELLOW CUSTARD
ON YOUR LAPEL.
THAT PARTICULAR
COLOR OF CUSTARD
IS USED IN MAKING
CUSTARD TARTS.
WELL, YOUR SHAPE CONVINCED ME
THAT YOU"'VE EATEN
MANY OF THEM BEFORE.
THERE"'S NO NEED TO BE RUDE.
COME. WE HAVEN"'T GOT ALL DAY.
WHY? WHERE ARE WE GOING?
YOU WOULDN"'T WANT
TO MISS CHEMISTRY CLASS,
WOULD YOU?
BY THE WAY, WHAT"'S YOUR NAME?
HOLMES.
SHERLOCK HOLMES.
THE DEDUCTIVE MIND
NEVER RESTS, WATSON.
IT"'S NOT UNLIKE
 A FINELY
TUNED
 MUSICAL INSTRUMENT,
IT DEMANDS ATTENTION, PRACTICE.
HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT
FINE TUNING A MIND?
PROBLEMS OF LOGIC,
MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS,
RIDDLES.
FOR EXAMPLE, WATSON...
YOU"'RE SEATED IN A ROOM
WITH AN OLD SOUTHERN VIEW.
SUDDENLY, A BEAR WALKS
BY THE WINDOW.
WHAT COLOR IS THE BEAR?
RED!
THE BEAR IS RED.
WELL, HOW COULD
THE BEAR BE RED?
THE SOUTHERN SUN IS VERY HOT.
THE BEAR WOULD BE BURNED.
HA HA!
 THAT IS THE
MOST
 ABSURD ANSWER
I"'VE EVER HEARD.
TO SUCCESSFULLY
CONCLUDE THE E-EXPERIMENT,
UH... THE E-E-EXPERIMENT,
E-E-E-EXPERIMENT...
TO... TO REITERATE,
EXPERIMENT 14.
TH-TH-THROW A SMALL
PIECE OF POTASSIUM
ONTO SOME WA-T-TER.
LI-LIQUID WILL BE
RAPIDLY DECOM-COMPOSED,
AND SO VIOLENT
WILL BE THE ACTION,
THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF LIGHT...
THANK YOU.
HE"'S PARTICULARLY
BORING TODAY.
THE REDUCTION OF POTASSI...
UH, UH, OF POTASSI...
WHICH WILL BE DISSOLVED...
THAT WAS A GIRL.
BRILLIANT DEDUCTION, WATSON.
WHO IS SHE?
 WHAT"'S SHE
DOING
 IN A BOY"'S SCHOOL?
HER NAME"'S ELIZABETH.
FOLLOWING THE DEATH
 OF HER
PARENTS
 A FEW YEARS AGO,
SHE CAME TO LIVE
 ON SCHOOL
GROUNDS
 WITH HER UNCLE.
A RETIRED BROMPTON
SCHOOLMASTER.
AND S-S-SUCH
 IS
M-MODIFIED
 BY ST-ST...
ELIZABETH WAS
 JUST
ADMIRING
 MY NEW TIMEPIECE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE?
HMM... VERY INTERESTING.
ALL STYLISH GENTLEMEN
ARE WEARING THEM.
EXPENSIVE?
I BOUGHT IT IN BOND STREET.
I FIND THAT HIGHLY UNLIKELY.
I BEG YOUR PARDON!
HAD YOU TAKEN
 A MOMENT
TO EXAMINE
 THE FACE,
YOU"'D HAVE DISCOVERED
IT"'S FRENCH.
YET ACCORDING
TO THIS INSCRIPTION,
THE EXTERIOR
 WAS
MANUFACTURED
 IN SWITZERLAND.
YES, MY SUSPICION WAS CORRECT.
THE WORKS ARE
 OBVIOUSLY
ITALIAN
 IN ORIGIN.
CONGRATULATIONS, DUDLEY.
YOUR STYLISH TIMEPIECE
IS A FRAUD.
KEEP YOUR OPINIONS
TO YOURSELF, HOLMES.
I LOOK FORWARD
TO RESUMING OUR CONVERSATION...
WHEN THERE"'S A LITTLE
MORE PRIVACY.
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
DUDLEY"'S A POMPOUS ASS.
HE"'S VERY SWEET.
OH, REALLY?
IS THAT WHY
 YOU WERE
STANDING
 CLOSE TO HIM,
FLIRTING WITH HIM,
LETTING HIM DRIBBLE
ALL OVER YOUR HAND?
DO I DETECT
A SENSE OF JEALOUSY?
SHERLOCK HOLMES, JEALOUS?
MY DEAR,
 THAT WORD DOES
NOT
 ENTER MY VOCABULARY.
NEITHER DOES PUNCTUALITY.
OH, I SEE.
YOU"'RE ANGRY
BECAUSE I"'M LATE.
AS USUAL.
[JINGLING]
I"'M SORRY, BUT I CAN EXPLAIN.
YOU HAD SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT.
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
I WAS...
FORGIVE ME.
[THUD]
ELIZABETH,
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY NEW FRIEND...
THE HONORABLE,
BUT CLUMSY WATSON.
THE, UH, LADDER"'S
A BIT WOBBLY.
HELLO.
[JINGLING]
ELIZABETH!
HOLMES!
I THINK I"'VE SOLVED
ALL OF THE PROBLEMS!
WHO"'S THAT?
MY UNCLE.
RUPERT T. WAXFLATTER,
RETIRED SCHOOLMASTER.
DEGREES IN CHEMISTRY
AND BIOLOGY,
WELL-VERSED IN
PHILOSOPHY, MATHEMATICS,
AND PHYSICS.
AUTHOR OF 27 BOOKS.
INCREDIBLE!
MOST PEOPLE THINK
HE"'S A LUNATIC.
WHY?
HA HA HA!
HA HA!
OH, MY GOD.
VERY HOPEFUL SIGN.
HMM...
VERY HOPEFUL.
LET ME SEE,
THAT MAKES SIX...
SIX FAILED ATTEMPTS!
NEVERTHELESS,
WE SHALL NOT BE DEFEATED.
WE SHALL CONQUER.
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND.
THE CONCEPT OF FLIGHT
IS WELL WITHIN MY GRASP.
HE"'S DONE THIS SIX TIMES?
I LIVE HERE WITH UNCLE.
AFTER HE RETIRED,
THE SCHOOL GAVE HIM THE ATTIC
AS A WORK PLACE.
IT"'S INCREDIBLE!
I"'VE SPENT MANY
HAPPY HOURS HERE.
HE"'S TAUGHT ME MORE
THAN 10 SCHOOLMASTERS
PUT TOGETHER.
[ARF]
UNCAS, SAY HELLO TO WATSON.
SAY HELLO, UNCAS.
SAY HELLO.
WATSON, HE"'S NOT A PARROT.
FOUND THE WEAKNESS, SIR?
I CONSTRUCTED THE WINGS
OUT OF AN INFERIOR MATERIAL.
I SHALL HAVE TO REBUILD
THE ENTIRE MACHINE.
THE ENTIRE MACHINE?
WON"'T THAT BE DIFFICULT?
ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR HOLMES,
ELEMENTARY.
[KNOCK ON WINDOW]
[ARF]
OH.
YOU"'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!
I"'VE GOT IT, HOLMES.
THE BEAR IS BLACK.
WHAT"'S THAT, OLD CHAP?
THE BEAR IN THE RIDDLE.
IT"'S A BLACK BEAR.
WRONG AGAIN, WATSON.
I"'D APPRECIATE IT
 IF YOU
WOULDN"'T
 DISTURB ME
WHEN I"'M TRYING
 TO
CONCENTRATE
 ON THE LESSON.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, BENSON?
I THINK I"'VE SPRAINED
MY ANKLE, SIR.
MRS. DRIBB, WILL YOU
ATTEND TO HIM?
GENTLEMEN, WE CANNOT
PERMIT OURSELVES
LAPSES IN CONCENTRATION.
WE MUST WORK ON TECHNIQUE,
RHYTHM, AND ON BALANCE.
NO BETTER PUPIL
 TO HELP ME
ILLUSTRATE
 PROPER FORM AND TECHNIQUE
THAN HOLMES.
STUDY OUR STANCE,
OUR MOVEMENTS,
AND OUR STYLE.
EN GARDE.
TOUCHE.
TOUCHE.
MY GAME, HOLMES.
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
MR. HOLMES LOST
BECAUSE OF ONE
IMPORTANT FACTOR...
HIS EMOTIONS TOOK OVER.
HE IGNORED DISCIPLINE.
NEVER REPLACE DISCIPLINE
WITH EMOTION.
WELL PLAYED, HOLMES.
<i>PER CHRISTUM DOMINUM NOSTRUM,</i>
AMEN.
AMEN. AMEN.
I WANT TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY...
A GENERAL.
GENERALS DON"'T
MAKE ANY MONEY.
I WOULD LIKE TO BE AN AUTHOR.
AUTHORS DON"'T MAKE MONEY.
I WANT TO BE A BARRISTER.
BARRISTERS MAKE MONEY.
I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR.
NOBODY ASKED YOU.
SORRY.
HOLMES, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU
 WANT TO
BE
 WHEN YOU GROW UP?
I NEVER WANT TO BE ALONE.
[JINGLING]
[WHIMPERS]
[JINGLING]
[WHIMPERS]
UNCAS!
[ARF ARF]
UNCAS!
UNCAS!
UNCAS,
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
YOU LEFT ME ALL ALONE.
[JINGLING]
[JINGLING]
[JINGLING]
HELLO. IS ANYBODY THERE?
AAH.
HELP!
AAH! AAH!
AAH!
GET OUT OF THE WAY!
HOLMES IS GOING
TO SOLVE THE CRIME!
HOLMES IS GOING
TO SOLVE THE CRIME.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HOLMES IS GOING
TO SOLVE THE CRIME.
<i>IT WAS THE BEGINNING
OF MY SECOND WEEK.</i>
<i>AT BROMPTON.</i>
<i>WITH EACH PASSING DAY,</i>
<i>MY FASCINATION
WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES.</i>
<i>AND HIS WORLD.</i>
<i>CONTINUED TO GROW.</i>
<i>ON THIS OCCASION,</i>
<i>THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
WAS BURSTING WITH EXCITEMENT.</i>
<i>DUDLEY HAD CHALLENGED HOMES.</i>
<i>TO A TEST OF INGENUITY,</i>
<i>SKILL, AND PERCEPTION.</i>
<i>"DUDLEY HAD SNATCHED
THE SCHOOL"'S FENCING TROPHY.</i>
<i>AND HIDDEN IT
IN A SECRET PLACE.</i>
<i>HE GAVE HOLMES 60 MINUTES.</i>
<i>TO FIND THE TROPHY.</i>
<i>HOLMES ACCEPTED
THE CHALLENGE WITH CONFIDENCE.</i>
THE GAME IS AFOOT!
HOORAY!
GOOD LUCK, HOLMES!
GOOD LUCK!
THIS IS TRULY DESPICABLE.
IMAGINE A CULTURED
 STUDENT
ACTING LIKE
 A CHIMPANZEE.
OH, HE"'S JUST HAVING
A BIT OF FUN.
I"'M SURE THAT YOU
 CAN STILL
REMEMBER
 WHAT FUN WAS.
BESIDES, THIS HOLMES BOY
IS TOO PRECOCIOUS,
TOO EGOTISTICAL
FOR HIS OWN GOOD.
HA HA HA!
HE"'LL NEVER FIND THAT TROPHY.
I"'LL WAGER A GUINEA HE DOES.
DONE.
AAH!
OH!
EXCUSE ME.
HOLMES, YOU"'VE ONLY GOT
ONE MINUTE.
HOLMES...
YOU"'VE ONLY GOT ONE MINUTE.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME.
I"'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE.
[CLOCK CHIMES]
ONLY SECONDS LEFT, HOLMES.
I ASSUME YOU"'RE GMNG UP.
NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING,
MY GOOD FELLOW.
HOLMES,
 I SEE NO
SIGN
 OF A TROPHY.
BUT I DO.
STOP!
HAVE YOU GONE MAD?
THIS IS ANTIQUE!
<i>IT WAS A WONDERFUL,
HEROIC MOMENT FOR HOLMES.</i>
<i>BUT LITTLE COULD HE KNOW.</i>
<i>THAT HIS AMAZING POWERS
AND TALENTS.</i>
<i>WOULD SOON BE PUT
TO A MUCH GREATER TEST...</i>
<i>A TEST OF TERRIFYING
AND DEADLY PROPORTIONS.</i>
I CAME
 THROUGH THE
SKYLIGHT
 IN THE KITCHEN.
ANYWAY, IT WAS THEN
THAT I NOTICED
THE PARTICLES
BENEATH THE OVEN...
PARTICLES
 OF FRESHLY
BAKED
 CERAMIC.
QUITE ODD FOR A KITCHEN
USED TO PREPARE STUDENT MEALS.
SO THE CLUE...
RED AND GREEN PAINT, CERAMIC.
AS I PONDERED THE QUESTION,
I KICKED
 THE REMAINING
SNOW
 FROM MY SHOE.
AS THE SNOW CRUMBLED,
MY SHOE WAS REVEALED.
THE IMAGE STRUCK A CHORD.
YOU HEARD MUSIC?
WATSON, YOU"'RE A FOOL!
I"'M TALKING ABOUT
A PARALLEL... A PARALLEL
BETWEEN MY FOOT ENCASED IN SNOW
AND THE TROPHY
ENCASED IN CERAMIC...
A JAR, A VASE.
PAINTED WITH RED
AND GREEN PAINT.
EXACTLY, WATSON!
HOLMES!
HOLMES!
THIS TIME,
 I"'VE DEFINITELY
SOLVED THE PROBLEM!
HE"'S GOING TO FLY AGAIN.
TA-TA.
MR. LESTRADE?
HOLMES.
OH.
IT"'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
THREE, FOUR DAYS
SINCE YOUR LAST VISIT?
THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.
THERE ARE NO
 MURDER
REPORTS
 FOR YOU TO STUDY,
NO CASEBOOKS
YOU HAVEN"'T READ.
I"'M NOT HERE FOR RESEARCH.
I BELIEVE I"'M ONTO SOMETHING.
OH, NOT AGAIN!
THIS TIME I"'M CERTAIN OF IT.
REALLY. JUST LIKE LAST MONTH,
WHEN YOU WERE CONVINCED
THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR
EMBEZZLED ££300,000
FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND.
I WAS CLOSE.
IT WAS THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR.
OH, HOLMES, PLEASE.
I DON"'T HAVE TIME
FOR ANY MORE OF
YOUR PLAYPEN CRIMES.
JUST HAVE A QUICK LOOK
AT THESE.
A SUICIDE. A CARRIAGE ACCIDENT.
I SUSPECT FOUL PLAY.
WHY?
THE TWO INCIDENTS ARE
COMPLETELY UNRELATED.
WRONG. BOTH MEN GRADUATED
FROM THE SAME
UNIVERSITY IN 1809.
COINCIDENCE.
NEITHER DEATHS FIT
THEIR PERSONALITY.
ACCORDING TO THE PAPER,
BOBSTER WAS A HAPPY MAN.
CONTENT WITH LIFE,
CAREER, HIS FAMILY.
WHY WOULD HE COMMIT SUICIDE?
DIDN"'T EVEN LEAVE A NOTE!
AND REVEREND NESBITT
IS DESCRIBED BY FRIENDS
AS WARM, LOVING, PEACEFUL.
YET, THE CARRIAGE DRIVER
INSISTS
THAT HE WAS CRAZED, INSANE.
IN A STATE OF PANIC
 WHEN HE
RAN OUT
 INTO THE STREET.
A MERE FLUCTUATION OF CHARACTER
IS HARDLY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.
AND IF YOU WANT MY ADVICE,
YOU KEEP YOUR NOSE
OUT OF THE <i>TIMES.</i>
AND INTO YOUR SCHOOL BOOKS.
I APPRECIATE
 YOUR TIME,
 MR.
LESTRADE.
I SUGGEST YOU HOLD ON TO THESE.
IF I WERE A DETECTIVE,
TRAPPED IN HERE ALL DAY,
UP TO MY NECK
 IN
BORING
 PAPERWORK,
I"'D DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO SEEK OUT THAT ONE CASE...
THAT ONE INVESTIGATION...
THAT COULD
 PROMOTE
ME
 TO INSPECTOR.
GOOD DAY, HOLMES.
HOLMES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DUDLEY DROPPED THIS, SIR.
I"'M GMNG IT TO HIM.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
WHAT? YOUR PAPER.
IT DOESN"'T BELONG TO ME.
YOU DROPPED IT.
IT ISN"'T EVEN MY HANDWRITING.
L-L-LET ME!
THESE ARE THE EXAM ANSWERS.
WELL, HOLMES.
 IT APPEARS
WE HAVE
 FINALLY DISCOVERED
THE SECRET OF YOUR
INTELLIGENCE.
BUT, SIR...
YOU BETTER COME WITH ME.
FOOLS. THEIR AGE
 HAS
TURNED THEM
 TO GRANITE.
THEY REFUSE
 TO LISTEN TO
ANYONE
 BUT THEMSELVES.
I WAS CERTAIN THEY WOULD TAKE
MY RECORD INTO CONSIDERATION.
THEY DID.
UNFORTUNATELY,
 IT DID
MORE HARM
 THAN GOOD.
SEEING A RECORD
 OF THAT QUALITY
AMOUNTS TO THE PRINCIPLE
THAT YOU"'VE BEEN CHEATING
ALL ALONG.
THAT"'S ABSURD.
WELL, HOLMES... YOU WERE CAUGHT
WITH THE EXAMINATION ANSWERS
IN FRONT OF
 AN ENTIRE
CLASSROOM
 OF STUDENTS.
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
THE ANSWERS WERE
IN YOUR OWN HANDWRITING!
AN EXCELLENT JOB OF FORGERY.
WHO WOULD"'VE SUSPECTED DUDLEY
COULD PUT IT OFF?
I CAN PROVE MY INNOCENCE
IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME SOME TIME.
THE BOARD QUOTED
 THE SCHOOL
MOTTO
 AT LEAST FIVE TIMES.
HONESTY, PROBITY,
AND DILIGENCE.
EXACTLY!
IN THEIR EYES,
YOU"'VE COMMITTED
 THE
WORST CRIME
 IMAGINABLE.
I"'M BEING GIVEN
 THE WORST
PUNISHMENT
 IMAGINABLE...
EXPULSION.
I PROMISE...
I WILL DO EVERYTHING
WITHIN MY POWER TO HELP YOU.
I"'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR THIS DUDLEY FELLOW.
I"'LL WRITE
 A STERLING
RECOMMENDATION
THAT WILL GET YOU
 INTO
ANY SCHOOL
 IN ENGLAND.
I APPRECIATE THAT, SIR.
IF THERE"'S
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO...
OH. WELL, THERE IS ONE THING.
AH... ONE LAST DUEL.
YES, SIR.
HOLMES? YOU ALL RIGHT?
FINE. IT"'S JUST A SMALL CUT.
I LOST CONCENTRATION
FOR A MOMENT.
I SHOULD"'VE REMOVED MY RING.
I"'M SORRY.
IT WAS AN UNFAIR DISTRACTION.
THE MATCH IS YOURS.
LET"'S CALL IT A DRAW.
COME. LET MRS. DRIBB
LOOK AT THAT WOUND.
AH!
OOH.
THERE WE ARE.
THANK YOU, MRS. DRIBB.
WE"'RE ALL GOING
 TO MISS YOU
AROUND HERE,
 MR. HOLMES.
DUDLEY IS GOING
 TO
PAY DEARLY
 FOR THIS.
PUNCH TO THE JAW!
JAB TO THE RIBS!
NOW, NOW, WATSON.
REVENGE IS SWEETEST
WHEN IT"'S SERVED UP COLD.
COME.
HOLMES!
HA HA HA!
YOU DID THIS.
YOU"'RE RESPONSIBLE,
AREN"'T YOU?
SO THAT"'S WHERE
 I DROPPED
MY
 CHEMISTRY EXPERIMENT...
INTO YOUR TEA.
HA HA HA!
DON"'T WORRY, OLD CHAP.
IT WILL WEAR OFF, SHORTLY.
YOU SHOULD BE
 BACK TO
NORMAL
 BY SUMMERTIME.
CHESTNUTS!
HOT CHESTNUTS!
HOT CHESTNUTS!
CHESTNUTS!
DING-DONG, DING-DONG.
IS YOUR BROTHER EXPECTING YOU?
I"'LL BREAK THE NEWS
TO HIM WHEN I ARRIVE.
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
GET THEM OFF ME!
GET THEM OFF ME!
GET THEM OFF ME, PLEASE!
NO, SIR, NO!
SO THIS IS GOOD-BYE.
I REALLY EXPECTED US
TO BECOME GOOD FRIENDS.
[POLICE WHISTLE]
WHAT"'S GOING ON?
SIR! YOU DROPPED THIS!
EH TAR.
EH TAR.
JUST SEEMED TO GO MAD.
HE SNATCHED UP A KNIFE
AND STABBED HIMSELF.
EH TAR, HOLMES.
EH TAR.
SIR.
NO.
PLEASE, NO.
HOLMES!
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN.
MR. LESTRADE, THIS HAS
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH WHAT WE TALKED...
GET THESE TWO
 SCHOOLCHILDREN
AWAY FROM HERE!
MR. LESTRADE,
YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME.
WHOA!
MAN THAT IS BORN OF A WOMAN...
<i>A FEW DAYS LATER,</i>
<i>THEY BURIED
PROFESSOR WAXFLATTER.</i>
<i>I HAD NEVER BEEN
TO A FUNERAL BEFORE,</i>
<i>"THOUGH, UNFORTUNATELY,
I"'VE BEEN TO MANY SINCE.</i>
<i>HOLMES COULD NOT PUBLICLY
ATTEND THE FUNERAL.</i>
<i>HIS EXPULSION
PREVENTED SUCH A THING.</i>
<i>THE DEATH OF HIS MENTOR.</i>
<i>AND FRIEND.</i>
<i>HAD TAKEN ITS TOLL
ON SHERLOCK HOLMES.</i>
<i>IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,</i>
<i>I HAVE ONLY SEEN HOLMES
CRY ON TWO OCCASIONS.</i>
<i>TODAY WAS THE FIRST.</i>
NO.
UNCLE DIDN"'T KILL HIMSELF.
HE DIDN"'T?
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS MURDERED.
HOLMES,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
EXCUSE MY ENTRANCE.
I HAD TO CLIMB UP
THE FIRE ESCAPE.
I CAN"'T AFFORD TO BE SEEN.
I ONLY GOT HALFWAY
TO MYCROFT"'S HOME,
SOMETHING GNAWING
AT MY INSIDES.
I ORDERED THE DRIVER
TO TURN AROUND.
I"'M GOING TO MISS HIM,
TOO, ELIZABETH.
HE WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
I"'M SO GLAD YOU"'RE HERE.
I HAD TO COME BACK.
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
UNCLE WAS MURDERED?
I"'M CERTAIN OF IT.
COME ON NOW, HOLMES!
YOU SAW WAXFLATTER"'S
HAND ON THE KNIFE.
YOU HEARD
THE SHOPKEEPER"'S STORY
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A SUICIDE.
NEVER TRUST
THE OBVIOUS, WATSON.
THERE ARE TOO MANY
 PUZZLING
ELEMENTS
 TO ALL OF THIS...
FIRSTLY, A MAN
 HURLS
HIMSELF
 OUT OF A WINDOW.
SECOND, A REVEREND
 THROWS
HIMSELF
 UNDER A CARRIAGE,
ALL FOR NO APPARENT REASON.
AND THEN WAXFLATTER
STABS HIMSELF,
WHICH SEEMS
 COMPLETELY
UNBELIEVABLE
TO ALL OF US.
AND WHY SHOULD WAXFLATTER
BE OBSESSED WITH THEIR DEATHS?
HE"'D SAVE THOSE
NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS.
AND HE WAS ALWAYS
MEETING THAT ODD MAN.
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?
THAT MAN ATTENDED THE FUNERAL.
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?
NO. WHENEVER HE VISITED,
UNCLE WOULD USHER ME OUT
TO THE ATTIC.
I ASKED, BUT HE"'D
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
IN SOME WAY,
 THAT MAN IS
CONNECTED
 TO ALL THREE MURDERS.
WE MUST FIND OUT WHO HE IS.
YOU"'VE BOTH
 BEEN READING
TOO MANY
 DETECTIVE NOVELS.
THIS IS NOT FICTION, WATSON.
THERE"'S A MURDERER
ON THE LOOSE.
AND I"'LL FIND HIM.
HOW?
I"'LL LIVE HERE, WORK HERE...
IF THAT"'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?
YES.
WHAT IF WE"'RE FOUND?
ONLY THE THREE OF US
KNOW THAT I"'M HERE.
SOMEONE MAY SEE YOU LEAVING
OR COMING IN.
I"'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.
BUT YOU"'LL NEED
FOOD, SUPPLIES.
ME?
I CAN"'T!
YOU CAN RUN ERRANDS FOR ME,
WORK AS MY ASSISTANT.
I MIGHT GET CAUGHT.
AND THAT WOULD MEAN TROUBLE.
TROUBLE?
YOU"'D LET TROUBLE
RUIN AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR ADVENTURE.
I CAN"'T AFFORD TO JEOPARDIZE
MY MEDICAL CAREER.
WEASEL.
I"'M NOT A WEASEL.
I AM... PRACTICAL.
WEASELS ARE PRACTICAL.
AND I IMAGINED
 YOU COURAGEOUS...
 STOUT OF HEART.
I AM COURAGEOUS.
AND I"'M STOUT OF HEART.
IT"'S JUST THAT...
OH, ALL RIGHT. I"'LL DO IT.
THANK YOU, WATSON.
UNCLE WOULD"'VE WANTED
YOU TO HAVE THIS.
OH, BUT I...
PLEASE.
PUT IT ON.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA.
ON SECOND THOUGHT, TAKE IT OFF.
IT LOOKS VERY SILLY.
YOU CAN"'T WEAR HATS.
HA HA!
I THINK IT"'S BECOMING.
YOU"'RE TEASING.
NO, SERIOUSLY.
OH!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
<i>THE FOLLOWING DAY,</i>
<i>"WE SET OUT TO TRY TO SOLVE
WAXFLATTER"'S MURDER,</i>
<i>BUT WE HAD VERY LITTLE
TO GO ON.</i>
<i>WE ONLY HAD TWO CLUES...</i>
<i>WAXFLATTER"'S FINAL WORDS,
"EH TAR,".</i>
<i>AND THE BLOWPIPE
THAT WAS DROPPED.</i>
<i>AT THE SCENE OF HIS DEATH.</i>
<i>AS WE WALKED THROUGH
THE MARKETPLACE,</i>
<i>IT OCCURRED TO ME.</i>
<i>THAT WHEN THE CLOAKED
FIGURE RAN OFF,</i>
<i>I HAD HEARD
A PECULIAR JINGLING,</i>
<i>A JINGLING SOUND VERY MUCH LIKE.</i>
<i>THE SOUND I HEARD
IN THE LIBRARY.</i>
<i>ON MY FIRST DAY AT BROMPTON.</i>
<i>HOLMES WAS INTRIGUED
AND WE DECIDED.</i>
<i>TO VISIT THE SCHOOL LIBRARY.</i>
<i>LATER THAT NIGHT.</i>
<i>HOWEVER,
OUR FIRST STOP THAT DAY.</i>
<i>"WAS AT ENGLE"'S CURIO SHOP.</i>
NICE.
HOW VERY NICE.
EGYPTIAN.
THE MARKINGS, THE DESIGN...
THAT"'S EGYPTIAN
CRAFTSMANSHIP.
I"'VE ONLY SEEN
 THIS
PARTICULAR TYPE
 ONCE BEFORE.
WHERE?
ON JEWELRY, ON SCULPTURES.
I HAD IT HERE IN THE SHOP.
AH, BUT I SOLD THE LOT.
TO WHOM? AN EGYPTIAN.
OH, KEEPS SOME SORT OF TAVERN.
AND HIS NAME?
LET"'S SEE.
AH.
YOU PROMISED
TO PURCHASE SOMETHING.
WATSON, BUY SOMETHING.
ME?
I"'M SHORT OF FUNDS RIGHT NOW.
RUBBISH, YOU"'RE SHORT
OF FUNDS.
WATSON,
 THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE A PENNY PINCHER.
THAT ADDRESS
 COULD
LEAD US
 TO OUR KILLER.
HOW MUCH DO I NEED TO SPEND?
JUST BUY ANYTHING.
[COUGHING]
[COUGHING]
WHY ON EARTH
DID YOU BUY A PIPE?
IT LOOKS DISTINGUISHED.
IT"'S PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS.
YOU"'LL SEE.
I SHALL LEARN TO SMOKE IT,
AND THEN YOU CAN"'T LAUGH.
YOU"'LL SEE...
[COUGHING]
[SPEAKING ARABIC]
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU BOYS,
DRINK, FOOD, WOMEN?
HA HA HA.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SOUP?
WATSON, PLEASE.
ARE YOU THE OWNER
OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT?
HAVE YOU
 EVER SEEN
THIS,
 BEFORE?
<i>RAME TEP.</i>
<i>RAME TEP!</i>
<i>RAME TEP!</i>
<i>RAME TEP!</i>
<i>RAME TEP!</i>
IS THAT THE END OF THE SONG?
WHERE...
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM?
I HAPPENED UPON IT.
GO! TAKE IT AWAY!
GET OUT OF HERE!
SIR, IT"'S VERY IMPORTANT.
COULD YOU TELL US
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?
[SPEAKING ARABIC]
NOW, GET OUT OF MY TAVERN,
OR THESE WORDS
 WILL BE THE
LAST WORDS
 YOU WILL EVER HEAR.
SIR...
WE"'RE LEAVING.
WE"'RE LEAVING.
RIGHT UP THERE, THE TOP SHELF.
THAT"'S WHERE
I HEARD THE SOUND.
HOLMES, PLEASE HURRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I"'M CAUGHT?
INCREDIBLE.
HOLMES, YOUR VOICE,
KEEP IT DOWN.
SORRY, WATSON.
MY GOD, THAT IS REMARKABLE!
HOLMES, PLEASE!
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD,
 WHAT ARE MY
CHANCES
 OF MEDICAL SCHOOL...
THAT QUAINT LITTLE OFFICE
I"'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF?
WATSON, LISTEN TO THIS...
<i>HOLMES WENT ON TO EXPLAIN.</i>
<i>THAT THE RAME TEP
WERE A FANATICAL GROUP.</i>
<i>OF RELIGIOUS FOLLOWERS
OF OSIRIS,</i>
<i>THE EGYPTIAN GOD OF THE DEAD.</i>
<i>THEY WERE SCORNED BY SOCIETY.</i>
<i>BECAUSE OF THEIR DISTORTION.</i>
<i>OF TRADITIONAL
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS,</i>
<i>AND THEIR VIOLENT
AND SADISTIC RITUALS.</i>
<i>THE RAME TEP USE A BLOWPIPE.</i>
<i>AND SHOOT A THORN
INTO THEIR CHOSEN VICTIM.</i>
<i>THE THORN IS DIPPED
INTO A SOLUTION.</i>
<i>MADE UP OF VARIOUS PLANT
AND ROOT EXTRACTS.</i>
<i>WHEN THE SOLUTION
ENTERS THE BLOODSTREAM,</i>
<i>IT CAUSES THE VICTIM.</i>
<i>TO EXPERIENCE VERY REALISTIC,</i>
<i>NIGHTMARE-LIKE HALLUCINATIONS.</i>
BUT WE CAN
 BE
CERTAIN
 OF ONE THING.
WHAT"'S THAT?
THE MURDERER IS STILL HERE...
ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.
DEAR, THAT"'S SORT OF
A RASH STATEMENT,
CONSIDERING THAT THIS
 SAID JINGLING
SOUND"'S
 BEEN HEARD ONLY ONCE.
TWICE.
TWICE?
REMEMBER
 A FEW NIGHTS
AGO
 IN THE COURTYARD?
UNCAS HEARD A JINGLING SOUND.
LIKE YOU DESCRIBED.
HE TOOK A PIECE
 OF
CLOTHING
 FROM HIM.
WELL, IT MIGHT STILL BE HERE!
WE MUST SEARCH EVERY INCH.
WE MUST FIND THAT PIECE
OF CLOTHING.
<i>WE IMMEDIATELY
SPRANG INTO ACTION,</i>
<i>SEARCHING EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY.</i>
<i>FOR THE CLOTH.</i>
<i>I ACCIDENTALLY TURNED ON.</i>
<i>"ONE OF WAXFLATTER"'S
STRANGE MACHINES.</i>
<i>AND NOT BEING AT ALL
MECHANICALLY MINDED,</i>
<i>I HAD THE DICKENS OF A TIME.</i>
<i>TRYING TO TURN THE THING OFF.</i>
I FOUND IT! I FOUND IT!
<i>HOLMES SPENT THE ENTIRE NIGHT.</i>
<i>AND THE FOLLOWING DAY.</i>
<i>STUDYING, EXAMINING,
SCRUTINIZING.</i>
<i>THE SECTION OF CLOTH.</i>
<i>HE CONDUCTED EXPERIMENT
AFTER EXPERIMENT.</i>
<i>NOT ONCE DID HE
STOP FOR A REST.</i>
<i>HIS ENERGY SEEMED BOUNDLESS.</i>
<i>FOLLOWING 18
STRAIGHT HOURS OF WORK,</i>
<i>HOLMES TURNED TO
ELIZABETH AND MYSELF,</i>
<i>AND THOSE FOUR FAMILIAR
WORDS SHOT FROM HIS LIPS.</i>
THE GAME IS AFOOT.
<i>HOLMES EXPLAINED THAT
THE FABRIC WAS EGYPTIAN.</i>
<i>AND CONTAINED SO MANY
WARP AND WEFT THREADS...</i>
<i>"THINGS THAT TO THIS DAY
I STILL DON"'T UNDERSTAND.</i>
<i>HE FOUND THAT THE CLOTH
WAS STAINED WITH PARAFFIN.</i>
<i>PARAFFIN
MANUFACTURED EXCLUSIVELY.</i>
<i>AT FROGGIT AND FROGGIT,</i>
<i>LOCATED IN THE WAPPING
AREA OF LONDON,</i>
<i>A DARK AND DANGEROUS PLACE.</i>
<i>AND I TURNED TO HOLMES,
AND I TOLD HIM SO.</i>
<i>IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS.</i>
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
COME BACK TOMORROW,
WHEN IT"'S LIGHTER,
WHEN THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE.
IT"'S OPEN.
HOLMES, WAIT.
WHAT IF THE
MURDERER"'S INSIDE?
WELL, I SHALL
 INTRODUCE
MYSELF
 TO HIM.
I KNEW IT.
THERE"'S NO ONE HERE.
AND BACK TO SCHOOL, EH?
WATSON!
YOU"'LL BE ON YOUR OWN.
OH.
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IT IS?
SOME SORT OF EGYPTIAN ARTWORK?
SOME SORT OF STATUE?
NO, WATSON.
I"'M AFRAID THIS
 IS ONLY
THE TIP
 OF THE ICEBERG.
AAH!
[COUGHING]
THIS IS AN INTERESTING
DEVELOPMENT.
THERE MUST BE
A PASSAGEWAY INSIDE.
I HEAR CHANTING.
HOLMES, THERE"'S A DOOR HERE.
FANCY HIM MISSING A DOOR.
WATSON, ELIZABETH, OVER HERE.
IT"'S SOME SORT OF TEMPLE.
[CHANTING]
[CHANTING]
I"'M GOING DOWN
FOR A CLOSER LOOK.
HOLMES, LET"'S GET OUT OF HERE
WITH OUR LIVES.
STAY HERE.
 I"'LL BE
BACK
 IN A FEW MINUTES.
[CHANTING]
AAH!
STOP! SHE"'S ALIVE!
GET HIM! GET HIM!
GET HIM!
WE GOT THEM!
ELIZABETH!
CAN YOU HEAR?
ELIZABETH! ELIZABETH!
WHAT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO HER?
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HIT BY A THORN.
ELIZABETH!
AAH!
AAH!
ELIZABETH!
I THINK I HEAR SOMETHING.
YOU"'RE RIGHT.
AAH!
PLEASE!
UNCLE! DON"'T!
DON"'T!
PLEASE!
HELP ME!
NO!
ELIZABETH!
NO!
HELP ME TIE HER DOWN.
WHAT WITH?
GET MY SCARF.
QUICKLY.
I DON"'T WANT TO DIE!
HA! HA HA HA HA! HA HA!
IT"'S NOT REAL.
IT"'S A HALLUCINATION.
LISTEN TO ME, IT"'S NOT REAL.
YOU"'RE HALLUCINATING.
WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!
YOU"'VE GOT TO WAKE UP!
IT"'S NOT REAL.
UNCLE! NO!
 YOU"'RE
HALLUCINATING.
LISTEN TO ME!
PLEASE! HELP!
THEY"'RE HALLUCINATIONS!
ELIZABETH, LISTEN TO ME!
PLEASE. NO!
NOW, WATSON... WATSON?
DEAR GOD, NOT WATSON, TOO.
PLEASE!
WATSON!
WATSON!
WATSON!
GET HIM, GET HIM, GET HIM!
[SOBBING]
PLEASE DON"'T CRY, MOTHER.
PLEASE.
DON"'T YOU UNDERSTAND, MOTHER?
CAN"'T YOU HEAR ME?
CAN"'T YOU HEAR
WHAT I"'M SAYING?
MOTHER!
YOU!
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT, SON.
HOW COULD YOU DO
SUCH A THING TO ME?
TO YOUR OWN FATHER?
SPYING ON ME.
FORGIVE ME, FATHER.
PLEASE, I DIDN"'T REALIZE.
MY PRIVATE LIFE IS MY OWN.
YOUR MOTHER NEED
NEVER HAVE KNOWN.
FATHER!
NO! NO! NO!
THIS IS NOT REAL!
THIS IS NOT REAL!
THIS IS NOT REAL.
IT"'S JUST A HALLUCINATION.
IT"'S ONLY IN MY MIND.
IT"'S ONLY A HALLUCINATION.
MAYBE NOT.
NO! NO!
PLEASE, NO!
STAY RIGHT THERE,
OR I"'LL BLOW
 YOUR
BLEEDING
 HEADS OFF!
I"'VE CONVINCED HIM
TO DROP THE CHARGES.
HOLMES, YOU AND YOUR
LITTLE FRIENDS
HAVE COST ME A NIGHT"'S SLEEP.
NOW, PLEASE, GOOD MORNING.
MR. LESTRADE...
THESE
 RELIGIOUS FANATICS
ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW MANY DEATHS.
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT THEY"'RE ALSO RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE FOUR YOUNG GIRLS
WHO MYSTERIOUSLY
DISAPPEARED
 LAST MONTH
I BEG OF YOU,
BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.
BASED ON WHAT,
YOUR IMAGINATION?
A GREAT
 DETECTIVE
RELIES
 ON PERCEPTION,
INTELLIGENCE, AND IMAGINATION.
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT RUBBISH FROM?
IT"'S FRAMED ON
THE WALL BEHIND YOU.
OH, GOSH.
DAMN IT, HOLMES.
I REALLY DON"'T SEE WHY
I SHOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN
MY ACTIONS TO YOU?
I SPENT THE LAST SEVEN YEARS
AT SCOTLAND YARD...
STUDYING, ANALYZING
HUNDREDS OF CASES.
AND YOU, WITH YOUR
BACKGROUND OF SCHOOLBOOKS
AND NEWSPAPER HEADLINES,
YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU KNOW
MORE THAN ME.
I DESPISE YOUR ARROGANCE!
AND I DESPISE YOUR LAZINESS.
OUT!
ALL OF YOU!
SIMPLY LEAVE.
IF YOU HAVE ANY
 INVESTIGATIVE
POWER
 IN YOU AT ALL,
YOU"'LL HAVE
SOMEONE TEST THESE.
MAYBE THEN
YOU"'LL BE CONVINCED.
OUT, HOLMES.
OH.
OW.
BLAST.
HOLMES, COULD YOU PLEASE STOP
THAT INFERNAL TINKERING?
I STILL HAVE A HEADACHE
FROM THOSE HALLUCINATIONS.
TINKERING HELPS ME THINK.
SLEEP HELPS ME THINK.
THERE"'S NO TIME
FOR SLEEP, WATSON!
WE"'VE GOT TO KEEP WORKING.
WE"'VE GOT TO FIND CLUES
SOMETHING MUST LINK WAXFLATTER
TO THE RAME TEP.
WHAT A PICTURE, EH, HOLMES?
I WANT CLUES, WATSON,
NOT ART CRITIQUES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
 I"'VE BEEN
DOING
 FOR THE PAST HOUR?
YES, MR. FRENCH PASTRY.
I HAVE NOTHING
 WHATSOEVER
TO SAY TO YOU.
I TRUST
 YOU HAVE
NOTHING
 TO SAY TO ME.
WATSON! WATSON!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH THAT PAINTING?
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU"'VE FOUND?
WAXFLATTER AS A YOUNG MAN.
NOT JUST THAT.
BENTLY BOBSTER, DUNCAN NESBITT,
RUPERT WAXFLATTER.
ALL OF THESE MEN DIED RECENTLY
EXCEPT THIS MAN...
THIS IS CHESTER CRAGWITCH.
HE WAS HERE IN THE WINDOW,
AND AT THE FUNERAL.
HE"'S THE ONLY MAN IN THIS
GROUP WHO"'S STILL ALIVE.
GOOD LORD.
THIS IS THE CLUE
WE"'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
WE"'RE GETTING THERE, WATSON!
WE"'RE GOING TO SOLVE
THIS CRIME!
GOOD SHOW, WATSON!
HOLMES, I DID NOT
 EXPECT OUR
FOILS
 TO CROSS SO SOON.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HIDING AT WAXFLATTERS.
YOU"'RE FORGETTING
WE SHARE THE SAME
 KEEN
POWERS
 OF OBSERVATION.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, SIR?
I SHALL BE NEEDING
YOUR ASSISTANCE
WITH THESE STUDENTS.
MR. HOLMES.
I THOUGHT YOU"'D GONE.
WE WERE ALL UNDER
THE SAME IMPRESSION,
MRS. DRIBB.
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY,
MR. HOLMES
 IS IN A
RATHER
 AWFUL MESS.
IF THE BOARD KNEW OF THIS
THEY WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE YOU ARRESTED.
AND THEN YOU"'D BE
SENT TO PRISON.
BUT THERE"'S NO NEED
TO TELL THE BOARD.
HOLMES, I"'M WILLING TO FORGET
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.
TOMORROW, YOU WILL GO HOME
AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED.
WATSON, YOU WILL DO THE SAME.
I"'M BEING EXPELLED, SIR?
WATSON, IF I WERE TO TAKE THIS
BEFORE THE BOARD,
YOU"'D BE SUMMARILY EXPELLED.
THIS WILL SAVE YOU
ANY SUCH DISGRACE.
ELIZABETH,
DID YOU PERMIT
 MR. HOLMES TO
STAY
 IN YOUR UNCLE"'S STUDY?
YES.
OH, DEAR.
I FIND THAT
 EXTREMELY
UNLADYLIKE BEHAVIOR
IN ONE SO YOUNG.
INDEED.
SIR, MAY I SUGGEST
THAT WE HAVE THE DOG
TAKEN TO THE POUND?
[WHIMPERS]
WHAT?
I BELIEVE
 OTHER SCHOOLS
DO NOT ALLOW PETS.
YOU CAN"'T TAKE HIM AWAY.
WELL, PERHAPS
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I SHOULD TAKE CARE
OF HIM MYSELF.
HOLMES...
IT GRIEVES ME
THAT YOU"'VE
 TAKEN
ADVANTAGE
 OF MY FRIENDSHIP.
I THINK THAT IT IS NOW TIME
TO DISPOSE OF EVERYTHING
IN WAXFLATTER"'S LABORATORY.
BUT, SIR,
THE LABORATORY IS FILLED
WITH MR. WAXFLATTER"'S
INVENTIONS...
HIS DRAWINGS, HIS EXPERIMENTS.
WE MUSTN"'T CLING
 TO
THINGS
 OF THE PAST.
IT"'S THE MAN"'S
WHOLE LIFE"'S WORK.
AND HIS LIFE IS OVER.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT!
MR. HOLMES.
I"'M SURPRISED AT YOUR TONE.
ESPECIALLY WITH ME!
I APOLOGIZE.
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.
TAKE YOUR SEAT.
YOU"'LL HAVE TO STAY
HERE OVERNIGHT.
THERE"'S
 NO TRANSPORTATION,
AT THIS LATE HOUR.
MRS. DRIBB, PLACE
THE BOYS IN 14-B.
KEEP THE YOUNG LADY
 IN
YOUR
 ADJOINING ROOM.
HOLMES...
REMEMBER
 WHAT I
ALWAYS
 TAUGHT YOU.
CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS,
OR THEY WILL BE YOUR DOWNFALL.
YES, SIR.
I KNEW IT.
IT"'S THE END
OF MY MEDICAL CAREER.
MY FATHER"'S GOING
TO BE FURIOUS.
I ALWAYS SUSPECTED
BECOMING A FRIEND OF YOURS
WOULD END IN DISASTER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU TRYING TO GET US ARRESTED!
WE CAN LEAVE, NOW.
I"'M STAYING HERE.
PLEASE, I NEED YOU.
WATSON,
 WE"'RE IN
THIS
 TOGETHER,
WE"'RE A TEAM.
[TAP TAP]
ELIZABETH, WAKE UP!
THIS IS CHESTER CRAGWITCH.
THE MAN WHO VISITED UNCLE.
THE ONE
 YOU SAID RAN
FROM THE FUNERAL.
EXACTLY.
DOESN"'T IT STRIKE YOU AS ODD
THAT HE"'S THE ONLY
 SURVMNG
MEMBER
 OF THIS GROUP?
ELIZABETH, GO BACK
TO THE LABORATORY.
SALVAGE AS MANY
 OF
YOUR UNCLE"'S
 FORMULAS
AND INVENTIONS AS YOU CAN.
WE"'LL MEET YOU THERE.
FIRST, WE"'VE GOT
 TO GET
OURSELVES
 OUT OF HERE.
WATSON.
YES?
HOLMES.
BE CAREFUL TONIGHT.
THIS IS TOO MUCH.
GO AWAY, RAME TEP!
BLOODY MURDERERS, GO AWAY!
YOU WON"'T GET ME!
SIR.
MR. CRAGWITCH.
WE WERE FRIENDS
OF MR. WAXFLATTER.
I KNOW YOU.
YOU"'RE THE YOUNGSTER
WHO FOLLOWED ME
AT THE CEMETERY.
GO AWAY.
I"'M A DANGEROUS MAN
TO BE AROUND.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY THE RAME TEP
KILLED FIVE MEN?
GO IN.
GET UP, NOW, WATSON.
THE WAR"'S OVER.
[JINGLING]
WE WERE TO BECOME
BUSINESS PARTNERS,
ALL SIX OF US.
BORROWED MONEY
 FROM OUR
FATHERS
 TO BUILD AN HOTEL...
THE MOST
 LUXURIOUS
HOTEL
 EVER CONCEIVED.
WHERE BETTER TO BUILD...
THAN EGYPT?
LABOR AND MATERIALS
WERE INEXPENSIVE.
A FEW YEARS EARLIER,
THE BRITISH ARMY
 HAD
DRIVEN OUT
 THE FRENCH.
IT SEEMED THE LAND
OF EXTREME OPPORTUNITY.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE ENGAGED
 AN
ARCHITECT,
 WORK BEGAN.
BUT WHAT STARTED OUT
AS A BUSINESS VENTURE...
SOON BECAME A MAJOR
ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND.
WE DISCOVERED
AN UNDERGROUND PYRAMID.
THE ANCIENT TOMBS
OF FIVE EGYPTIAN PRINCESSES.
WE REMOVED ALL THE RELICS
AND TREASURES,
PREPARING TO SEND THEM
TO ENGLAND, BUT... OH.
BLOODY INSECT.
PLACE NEEDS A GOOD CLEANING.
THERE WAS AN UPROAR.
VILLAGERS IN THE AREA
WERE CONVINCED
WE DESECRATED SACRED GROUND.
OUR LIVES WERE IN DANGER.
THE BRITISH SENT TROOPS IN.
SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE KILLED.
AN ENTIRE VILLAGE
WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND.
BURNT...
FIRE...
AAH!
MR. CRAGWITCH, ARE YOU O.K.?
AAH!
THEY"'VE HIT
 CRAGWITCH
WITH A THORN!
I"'M FALLING!
AAH!
LISTEN TO ME.
YOUR NAME IS CHESTER CRAGWITCH.
YOU"'RE A BANKER.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YOU"'RE CHESTER CRAGWITCH.
WHO ARE YOU?
MY NAME IS CRAGWITCH.
CHESTER CRAGWITCH.
I RESIDE AT CRAGWITCH MANOR,
HAMPSTEAD...
MY GOD.
IT WAS SO REAL.
REAL, SO VERY REAL.
YES, I MUSTN"'T FORGET.
I MUST PASS ON
THIS INFORMATION.
IT"'S TIME SOMEONE ELSE KNEW.
EVERYTHING!
THE EGYPTIAN VILLAGE,
WAS IT BURNT TO THE GROUND?
YES.
YES! YES!
LUCKILY, WE GOT OUT OF EGYPT
WITH OUR LIVES.
WHEN WE RETURNED TO ENGLAND,
WE WENT OUR SEPARATE WAYS.
HOWEVER,
WE KEPT IN FREQUENT TOUCH
WITH WAXFLATTER
THROUGH REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE.
WHEN THE MURDERS BEGAN,
I MET QUITE FREQUENTLY
WITH MY DEAR FRIEND.
WHAT DOES THIS
 HAVE TO
DO
 WITH THE RAME TEP?
ALMOST A YEAR
AFTER THE INCIDENT,
EACH ONE OF US
RECEIVED THIS LETTER,
SENT BY A YOUNG BOY.
A YOUNG BOY OF
ANGLO-EGYPTIAN DESCENT.
YOU"'LL NOTICE THAT THE
LETTERHEAD IS ADORNED
BY THE SYMBOL OF THE RAME TEP...
TWO GOLDEN SERPENTS.
THE BOY WHO WROTE THE LETTER,
AND HIS SISTER
WERE STAYING IN ENGLAND
WITH THEIR GRANDFATHER
WHEN THEY LEARNED
OF THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE EGYPTIAN VILLAGE.
THE VILLAGE
WHICH WAS THEIR HOME.
BOTH THEIR PARENTS WERE
KILLED IN THE ATTACK.
THE BOY VOWED
WHEN HE GREW TO MANHOOD
THAT THE RAME TEP
WOULD TAKE THEIR REVENGE
AND REPLACE THE BODIES
OF THE FIVE
EGYPTIAN PRINCESSES.
AND THE BOY
WAS CALLED "EH TAR"?
"EH TAR."
WAXFLATTER"'S FINAL WORDS!
VERY GOOD, WATSON.
EH TAR!
YOU FILTHY MURDERER.
WELL, YOU WON"'T KILL ME.
WATSON,
SPEAK TO HIM.
WHAT? OH.
YOUR NAME IS CRAGGY CRITCH...
YOUR NAME IS...
YOUR NAME IS...
WHAT"'S HIS NAME?
CRAGWITCH.
AAH!
MR. LESTRADE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I ACCIDENTALLY STUCK MYSELF
WITH ONE OF THOSE
DAMNED THORNS.
THE HALLUCINATIONS... GHASTLY.
TOOK FOUR POLICEMEN
TO STOP ME FROM HANGING MYSELF.
ANYWAY, WHEN IT WAS OVER,
I THOUGHT I"'D BETTER
LOOK INTO YOUR STORY.
NOW, HOLMES, I WISH YOU
AND YOUR FRIEND FAREWELL.
I APPRECIATE YOU GETTING ME
STARTED ON THE CASE.
GETTING HIM STARTED.
IMAGINE THAT, WATSON.
I"'VE ONLY DONE
ALL THE WORK FOR HIM.
IT"'S YOU.
YES, MY DEAR.
[DOG BARKS]
[JINGLING]
GRRR!
GRRR!
OOH!
AAAAHH!
STOP HER. SHE"'S A MURDERER.
SO, MY DEAR.
 YOU"'VE
DISCOVERED
 OUR LITTLE SECRET.
WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS?
YOU"'LL NEVER FIND THEM.
YOU"'LL NEVER FIND THEM.
YOU"'LL NEVER FIND THEM.
NEVER FIND THEM.
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH HER?
SHE"'LL COME WITH US.
WE NEED A FIFTH PRINCESS.
HOLMES! I"'VE
SOLVED THE RIDDLE!
THE BEAR IS WHITE.
GOOD, WATSON. DO YOU KNOW WHY?
WELL, UM... NO.
IT WAS THE ONE COLOR
I DIDN"'T CHOOSE.
KEEP THINKING, WATSON.
ANSWERS
 WITHOUT
EVIDENCE
 ARE USELESS.
THIS RIDDLE
 IS GOING
TO GIVE ME
 A HEADACHE.
EH TAR...
EH TAR.
CAN"'T YOU THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE?
IT"'S NECESSARY.
IT IS ANNOYING.
ARF! ARF! ARF!
THIS SILLY BEAR PUZZLE, HOLMES.
I CAN"'T WORK IT OUT.
I KNOW THE BEAR"'S
 WHITE,
BUT I DON"'T
 KNOW WHY.
I"'M NOT STUPID OR ANYTHING.
WATSON, YOU"'VE GOT TO THINK
THE WHOLE THING THROUGH.
TAKE IT APART, PIECE BY PIECE.
YOUR FACE IS BLEEDING AGAIN.
THIS CUT FROM RATHE"'S RING
NEVER SEEMS TO HEAL.
THE BEAR IS WHITE BECAUSE...
OH, GOD.
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?
WHAT?
IT"'S RATHE, WATSON.
IT"'S RATHE!
HYAH! GIDDYUP!
COME ON.
FASTER!
GIDDYUP! GIDDYUP THERE!
RATHE GOT ELIZABETH!
ONLY ONE WAY TO CATCH THEM.
HOW?
COME ON.
WHERE?
THIS IS MADNESS, HOLMES.
IT"'S OUR ONLY CHANCE, WATSON.
WAXFLATTER
 WORKED ON
THIS
 UNTIL HIS DEATH.
I"'VE TINKERED MYSELF.
HOPEFULLY,
 THE PROBLEMS
ARE CORRECTED.
COMING?
OH, DEAR.
WHAT HAVE I GOT MYSELF INTO?
THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME.
UNCAS... PULL!
IT WORKS, WATSON! IT WORKS!
WE"'RE FLYING!
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, WATSON?
WE"'RE FLYING!
FASTER! GIDDYUP!
FASTER!
FASTER!
HYAH!
HYAH!
HOLMES, DOWN THERE!
HOLMES, LOOK OUT!
MY GOD!
IT"'S NEARLY HALF PAST 12:00!
I"'VE REALIZED SOMETHING.
I"'VE NO IDEA HOW TO LAND.
HOLD TIGHT, WATSON.
I"'M HOLDING!
WE"'RE GOING TO CRASH!
OH, HURRY, HOLMES!
WE"'RE SINKING BACK HERE!
ALL RIGHT!
[CHANTING]
[JINGLING]
MY GOD. THEY"'RE
GOING TO KILL HER.
ELIZABETH.
ELIZABETH.
I DON"'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
2 OF US, 100 OF THEM.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
PERHAPS WE"'VE LEARNED
SOMETHING WE CAN APPLY.
WATSON, FOR GOODNESS SAKE.
I CAN"'T THINK OF ANYTHING.
WHY DON"'T YOU
THINK OF SOMETHING?
THAT"'S NOT HELPFUL.
SORRY.
WHY CAN"'T I THINK
OF ANYTHING?
YOU"'RE FLUSTERED,
YOU MUST CALM DOWN.
THEN YOU THINK.
WELL, I"'M FLUSTERED!
WATSON... I"'VE GOT IT.
WE MUST CREATE A DIVERSION.
CREATE A DIVERSION?
WHY DIDN"'T I THINK OF THAT?
IF MY GEOMETRY
SERVES ME CORRECTLY,
ONE BEAM MISPLACED
 WILL
BRING DOWN
 THIS WHOLE THING
LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS.
[CHANTING]
WATSON, I"'VE A PLAN.
HURRY.
HURRY UP!
HOLMES!
AAH!
AAH!
OH!
AAH!
HOLMES!
LOOK OUT!
HOLMES!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WATSON, GET HER OUT OF HERE!
AAH! AAH!
OH, NO.
HOLMES!
HOLMES, RATHE HAS TAKEN
ELIZABETH,
AND THE STAIRS ARE BLOCKED!
WHAT SHALL I DO?
GO AROUND
 THE OTHER
WAY,
 WATSON.
YOU MUST STOP HIM!
HOLMES!
HOLMES!
HOLMES! HOLMES!
NO!
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
NO!
NO!
GIDDYUP!
HYAH!
HYAH!
HYAH! HYAH!
WHOA! AAH!
GOOD SHOW, WATSON.
ELIZABETH.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I THINK SO.
PLEASE.
WHAT ARE WE
 GOING
TO DO
 ABOUT RATHE?
WHERE IS HE?
HE"'S GONE.
THE POLICE WILL FIND HIM.
ELIZABETH.
IT"'S STRANGE.
STRANGE.
LET"'S GO BACK NOW.
I DON"'T KNOW HOW I"'LL
EXPLAIN THIS TO MY PARENTS.
IT"'LL BE EXPLAINED
IN TOMORROW"'S PAPERS.
WILL THEY LET YOU
COME BACK TO SCHOOL?
I DON"'T KNOW. PERHAPS.
HOLMES!
NO!
DAMN!
ELIZABETH.
ELIZABETH.
WATSON, PUT MY COAT AROUND HER.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I"'M GOING TO GET HIM.
HOLMES, YOU"'LL BE KILLED!
EH TAR!
YOU"'RE NOTHING
BUT A DAMN FRAUD!
AND YOU HOLMES,
 ARE
LETTING
 YOUR EMOTIONS
GET THE BETTER OF YOU, AGAIN.
YOU CANNOT BEST ME, HOLMES.
THROW DOWN YOUR SWORD!
NEVER! I"'D RATHER
 DIE A
GRUESOME
 AND HORRIBLE DEATH.
VERY WELL. I WILL OBLIGE.
COME, HOLMES,
 IS THIS
THE BEST
 YOU COULD DO...
FIGHT LIKE
 AN
UNDERNOURISHED
 CHILD.
I"'VE ALREADY WON THE BATTLE!
YOU"'VE LOST
EVERY BATTLE, EH TAR.
THIS WILL BE NO EXCEPTION.
ALL YOUR DREAMS
HAVE BEEN SHATTERED...
YOUR TEMPLE, EVERYTHING
HAS BEEN DESTROYED FOREVER!
AH!
AH!
AH!
AAHHH!
ELIZABETH.
ELIZABETH.
YES, HOLMES!
LET"'S TARRY A WHILE LONGER,
AS ELIZABETH"'S BLOOD
FLOWS FROM HER BODY!
AAH!
AAH.
ELIZABETH, COME ON.
WAKE UP.
OPEN YOUR EYES.
ELIZABETH.
ELIZABETH.
HOLMES.
DON"'T BE SAD.
SOMEDAY,
WE"'LL BE REUNITED
IN ANOTHER WORLD,
A MUCH BETTER WORLD.
I"'LL BE WAITING.
YOU"'LL BE LATE...
AS ALWAYS.
ELIZABETH... NO.
NO.
NO.
ELIZABETH.
NO...
ELIZABETH.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT.
YOU"'D THINK HE UNCOVERED
THE ENTIRE CASE ON HIS OWN.
EXACTLY!
THAT"'S WHAT HE WANTED
THE YARD TO BELIEVE.
WHAT OTHER REASON
WOULD THEY HAVE
FOR GMNG HIM THE PROMOTION?
BYE, UNCAS.
STAY THERE, UNCAS.
I"'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.
HOLMES, A FEW THINGS
STILL HAUNT ME.
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
BEGIN TO SUSPECT
THAT RATHE WAS INVOLVED
WITH THE RAME TEP?
WHEN WAXFLATTER FIRST RETIRED,
THE BOARD WANTED HIM
TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL.
RATHE ARGUED, FOUGHT
 UNTIL
HE CONVINCED
 THE BOARD
TO LET WAXFLATTER REMAIN
WITHIN THE SCHOOL GROUNDS.
IT SEEMED STRANGE TO ME.
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY RATHE
WANTED WAXFLATTER TO STAY.
HE WAS FOND OF
WAXFLATTER"'S INVENTIONS?
WHAT"'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
HAVE YOU BEEN ASLEEP
THROUGH THIS
 ENTIRE CASE?
SORRY.
<i>HOLMES WENT ON TO EXPLAIN.</i>
<i>THAT RATHE SPENT YEARS.</i>
<i>PLOTTING HIS REVENGE.</i>
<i>HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
AS A RESPECTED MEMBER.</i>
<i>OF BRITISH SOCIETY,</i>
<i>COMPLETELY ERASING
HIS FORMER IDENTITY.</i>
<i>IT TOOK HIM
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME.</i>
<i>TO ORGANIZE HIS FOLLOWERS...</i>
<i>MADE UP OF THE POOR,
THE HOMELESS,</i>
<i>THE LOST SOULS
OF THE LONDON STREETS.</i>
<i>AND THEN, OF COURSE,
IT TOOK TIME.</i>
<i>TO BUILD A WOODEN REPLICA
OF THE PYRAMID.</i>
<i>"MRS. DRIBB WAS THE RAME TEP"'S
CHIEF ASSASSIN.</i>
<i>BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
SHE WAS RATHE"'S YOUNGER SISTER.</i>
AMAZING, HOLMES.
SIMPLY AMAZING.
OF COURSE, YOU DID FORGET
ONE VERY IMPORTANT CLUE.
OH? PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME.
RATHE IS EH TAR
SPELLED BACKWARDS.
VERY CLEVER, WATSON.
I"'M CERTAIN I WOULD
HAVE ARRIVED
AT THAT CONCLUSION
SOONER OR LATER.
SOONER OR LATER.
ARE YOU COMING BACK
AFTER THE HOLIDAYS?
NO. I"'M TRANSFERRING.
THERE ARE TOO MANY
MEMORIES HERE.
HOLMES, YOU HAVE
 YOUR
ENTIRE LIFE
 AHEAD OF YOU.
I"'LL SPEND IT ALONE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, HOLMES.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE
MORE LUCK SMOKING IT.
WELL?
IT DOES SEEM TO SUIT YOU,
BUT THAT COAT...
WHY DO YOU INSIST ON WEARING
THAT RIDICULOUS CLOAK
OF THAT UNSPEAKABLE PERSON?
CONSIDER IT A TROPHY, WATSON.
A SKIN OF A LEOPARD.
INDEED.
I"'M GOING TO MISS YOU,
WATSON.
I"'M GOING
 TO MISS
YOU,
 TOO, HOLMES.
YOU KNOW,
 YOU WERE
RIGHT
 ABOUT SOMETHING.
ABOUT WHAT?
IT WAS THE ADVENTURE
OF A LIFETIME.
HOLMES, WAIT.
I KNOW WHY THE BEAR"'S WHITE!
AND WHY IS THAT, WATSON?
WELL THE ONLY ROOM
WITH AN ALL SOUTHERN VIEW
WOULD BE ON THE NORTH POLE.
IT"'S A POLAR BEAR!
YOU HAVE THE MAKINGS
OF A GREAT DETECTIVE.
<i>AS I WATCHED HOLMES
SETTLE INTO HIS SEAT,</i>
<i>A SUDDEN FEELING CAME OVER ME...</i>
<i>THAT I WOULD MOST CERTAINLY.</i>
<i>BE SEEING HIM AGAIN.</i>
<i>SO ENDED MY FIRST ADVENTURE
WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES.</i>
<i>AS I WATCHED
HIS CARRIAGE DISAPPEAR,</i>
<i>"I REALIZED THAT
I"'D FORGOTTEN TO THANK HIM.</i>
<i>HE HAD TAKEN A WEAK BOY.</i>
<i>AND MADE HIM
INTO A COURAGEOUS, STRONG MAN.</i>
<i>I WAS FILLED WITH CONFIDENCE.</i>
<i>I WAS READY
FOR WHATEVER MYSTERY LAY AHEAD.</i>
<i>I WAS READY TO TAKE ON
THE GREATEST ADVENTURE.</i>
<i>I KNEW IT WOULD PROBABLY
INVOLVE SHERLOCK HOLMES.</i>
CAN I HELP YOU?
I"'D LIKE A ROOM, PLEASE.
PLEASE, SIR, TO SIGN HERE.
