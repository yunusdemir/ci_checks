The puppies performed in this movie
are safely supervised
in the presence of the related
administrator and the professional medic.
What a fine day!
I'd like to go hiking
and take a nap
in the mountain.
Wake up, man.
- Jun-pyo.
- What?
I don't think I'm cut out
to be a professor.
Shut up.
Maybe it's God's will.
God my ass!
It's the dean's will.
He's the one who calls the shots.
I don't want to say it.
You're so pigheaded.
Kung-min took your place.
You fool.
You asked for it, man.
It's your own fault.
Shame on you!
Useless!
Bad dog!
You there, Yoon-Ju?
- Barking again!
- Can you hear it!
Yeah, go ahead.
You have a dog or something?
You hear it too?
Sure.
God,
it's driving me nuts.
What a life!
You mongrel!
Do you like dried radishes?
What?
Yeah, I do.
Radishes should be dried in the sun.
The weather isn't helping.
Barking Dogs Never Bite
The train is approaching...
You can take my seat.
Sit over here.
Leave it.
No, 15 across.
Yeah, 15 across.
It's "Reciprocate".
What? "Reciprocal"?
Don't you know?
I don't think it's that.
Let me know if you run out of paper.
You mean 15 down?
I don't think it's 15 across
You don't know what it means, do you?
I do.
How ignorant you are!
I know what reciprocal means.
No, it's "Reciprocate".
I don't think you really know?
I'm dying for a cigarette.
It's raining.
I can't smoke on the roof.
Go smoke in the bathroom.
I'm not a kid.
You're going to shit anyway.
You think I only eat and shit?
No way! I didn't eat breakfast.
This place makes me fatter.
Hello? Hyun-nam?
What a slut!
Stamp these, please.
"Lost Dog"
If you don't get these stamped,
janitors will
take them off.
That's what I am here for.
Done!
By the way... how old are you?
I'm a 1st grader.
Shouldn't you be at school?
What for? My dog is missing.
I don't wanna study.
That's not good.
I'll post them
around the neighborhood.
You go to school.
If I don't find her,
I'll starve myself to death.
She's my life.
Oh, you're home.
I'm hungry.
Let me fix your dinner.
I don't want dinner.
This is what I want.
The people downstairs will hear.
Looks like a human brain.
I'm going out tonight.
Where?
There's a department meeting.
Jun-pyo invited me.
Jun-pyo?
You're going drinking again?
No, I won't.
I mean it.
Crack them all.
All of them?
Jesus, there are over 100 of them.
It'll take a while
50 at most.
Go ahead.
No way!
Fill this up
and you can go.
Break it up.
Hurry! The train's here!
- Okay.
- Get over here.
Fuck, when are we going home?
I wanna watch TV!
Hey!
What's the rush!
Wait for me at the next stop!
Hey!
You see the news last night?
- Oh, yeah!
- It was about the best husbands.
You know what took 1st and 2nd?
Doctors
and
lawyers.
- Your final answer?
- Yeah!
Need to ask a friend?
Miners!
That's right!
49 th is farmers
- and 50 th is...
- What?
Humanities grad students.
Is it too red?
This is our department shirt.
Not again! Another dustcloth!
It's not
very pretty.
Do we have to pay for it?
Yeah. 100 dollars.
Can I get one for free?
It includes drinks as well.
Let me pay for you.
The color isn't very good.
Did you see Jun-pyo?
I didn't see him tonight.
Who cares about where he is?
Here.
You shouldn't have.
I want to be a millionaire.
I try my best to realize my dream
no matter how hard it is.
Howevever, peace disappeared one day.
Put it down!
I could only give up my dream.
Quiet.
Jun-pyo?
Is that you, Yoon-ju?
Hello?
I'm kind of busy right now.
I'll call you back.
Where have you been?
I'm about to go home.
Thank God you're here.
Get me some tissue.
Just a second.
Here.
Did you think about what I said?
Kung-min bribed the dean
when he was studying in Germany.
That's why
he's a professor.
I'm just not a good lobbyist.
You know that?
The other night he was...
This isn't very funny.
I shouldn't be laughing.
He was
drinking with
the dean.
The dean drinks like a madman.
He gets smashed out of his gourd.
Kung-min doesn't drink.
But he got plastered that night.
Whiskey
and all.
He goes to take the subway.
Projectile vomit,
all over the tracks.
Gross!
You see the subway coming?
Even a Ph. D's head
is no match for a train.
Isn't it terrible?
That's awful!
He studied abroad and all.
What a waste.
But that's good for you.
What?
His position is available.
If you play your cards right,
it's yours.
You should go to see the dean.
I should?
Of course.
Get $10,000 ready.
$10,000?
Hey, it's not much.
Prepare it. That's what it costs.
But it's too much.
This is your last shot.
Don't let it go.
Let's go drinking.
"LostDog"
Eun-sil!
Honey!
What a girl!
Tired?
Then quit working.
Stay home and be a mom.
Stop working for peanuts.
$10,000?
You can't really call it a bribe.
Think of it as a necessary
business expense.
Okay?
Just an allowance for an old man.
What's wrong with that?
Your daddy
will be a professor.
You hear me?
Shit!
"Can't bark because of
a throat operation"
Let me take a look.
Put it nicely.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, doggy.
Putting fine timber to pretty use.
This one.
Sharpen a knife.
Go uphill to kill Jesus.
Cool...
Not here yet?
Leave a message
at the beep.
Be here in 10
or you're dead.
How's it going?
What are you doing down here?
It smells great.
You having a feast alone?
I didn't want
to dirty the office.
What soup is this?
It's nothing.
What are you
doing here?
I hate to mention it again
The other day
some kids
got caught
smoking weed
down here.
Is that right?
You didn't hear?
No.
No?
It's not that weed smoking matters
You know what's worse?
This residents' representative
stormed into my office...
...and blamed it on our janitors.
The bulb must have
blown out.
These are cheap bulbs.
When it's done,
we'll take it to the office.
Okay.
You know what?
I keep hearing noises
in this basement.
It's horrible.
It must be the pipes.
You ever heard of Boiler Kim?
Boiler Kim?
Back in 1988,
construction was booming.
Everyone wanted to
grab money out of it
Everything was built slapdash.
This apartment
was built then
later
after people moved in,
we had problems with
the heating.
So we had guys over to fix it.
But nobody knew
what was wrong.
So we called
up Boiler Kim.
Boiler Kim was
a legendary figure
in the business.
He came up all the way
from Mokpo.
He took a look
and
started to chuckle.
Then he set to work.
10 minutes later,
it was working
like a top.
And, he said
"It's spinning. "
He said like this
Spinning?
It's what they say down in Mokpo.
It was his trademark.
After he
fixed boilers,
he said,
"It's spinning" to people.
"It's spinning"
Everybody
was delighted
and wanted
to drink with him.
Then he turned
and yelled,
"You bastards!"
Everybody
was speechless.
And he asked,
"How much did you steal?"
They used
really cheap materials
and embezzled the money.
Boiler Kim
knew about it.
He fixed boilers
with love and care.
So he knew
they'd bought cheap materials.
Then
a fight
broke out.
I don't know who it was,
but somebody
pushed him back.
He fell backward...
and
there was
a nail
in the wall.
Oh!
He hit his head on the nail.
He died on the spot.
Nobody knew
what to do.
They decided to
take the secret
to their graves.
To keep the secret
They put his body
in the wall and
cemented it over.
It's the one way back there.
Over that wall,
there's a boiler room.
His body lies there
between the walls.
Here's what's even scarier.
Ever since,
it makes a noise
every night.
Every night?
No sound at all
during the day,
but it hums
at night.
Like somebody crying?
No.
Were you listening to me?
Like the way
he used to talk
"spinn-ing,
ing. "
It's done. Let's get out of here.
Oh, yes
How about the fire?
Wait!
"Boiler Kim"?
Hello...
I'm sorry to call this late.
Is this 27433733?
Yes, it is.
Mind if I ask your name?
What?
Your name?
It's Park Hyun-nam.
This is right, then!
Sorry to call at this late hour.
This is KBS TV.
What?
I'm from
"This is Your Life".
You went to elementary school
with singer Yoo Seung-jun, right?
Who?
He's looking for his first love
which is you,
Miss Park.
Yoo Seung-jun is looking for me?
We're behind schedule.
Can you come to the station?
Right now?
Would that
be possible?
What should I do?
Grab a taxi. We'll pay for it.
Is a limousine taxi okay?
You bet.
Just get yourself here quickly.
Move your ass, will you?
- Wait a second...
- What?
Why are you being so rude,
all of a sudden?
This is a crank call, idiot!
What did you do this time?
Go back to bed!
You're unbelievable.
Shut up!
Hyun-nam, are you up?
No, I'm sleeping!
Who was it?
Nobody...
Did you eat?
Jun-pyo told me that...
I didn't mean
to be late!
Enter your pin-number please.
Correct
Your balance is 100 dollars.
Press "O" for other services.
Can I have
your attention, please?
We're looking for a dog.
A white dog
with a red necklace...
two bis eyes...
had a throat operation
What's she looking for?
Dogs aren't
allowed here, right?
Yeah, that's right.
But nobody
follows the rule.
Nobody in this country
follows the rules.
Yeah, ever since the liberation.
They must be all millionaires,
raising those expensive dogs.
Right. Dogs eat
better than I do.
Let's go,
go...
Nuts!
Nuts!
Nuts...
Sweetie!
Sweetie!
Sweetie!
Sweetie!
Excuse me!
Mi-jung!
Look at you!
You look so funny in that.
I was jogging.
You live around here?
No, I teach a kid.
I've got bills to pay, you know.
I see.
What a cutie!
I didn't know you liked dogs.
Why don't we...
I love them, too.
I'm kind of...
Have a cup of coffee with me.
It's on me.
But I was jogging.
Let's...
You must have been busy lately.
- Not really.
- I know what you're up to.
I'm not busy.
I heard you'll be a professor.
Congratulations!
No, you got it wrong!
Since you'll be a professor
- You can hire me as your assistant.
- No, listen!
That will be the day.
- Listen to me.
- There's a cafe over there.
Come on.
Now here is what
was recorded on CC TV.
Here we can see...
how a female staff caught the robber.
These clips are very valuable.
They are exclusive.
Please pay attention.
We can see
the robber walking in slowly.
Did you see that?
She beat off
a bank robber.
Just like me.
She's real fighter.
What a girl!
She's tough.
That must have hurt.
What nerves she has!
Look at that! She got smacked
by the knife's handle.
Lucky it's the handle.
Wow! She's like Zena!
Why'd she bother? It's not her money.
How can you say that?
I'd have just given it to him.
I mean, it's the bank's money.
She's still fighting off the robber.
Because of her bravery...
we would like to present her...
But now she's famous.
Not everybody gets
on TV.
Let us ask her a few questions
Get a job at the bank
and catch a robber.
The bank
would never hire me.
Robbers never come here.
Boring, isn't it?
Go away!
Let's go for a smoke.
I love smoking on the roof.
The smell doesn't get on my clothes.
Did you get caught?
No.
But my aunt suspects it.
What? I can't see anything.
You only
sell cheap toys.
What's cheap?
The other way!
Oh, now it works!
Watch it. Very expensive.
I can see trees on the mountain.
What trees?
I can see them very clearly
It's a shame,
they's not good looking guys.
You want to go hiking?
Sounds good.
And have a barbeque in the forest.
Look.
There's a guy on the roof.
What's that?
What?
What's he doing?
It's a dog.
Where?
What's he doing?
What?
What can you see?
Can't you see that guy?
What's he doing?
That guy in red!
Good looking?
He must be crazy or something.
Is he taking his clothes off?
Wow!
Has he taken them off?
It's very expensive!
Oh no.
He must be...
Really good looking
Hey!
Can you give this back to him?
Let's get back to the subject.
Ask him to change it.
Where have you been?
No more mistakes, okay?
Stamp these, please.
"Lost Dog"
Granny, wait!
Just a minute!
What's that?
It's my sweetie's lunch.
Hold on a second.
Is this your dog?
Why is he sleeping here?
Where are you going?
Granny!
I want to borrow some money from you
Say $3000?
Really?
Your kids are at the hospital?
How'd he swallow a battery?!
That's terrible.
Insurance won't cover it?
The bill must be huge.
What is that?
We live in an apartment.
We can't raise a dog!
Everyone else does.
You told me yourself.
How could you
afford it?
It's not expensive.
We don't have money to waste!
I'm the one who's earning it.
What?
Shut up and do these.
This is my sweetie's lunch.
Thanks for your help.
I could never
do it myself.
Good thing you called me.
Don't worry.
You can go back to the office.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, go ahead.
Let me have a look.
Fresh
feels good.
Quite heavy.
Okay, let me take a rest
Sharpen a knife.
Go uphill to kill Jesus.
Better put same salt.
None left?
Damn it.
Taste good.
Taste better with this.
Time to eat.
Where's my dog?
Pets aren't good for pregnant women.
They shed hair, and carry viruses.
If you keep them clean, it's okay.
So you clean up after her.
Got it?
Why don't we give her to my dad?
They have a yard and...
That again!
I said no!
Oh, no!
We forgot to buy strawberry milk.
She drinks it
every night.
Go get it for me.
You want me to go back to the store?
You want me to go?
I have to go back to
the store for that mongrel?
It's 100 meters from here.
Stop exaggerating.
It's not 100 meters.
More like 50 meters.
Hurry up.
Stop right there.
You think I'm nothing?
You want to fight?
It's at least 100 meters.
You want to bet on it?
Bet on it?
Yeah, sure!
If it's over 100 meters,
we're sending her to my dad's.
How about that?
If it's less than 100?
If not...
Respect me from now on.
What?
I'm 2 years older than you.
You're on!
Watch.
This is 1 meter.
2,
3,
4, 5, 6...
You gonna go all the way
back to the store?
Just get me the milk.
What, are you exercising?
You're like a kid.
So silly!
100 meters.
Hey.
He must be a bum or something.
He plays with the dogs
'cause he's got nothing else to do.
Don't get yourself drunk.
Don't want to waste it.
If I hadn't hit that door...
Thank God the door stopped you.
Why?
He'd have beaten you up
otherwise.
He looked really weak from behind.
If we'd gotten
into a fist fight,
I'd have knocked him out.
Then you'd have made the news.
"Maintenance girl
catches murderer red-handed. "
Right?
I'd have gotten
a reward
from the mayor.
You must be out of your mind.
Have you ever fought?
Have I?
First you grab a guy.
Then you trip him
and get on
top of him!
Be careful!
How can you win?
I'm heavier than you
And grab him by the arms.
And break them.
Are you sleeping?
Honey?
Honey?
Be quiet! You woke baby up.
Baby?
I just named her baby.
Baby...
Scratch my back.
You know what?
Some professors
got arrested for taking bribes.
Scratch it harder.
They used banks to wire money.
They should have used shoe boxes.
Nobody would have
found out.
I thought I just needed to study hard
to become a professor.
But I was wrong.
What'll the dean do with that money?
Go back to sleep.
If I ever become a professor,
I'll never take money.
Turn off the light, will you?
Can you get arrested
for giving bribes, too?
You don't have
any money to give them.
Hello?
It's me.
What's up?
Did you feed baby?
I haven't eaten myself yet.
What are you yelling for?
If you bother her,
you're dead.
Okay, I won't!
Don't be such a couch potato.
Walk the dog or something!
Attention! Attention please!
To keep the community hygienic,
we will start clearing
and pest control.
Please give us your support.
Because work is being carried out
please stay home and...
avoid the park area.
Good health to you all.
Please keep our community tidy.
Thank you.
"Lottery-$10,000"
Baby!
Baby!
Baby!
Baby!
Listen, I'll leave you alone
from now on
Take care
I'm going, bye.
Did you eat?
Where's baby?
Didn't you take her out?
Well...
I lost her.
You did something with her,
didn't you?
What do you mean?
Be honest with me.
You dumped her, didn't you?
She just disappeared
in the park.
Don't lie to me!
I'm not lying!
I looked everywhere for her.
But to my failure.
Go find her!
She's disappeared!
You fucker!
You know what she means to me?
You bitch!
Ki-jung became a professor.
So did Ju-hyun.
Who do you think you are?
I'm desperate for pennies,
and you bought that dog?
And eat walnuts all the time?
You idiot!
You know...
what she is?
What? What is she?
I bought her with my retirement pay.
You think it's easy
for pregnant women
to keep a job?
11 years with the company,
and all I get is $13,000.
Did I buy anything that I wanted?
I paid $300 for her!
And you're shouting at me.
I was going to use the rest
to make you a professor.
What was I thinking?
Can I make some copies?
To be honest,
there were two others before you.
Dogs have been...
Hello?
The hospital?
How is granny?
What?
This morning?
No,
I'm not related to her.
I just put my name there...
I don't know anyone from her family.
Have you seen Baby?
So she lived alone
with that dog?
I shouldn't have
let her see the body.
Yeah, bright move.
I meant well for her.
Everybody dies sometime.
Hey! You told me she was sick.
It's not your fault.
Whoever killed her dog,
he is to blame.
Shouldn't let him off.
Right. We need to find him.
What a fucking asshole.
I'll take his clothes off...
then throw him out
So
you almost caught him?
I almost did.
Did you see...
his face?
No. Only from behind.
I almost touched him in the back.
He's kind of tall.
About your size.
How long have you been doing this?
Since last night.
All night long?
If I don't find Soon-ja today,
I'm dead.
You must really love that dog.
That dog is better than me.
Oh, it's the office.
Go ahead.
Sorry for
leaving you.
I'll help more later.
Cheer up. You'll find her.
Go.
How are you?
Good.
What's the hurry?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing down here?
Can I borrow that bucket?
What for?
I'm washing my car.
But,
you don't have a car.
Let me borrow it.
I said no, didn't I?
Don't push me!
It's just a bucket!
What's wrong with you?
Let me borrow it!
Get your hands off me!
Give it to me!
Go away!
Give it to me!
- Don't!
- Give it to me!
What's wrong with you?
There are lots of things
for you to do.
And you gone missing all the time.
You messed up the bills.
So there was a big problem.
And where do you go
when you're on duty?
I never see you at the office
unless I page you.
You don't even have a mobile phone.
What if there's urgent matters!
You're not the only
office assistant in the world.
There are thousands of girls
who want your position.
Excuse me.
Who's Miss Park Hyun-nam?
Granny told me about you
before she died.
She asked me to give this to you.
Open it.
You can have my dried radishes
on the roof, my dear.
It's that dog!
That's just right.
Make it shorter.
About right.
I'm so hungry tonight.
My stomach is rumbling.
Should be okay now.
The fire is ready.
Hold it the other way round.
Let me do it.
I can't do it like this.
Hold it
with its ass
toward me.
And I'll push it in.
That's it.
Jesus, it's hairy.
Okay, give it to me.
Get ready...
Are you ready?
Here I come!
Open the door!
Anybody?... Open the door!
This isn't the first time
you've done this.
Where do you live?
Jang-mi! Up here!
Quick... hurry!
Is that your dog?
No.
Then we can eat it together.
I'll strangle you...
Let me strangle you bastard.
News broadcast.
Sis, talking about your case.
That's what you were talking about.
Quiet!
This is incredible!
That's him!
He was caught by a resident
before he killed another dog.
Served him right!
Can't see you there?
He is said to have been
seen around the complex.
As you can see,
he was living here
in the basement...
but not even
the janitors were aware of it.
Sometimes I'll came and check.
I'm a responsible person.
It's blinking.
Fix the antenna.
Can only see a lot of rubbish.
Who could possibly imagine
anybody living down there?
It's an awkward situation
for me.
The police requested a warrant
for his arrest.
He's also under investigation
for other crimes.
I can have pork for lunch,
fish for dinner.
I like it in prison.
They are arresting me.
But... I...
I'm not afraid.
When you are coming on?
Because he keeps changing
his story in the interrogation...
...the police arranged
a mental test for him tomorrow.
Thank you for watching.
You said you'd be on?
I did an interview.
You're a liar!
No!
They must have edited you out.
Why only me?
My husband left home.
Because of my pneumonia
I wasn't able to continue my work.
I need to take care of my son.
Your little help will save our life.
Hyun-nam?
Let's get plastered today.
Come on!
Go buy some more beer!
No more beer!
You go!
You go!
You go!
Hurry up!
What are you doing here?
Let me carry you.
How do you feel?
Are you alright?
Get up!
My savior!
You're drunk, too?
Just a little bit.
I should take all these down!
Just go home.
Read this.
"Will be given a big reward. "
I should reward you.
Or take you to a fancy restaurant.
Really?
Tomorrow I'll drop...
by the office.
OK?
I got fired.
They said
I should be a street vendor
cause I like being outside.
I was going to quit anyway.
I want to go hiking in the mountains.
Hyun-nam!
I have something to confess.
What is it?
Look at me closely.
Look at me from behind.
Don't I look familiar?
What?
Look at the back of my head.
Doesn't this
remind you of anything?
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
Once we ran together like this.
Don't you remember?
What are you talking about?
Yes,
it was me!
One of your shoes is missing.
It's all set, sir.
Today...
we'll look at some charts
on modern behaviorism.
Close the curtains, please.
