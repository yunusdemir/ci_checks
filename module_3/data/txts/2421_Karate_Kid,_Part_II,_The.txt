Hey, wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?
Man who catch fly with chopstick,
accomplish anything.
- You ever catch one?
- Not yet.
What was that you were doing
on those stumps over there?
- Called Crane Technique.
- Does it work?
- lf do right, no can defense.
- Could you teach me?
First learn stand, then learn fly.
Nature rule, Daniel-san. Not mine.
- Where'd you learn it from?
- Father teach.
- You must have had some father, man.
- Oh, yes.
"Valor."
Johnny, leave him alone, man.
He's had enough!
- I'll decide when he's had enough, man.
- What is wrong with you, Johnny?
- An enemy deserves no mercy.
- Right!
- No mercy!
- Right!
You're crazy, man!
Tommy, Bobby, get him!
Mercy is for the weak.
Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he is the enemy.
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?
Come on, let's forget this.
Wait. Not yet.
Time out! Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel.
Johnny, you're a cream puff!
Sweep the leg.
You have a problem with that?
No, Sensei.
No mercy.
It's over, Johnny! Yeah! You did it!
LaRusso, are you okay? Can you go on?
Get him a body bag! Yeah!
- All right, feet.
- Do it again, Johnny!
That's a warning
for illegal contact to the knee.
Finish it! No mercy!
No mercy! Way to finish, Johnny!
Finish him!
Fight!
Winner!
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, you know, I was thinking.
About what, Daniel-san?
That maybe we should have
a strategy now, you know?
For what?
My future. My whole tournament career.
Miyagi already have one.
Really? What is it?
Early retirement.
Ali and mother wait for us at restaurant.
Yeah, I know. I'm starving.
- That was great. Real good.
- Thank you.
Danny LaRusso, very impressive win, son.
- You showed a lot of poise under pressure.
- All right. Thanks.
People are gonna be talking about
that last kick for years. Congratulations.
Out of my way!
- Hey, man, what you doing to the brother?
- Don't play with me.
Excuse me.
Why does he act like that?
That guy just doesn't know
what karate's all about.
Yeah, well, maybe he should learn.
- Would you like to teach him?
- No.
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Thanks.
- Take care.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Keep ladies waiting.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- What?
- Can we have your autograph?
- Can we get an autograph?
All right! Yeah, man!
- So, how you guys doing?
- Great.
Oh, yeah? Where are you from?
- Reseda.
- You're from...
I'm from Reseda.
I moved there a couple months ago.
- Maybe we'll see you sometime.
- All right.
- Daniel-san.
- What?
Come. Getting late.
It's the price of fame, Mr. Miyagi.
Gotta get used to it.
Take it easy. Maybe I'll see you.
Hey, come on. That's not fair.
I got second place.
Second place? Second place is no place!
You're off the team!
- That sucks. I did my best.
- What did you say?
- I said I did my best.
- You're nothing! You lost. You're a loser!
- No. You're the loser, man.
- Ohh... I'm the loser, huh?
Yeah.
- Now who's the loser?
- You know, you're really sick, man.
- Hey!
- Hey, come on!
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Don't!
How does second place feel now, huh?
- Come on! He can't breathe!
- Mind your business.
- You're gonna kill him!
- Sensei, please.
You're hurting him.
He's sorry, okay? He really is.
- Oi, let him go.
- Mr. Miyagi's right.
Let him go!
I say, let him go!
Beat it, slope, or you're next.
Mercy is for the weak.
We do not train to be merciful here.
A man face you, he is enemy.
Enemy deserve no mercy.
No.
Honk!
Daniel-san, ladies no wait forever.
You could've killed him, couldn't you?
- Hai.
- Well, why didn't you then?
Because, Daniel-san, for person
with no forgiveness in heart,
living even worse punishment than death.
Oh, Daniel-san,
must have been some senior prom.
- What happened?
- You mean, what didn't happen.
First I let Ali borrow the car,
and she redesigns my fender.
And I don't know what she did to the engine,
but that ain't running right, either.
And you know what else she does?
She tells me that she's just fallen in love
with some football player from UCLA.
- Why didn't she just lie?
- Things could be worse.
Yeah, well, don't worry about it. They are.
Last night, I find out my mom
got picked by a company to go to Fresno.
Two months. We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I gotta spend my whole summer in Fresno.
You're not gonna be able to fix that.
How'd you do that?
What'd you do?
- Come. Miyagi tell you later.
- Where we going?
I have just the thing make you feel better.
- Probably got work for me to do.
- Hit nail on head.
Yeah, well, how come every time I have
a problem, you have work for me to do?
- Cosmic coincidence.
- When'd you build this?
Daniel-san, watch.
Come. Take off jacket. You try.
Must focus.
Concentrate.
Focus. Most important.
I can't, Mr. Miyagi, not today, all right?
I'm just not in the mood.
- Why?
- Because my whole life
is going out of focus, that's why.
When you feel life out of focus,
always return to basic of life.
What, praying?
Breathing.
No breathe, no life.
Come try.
Out of mouth. Breathe in through nose.
Breathe out of mouth.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Now how feel?
Better. More focused.
Good. Come back to work.
- Hey, I did it.
- Good focus, Daniel-san.
Remember, breathe in, breathe out.
In,
out.
In,
out.
In,
out.
Very good work.
Daniel-san.
Daniel-san!
Oi!
Yeah. I'll be right there.
- How feel?
- Much better. Thanks.
What am I building out there, anyway?
- Guest room.
- You expecting company?
Refugee.
Refugee?
Oh, yeah? That's great. From where?
Fresno.
Fresno?
Miyagi talk to mother last night, too.
- And she said I could stay in here?
- lf like.
- You mean I don't have to go to Fresno?
- lf no want.
Oh, man, you saved my life!
Thanks! Mr. Miyagi, thanks.
Welcome.
- Iced tea.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, no, wait. Look.
I made this for you. It's rosewood.
I thought it'd be nice to show them off.
Daniel-san, thank you for gift,
but why show off?
Well, you know,
it says something about you,
winning the Medal of Honor and all that.
It says you're brave. I thought it'd be neat.
This say you brave.
This say you lucky.
- Mr. My-aji live here?
- Oh, excuse me.
- "Miyagi."
- Excuse <i>me</i>.
Mr. Miyagi. Registered letter
for you, sir, from Okinawa.
Okinawa?
Yes, sir. Would you sign here, please?
Hey, this is some place you have here.
From the outside yard, you'd never know it.
You should charge admission.
My missus loves this stuff.
You mind if I bring her by
sometime to see it?
Some other time, maybe.
Mr. Miyagi?
What is it?
My father.
He very sick.
Your father?
I didn't even know he was still alive.
How come you can get
a passport in one day?
Have next-day plane ticket.
You know, you never told me. Why'd you
ever leave Okinawa in the first place?
Fall in love with girl.
So? Why'd you leave?
Was arranged by her parents
she marry someone else.
Well, did you ever meet the guy?
What was he like?
Was Miyagi best friend.
So this is your old girlfriend, Yukie?
She sent the letter?
And this is your buddy?
My best buddy, Sato.
- You think he's still alive?
- We were same age.
What did he do when
he found out about you two?
Challenge Miyagi to fight.
Must've been some girl.
Miyagi remember.
I make big speech
in front of whole village.
Miyagi break with tradition,
go against parent arrangement.
Marry Yukie anyway.
Of course, Sato feel disgrace.
So, challenge Miyagi to fight
to save his honor.
And you lost?
No.
Never fight.
Next day, leave Okinawa forever.
Well, what about her? Didn't you love her?
- Very much.
- Well, did she love you?
- So, then how could you leave?
- Miyagi no believe in fighting.
Yeah, I know that,
but you guys were in love. Come on.
Daniel-san,
never put passion before principle.
Even if win, you lose.
You think they got married?
Sato, his family was richest in village.
Yukie's was poorest.
Was good arrangement.
Yeah, well, it was 45 years ago.
He shouldn't be angry
about his honor anymore.
Daniel-san,
in Okinawa, honor have no time limit.
Are you serious?
In Okinawa, honor very serious.
I guess I'd better get going.
I gotta go help my mom pack.
I'll stop by tomorrow, okay, Mr. Miyagi?
Taxi leave 6:00 p.m.
- Yeah, I'll be here by then.
- Daniel-san,
Miyagi sorry things not work out.
That's no problem. I hope your dad's okay.
You're cutting it pretty close, mister.
- Go airport.
- All right.
Have a good flight. Nice to see you.
- Hello.
- Good evening.
You will be in seat 32-B.
- Enjoy the flight.
- Hey, Mr. Miyagi!
Wait up! I'm coming with you!
My mother said it's okay.
I mean, if it's okay with you.
Very expensive ticket.
Well, no, no, no. I got the money out
of my savings account. It's all taken care of.
Savings for college education.
So I'll get a job when we get back,
and I'll go six months late.
It really doesn't make a difference when I go.
- Night jobs very hard to find.
- Yeah, I know.
I mean, Mr. Miyagi,
you're more important than college.
You're more important than anything to me.
I mean...
When I need you,
you're always there for me.
I just... I really wanna go,
and if it's okay with you, I'd like to go.
Daniel-san, don't think good idea.
No, no. It'll give me a chance
to study Okinawan history up close.
- Come on.
- Never know you study that.
I just started.
- Come on.
- We're closing the doors.
Come on. Please.
I'm afraid you'll have to go back to the gate,
young man.
Young man coming with us.
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.
No, Daniel-san. Thank you.
Hope you don't get airsick.
What do you mean "airsick"?
What's airsick?
You know the biggest U.S. air base
in the Pacific is on Okinawa?
What's the name of your village again?
Tomi Village.
I can't find it.
Find Naha?
Yeah, I know where Naha is.
Go south, along the sea.
Find Tomi Village.
I keep running into the air base.
Daniel-san,
you look again morning.
Maybe Tomi Village be there.
Get some sleep.
Mr. Miyagi?
Was Sato as good as you in karate?
Have same teacher.
Your father? He taught both of you?
I thought you said your family's karate
was only taught from father to son.
Miyagi ask father make exception this case.
If you fought Sato, you think
your father would have been referee?
No referee.
How do you know who wins?
The one who dead doesn't.
It's pretty weird having somebody
go through my stuff like that.
I'm glad I didn't have any dirty laundry.
Was this place here when you left?
Miyagi leave Okinawa by boat.
No airport Okinawa at that time.
You know, I kept looking through my book.
I still can't find your village on a map.
How are we gonna find it?
Ask taxi.
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, isn't that him?
Hey, can you break a log like that?
Don't know. Never been attacked by tree.
Miyagi-san!
It is great honor. I am Chozen Toguchi.
Yukie-san say sorry
she could not meet you herself.
We have a car waiting for you.
Car?
Please.
You speak very good English, Toguchi-san.
In Okinawa, it help to speak
very good English.
My friend and student, Daniel LaRusso.
Thank you.
- You karate student, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hello. Welcome to Okinawa.
- Thanks.
I hope your stay here is a pleasant one.
How you know I be here today?
Okinawa very small place.
Village south.
Why, please, we go north now?
Some things have changed
since you go, Miyagi-san.
And some things have not, eh?
Out!
- What's going on?
- No talking!
Uncle!
Sato.
So, coward, you return.
To settle affairs with father.
And with me.
Sato, I no fight you.
Then you die as you have lived,
a coward!
You see your father,
then you see me!
- What are you gonna do?
- Find taxi.
No. About Sato.
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing.
All this because you had to go and tell
everybody you were gonna marry Yukie?
Why didn't you just marry her
and, and... move to Alaska?
Daniel-san, nobody perfect.
- Where you going, buddy?
- Tomi Village.
Tomi Village? Never heard of it.
This is Kadena Air Base.
Sarge, Tomi Village?
You're standing on it, Corporal!
Get them out of here!
Right. Just take that road and make a right.
Daniel-san,
Miyagi remember first time
father teach fishing,
right off this point.
Was 1927.
Was much quieter then.
- Thanks a lot.
- Hai.
Take off shoe.
Miyagi-san!
Auntie Yukie said you would come.
Yukie... Where is she?
- Nursing your father.
- Domo.
- Hi. I'm Daniel.
- Hi. I am Kumiko.
- Please.
- Thank you.
He sleeping.
Yukie,
how you know where to find me?
I've known for many years.
Why you never write sooner?
Out of respect.
- For husband.
- No.
For your silence.
I never marry.
What did he say?
"If I am dreaming, let me never awake.
"If I am awake, let me never sleep."
Good morning.
Ohayo gozaimasu.
You're Yukie.
- You Daniel-san.
- Yes.
Mr. Miyagi's told me a lot about you.
And he tell me lot about you.
- There's not that much to tell.
- Oh, no.
He very proud of you.
Well...
How's his father feeling?
Very tired.
Miyagi Sensei in dojo.
- Thank you.
- Hai.
See you later.
- Good morning, Daniel-san.
- Good morning.
- Welcome to Miyagi family dojo. You like?
- It's great.
This is really something.
Who are all these guys?
All the Miyagi ancestor, 400 year worth.
And who's that?
That is Miyagi Shimpo Sensei.
First Miyagi bring karate to Okinawa.
The one who went to China.
1625.
- I forgot. How did he get there? By boat?
- By accident.
Like all Miyagi,
Shimpo Sensei was fisherman.
Love fishing. Love sake.
One day, strong wind, strong sun,
strong sake, but no fish.
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep
off coast of Okinawa,
wake up off coast of China.
Ten year later, he come back
with Chinese wife and two kids
and secret of Miyagi family karate.
This is the secret of your family's karate?
- I don't get it.
- Practice. You will. Come. We go work.
- What are these things?
- This rules to karate.
Rule number one, karate for defense only.
Rule number two,
first learn rule number one.
- Daniel-san.
- Yeah, coming.
God, this looks like the town
that time forgot.
Yeah.
I think we went school together.
I would introduce you, but I forget name.
How come if this is a fishing village,
I don't see anybody fishing?
Yukie-san tell me last night.
After war, Sato father bring
in big commercial fishing boat.
Inside two year, all fish gone.
All small boat gone.
Almost everything gone, except old cannery.
And lots of memories. Ichiro.
When I left, he was same place,
doing same thing, playing same tune.
That's a shrine, right?
Shinto shrine.
Boy, it must've been tough times
with all the fish gone, huh?
Very tough.
Most people leave village for city,
look for work.
My father, some others,
invent whole new economy.
Go into vegetable business,
save what was left of village.
So, what?
So, everyone owns their own little farm?
No. Sato own. Village rent.
- That's a bummer.
- You're right. Familiar face.
After school,
Kumiko teach O-Bon dance to kids.
O-Bon dance. O-Bon dance.
It's for the festival
in honor of the dead, right?
Very good, Daniel-san.
Yeah, I remember reading about it last night.
What is that, a pillbox?
Probably left over from World War II.
Boy, it must've been terrible here.
15,000 Americans killed in like 10 days.
Yeah. And 150,000 Okinawan and Japanese.
Why we all so stupid?
You have seen father?
Hai.
Then we finish tonight.
I bring a nephew for witness.
Then you and nephew both
lose sleep tonight. I not be there.
Your teacher coward!
You leave me no choice.
- Wait a second.
- Daniel-san.
Miyagi-sensei, Miyagi-sensei!
Your father, he want you.
And you, too.
Out of respect for my teacher,
I give you three days to mourn.
When finish, I come back.
You prepare to join him.
You know, when my father died,
I spent a lot of time
thinking I wasn't such a great son.
Like, maybe I could have listened
a little more,
or spent some more time with him together.
I felt so guilty, you know, like...
Like, he did everything for me
and I didn't do anything for him.
And then one day I realized, I did
the greatest thing for him before he died.
I was there with him,
and I held his hand,
and I said goodbye.
Hyah!
Very good, Daniel-san. Time for next lesson.
All right!
You know, I don't get something.
If Sato hates you so much,
why does he give you time to mourn?
My father was his teacher.
Inside the heart,
Sato still know right from wrong.
- But he still wants to kill you.
- Sometime what heart know, head forget.
Yeah, but the guy's looking to go to war.
I don't understand.
Never stop war by taking part in one.
Yeah, I know.
But what if he threw that punch over there?
- What would you have done?
- Block.
You think you could've?
- Even you could have.
- I'm not that strong.
Not matter who's stronger.
Matter who's smarter.
- I guess that's why I won the tournament.
- Good guess, Daniel-san.
From very first karate lesson,
Miyagi father always say,
"Best way to avoid punch, no be there."
- I don't get it.
- Miyagi say same thing until I work here.
Miyagi first job, work for Sato father.
One day, Miyagi mind on something
other than fish when empty net return.
- That was a little close.
- Drum technique. Understand?
- Ah, yeah!
- Drum technique.
Yeah, let me try.
Ehh...
Oh, come on. Just one turn, please.
Oh, come on, you gotta. Just one turn.
- Please?
- Okay, come platform.
- Great.
- I go pull up hook.
Father say use drum technique
only as last resort.
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Remember, best block, no be there.
- Okay.
One, two, three!
Whoa!
- Daniel-san, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Come. Enough for today.
Try again tomorrow.
You know,
Miyagi and Yukie have first date here.
Remember like was yesterday.
Happen over load of fresh mackerel.
Daniel-san, you all right?
Yeah. I'm sorry. That was pretty stupid.
Miyagi say that to father
when same thing happened.
Father agree it was stupid. Father was right.
Hey, is there a counterpunch
in the technique?
Ask drum.
Come, Daniel-san, talk to drum later.
- That guy's uncle own everything?
- Almost.
Hey! There's Miyagi the coward.
And his baby!
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Why should it?
All the people might believe it's true
or something.
Daniel-san, lie become truth only
if person want to believe it.
- Is that another old Okinawan saying?
- No. New Okinawa saying.
How new?
About 10 seconds.
- Hey! Hey, are you okay?
- Hai.
I'll get it.
N-ninji...
Carrots, right?
C-carrot? Ninji.
- Ichiro.
- Daniel.
- Daniel?
- Yes.
Harigato.
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Your little teacher should get hearing aid.
- Maybe you need one, too.
- I only hear what's worth listening to.
Come on, we are working here.
What is this?
So, you cheat people?
- Shame! Shame!
- You cheat! You cheat!
We'll talk sometime
when you're not so busy.
You still remember our song?
Hai.
Sing for me.
- Yukie, I no sing long time.
- Please. Please.
We were so young then.
Yukie, why you never marry?
You never come back.
You knew I would not.
Yes, I knew.
My father,
he ever tell you about
how he feel when I leave?
One time.
He say he love you very much
and what you did was right.
Except for one thing.
I should have taken you with me.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I am disturbing you?
- What? No, no, not at all.
What are you doing?
- I was just practicing some moves. See?
- What are moves?
Well, it's like karate.
I'm trying to figure this thing out here.
Looks like O-Bon dance.
Well, then I must be doing
something wrong.
No, no, no. Doing something right. Look.
- Wow. Where'd you learn that?
- From my auntie.
- That's terrific.
- You try.
No, not me.
I was absent the day they taught graceful.
- You were what?
- Forget it. It's just a bad joke.
- I'll try it. I'll try.
- Good.
Wait a sec. Okay.
Right and left.
Hey, look at this. We're a hit.
Maybe we could take it on the road.
But we are on the road.
You dance very nice. Like geisha.
Come on, Daniel-san, let's go.
His little teacher's favorite technique, huh?
"Let's go."
Hey, come on.
Give me the drum back, please.
- You mean the baby rattle?
- Come on.
- Why don't baby come take it back?
- Oh, man...
Hey, man!
Daniel-san, are you okay?
You insult my honor again,
and I kill you.
You keep for your collection.
I know you like it.
- Are you all right, Daniel-san?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
He cheats these people
and I'm insulting his honor. I don't get it.
- He has no idea what honor is.
- Yeah, I kind of got that feeling.
Ever since we were children,
he has always been the same.
This is the first time I ever had somebody
ever tell me they're gonna kill me.
This is ridiculous.
I gotta go talk to him or something.
He would only take it as a sign of weakness
and only try to hurt you again.
You got any ideas?
Avoid him.
I think I'm on the wrong island.
- What's going on here?
- Tea ceremony.
I guess it's an old ritual or something.
It means that they are falling in love again.
- Daniel-san.
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Been here trying to fix refrigerator.
- What's wrong with it?
This. Gotta go Naha City for new part.
You like come?
I was supposed to go sightseeing
with Kumiko,
- but I can go.
- Okay.
- You go, have a good time.
- No, no, we could go tomorrow.
- No, I see you later.
- It's no big deal.
But we don't have plans.
There's nothing set.
Daniel-san, never keep lady waiting.
I'll remember that. I'll see you later.
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.
Be careful.
- This reminds me of the Palisades.
- Palisades? Where's that?
- It's in New Jersey, where I used to live.
- Is it pretty?
Some of it.
There it is!
The ruins of the castle of King Sho Hashi.
The Peace King.
- You know King Sho Hashi?
- Not personally.
Name of it is...
Now Sato owns it.
In old days, O-Bon dance was held here,
but no more.
Now every piece goes away.
Sato, he sells it to museums.
Sounds like him.
Legend is, if you race up to the castle
and win, your wish will come true.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- I'll give you a head start.
- Not necessary, thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Ready, set, go!
Hey!
- I won!
- You cheated! And you know you did.
- We'll share the wish.
- Okay.
Close your eyes.
Hey, you know what I really wanna know?
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
What do you wanna do?
What are your dreams?
Okay, I'll show you my dream.
You know, I still can't get used to people
driving on the wrong side of the street.
- What side of the street do you drive on?
- On the right side, you know.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, everybody drives
on the right side of the street.
- Not everybody.
- Well, that's what I'm learning.
- So, what? You want to sell TVs for a living?
- No.
What? Interested in electronics?
I don't understand.
No. There.
That is my dream.
- Oh, you want to be a dancer.
- Very much.
Well, that's a great thing to be.
So, where do you study?
No schools for this kind of dancing
in Okinawa.
What a drag.
Kumiko-chan, come to the dance tonight.
Oh, bring your friend.
- Okay.
- Good. See you there.
- Like to go to dance?
- Sure. That's Sato's dojo.
- Hey, I want to check that out. Come on.
- Not inside. Chozen teaches in there.
Hey, I'm not gonna go inside.
I just wanna see, you know.
Look through the window. He won't see me.
- He teach American military police in there.
- Really?
You must learn to move very quickly.
- He's not bad.
- He's Sato's number-one student.
- I can see why.
- We must go. He may see you.
Hey, you know,
maybe we'll run into Mr. Miyagi out here.
Why would he be here?
He said he had to come into town to get
a part for his refrigerator or something.
I know that store. It's right around corner.
Maybe we will see him.
- What's going on in here?
- This bad place. We don't want to go in here.

- Yeah! I got 40!
- This guy's standing wrong.
- See? I told you. You gotta use your hip.
- But he looks so strong.
No, you gotta be strong here, not here.
It doesn't make a difference.
Why, you think you can do better,
big mouth, huh?
You think you can do better? Drop some ice.
- I don't know.
- Then let us find out, huh?
- Maybe some other time.
- There is no other time!
Listen, whatever problems Mr. Miyagi has
with your uncle, they don't have to be ours.
- Let me out of here.

- Hey, Kumiko, where are you going?
- You go nowhere!
Call my uncle. You will take a bet.
Yosh!
I give three to one, eh?
What? No, no, no, I'm not doing it!

- Your fear make air stink.
What has happened to you?
Isn't this great?
Yeah, it's nice.
Are you still worried about

Well, you see,

And all this stuff, I feel so helpless.
Nothing you can do.
Yeah. I guess.
Can you dance like this?
I can try.

- I think so.
Hey, you're very good.

Want to get something to drink?
Sit down or something?
Okay.

She must be a good teacher.
Yeah, she's great. Have a seat.

Whoever I marry is up to me.
Well, that's good.

What is free agent?
Well, that just means that I'm available.

Come here. I want to show you something.
Your sensei teach you
how to fight with spear, huh?
No.
Too bad.
Maybe he teach you how to be coward.
Hey, Mr. Coward.
Leave message.
This your teacher's fault.
If he were man with honor, you would live.
But he's not.
Enough!
Uncle problem with Miyagi, not with boy.
No, you have problem, old man, with me.
Act of coward!
Daniel-san, you okay?
He was really gonna kill me.
Come.
Miyagi make tea. Make you feel better.
Tomorrow we go home.
I did not want for us to end this way again.
I would stay if I could.
I know.
Yukie, what can I do to ease your pain?
Take me with you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What you doing?
Old custom.
When fishermen would go out to sea,
families would offer rice to the gods.
For a good catch?
For a quick return.
Thought any more about dance school?
I told you. No schools for that here.
Well, there are in the States.
My home is here.
Home is where you hang your hat.
You think I would like America?
I think you would love it.
Do you think it would love me?
Well, I know one part of it that already does.

- Let's go see.
Okay, come on.

Why?
Why you think?
You will destroy village?
No, you will!
You win.
I fight you.
One condition.
No matter who win,
title to land pass to village forever.
Haha, you ask for too much.
Hah!
Small price to pay for your honor.
You're right. Small price.
I see you here midnight.
Miyagi, I wait long time for this.
No tricks tonight,
or tomorrow everything gone!
Their homes, their church,
Everything! Gone!
What's this?
Last will and testament.
Yukie get house here.
You get house and pickup back home.
No, I don't want the house
and a pickup back home. I want you.
Can't we call this off?
Why don't we just leave?
lmpossible, Daniel-san.
Just forget about the honor garbage.
Have nothing to do with honor garbage.
This have to do with village survival.
This isn't three points and you're out.
If you lose, I know what happens.
Miyagi already win.
No matter what happen, village safe forever.
So, is this seat taken?

How're they gonna recover from this?
All the seeds are gone. The place is wrecked.

- Best they can.
What is all this? What's Sato doing here?
Don't know.
I come help rebuild.
Here deed to village.
Forgive me. I beg you.
Sato, nothing to forgive.
Hey, now's a good time to ask him.
It is not my place.
Mr. Sato, you know, O-Bon dance is soon,
and it's gonna be real hard, the way
things are, to have it here in the village.
What you ask of me?
Well, can they have it in the castle?
That's where it really belongs
anyway, isn't it?
Your student become my teacher.
O-Bon will be held in castle.
Now and forever!
One condition.
You dance with us.
Well, you got it.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
See, you put your mind to it,
anything can happen.
You're right.
You know, if it wasn't for you,
I'd be making a lot of mistakes.
If not for you, I not be here.
Now remember,
you have nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried. I think I'm scared.
Are you kidding? I've seen you do it.
You're gonna be terrific. It's true.
- Listen, did I tell you you look beautiful?
- No.
Well, you do.
I've seen her practice. She's really amazing.
Behind you!
Kumiko!
Get back!
- Get back or I'll kill her!
- Chozen!
Don't do this.
I was wrong.
Hate is wrong.
- It's over.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.
I am dead to you, remember, huh?
Chozen, you are your uncle's finest student.
No disgrace him here.
Your student disgrace me.
I have been dishonored all because of him.
For whatever happened, I apologize.
Apology will not give me back my honor!
- Well, neither will this.
- In their eyes it will.
No more talk. You cross bridge, or I kill her!
Daniel-san,
this not tournament. This for real.
Now!
No bridge.
Now I dropped the bridge. Let her go.
- Come on!
- Now we fight to death!
