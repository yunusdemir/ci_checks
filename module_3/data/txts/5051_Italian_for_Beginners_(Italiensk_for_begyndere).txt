Italian for Beginners
And this is it, straight ahead.
Things haven't been easy
of late.
We feel we perhaps haven't felt
God's presence very much.
We'll make sure we clean it.
Pastor Wredmann salivates a lot
during sermons.
He can be very... committed.
Here you are.
They fit the main door as well.
I can't give you the keys
to the Vicarage.
Pastor Wredmann is only
on suspension.
So, he still lives there.
I am so sorry about your wife.
I think I knew her.
I did community service
at the pastoral seminary.
Would you like to talk to him?
... Yes, please.
Hello.
Who is he?
... I was just showing him round.
I am the temporary pastor.
My name is Andreas.
We've been looking forward
to your arrival.
Shall I help you find a bed
for the night?
Yes, please.
We'll have to sack the manager
of the stadium restaurant.
Halvfinn?
Pernille, do take some gateau.
Yes, Halvfinn.
We've had another call.
Not a complaint?
He's no idea
how to treat patrons.
He poured a chocolate milk
into a lady's handbag,
deliberately.
Opinions differ on that.
I remember one match...
Give him the sack.
Pernille, come to my office.
I believe they phoned
from the church.
Yes, I'm sorry.
It's because he is
my best friend.
The man you were talking to?
No, the man he told me to sack.
One can't just do that, can one?
No, if it's your best friend,
it is a bit problematical.
He was brought up
in an orphanage
and made the stadium his home...
but from that
to giving him the sack...
Yes, it's a bit tough.
Now I'm wondering if you
wouldn't prefer an eco-room?
The same price...
but the materials are different
and there's a view
of the allotment gardens
and not the hospital.
That's room number 531.
Here you go.
... Thanks.
Have you any luggage
I can help you with?
It's in the car.
N 0 problem.
It's a black Maserati.
Maserati...
<i>is an Italian car.</i>
<i>My name is Jorgen Mortensen.</i>
Andreas.
Welcome to the hotel, Andreas.
Thank you.
<i>Eight "Roman loaves"
for the stadium restaurant.</i>
Rum truffles, you mean?
Eight rum truffles
for the stadium restaurant.
We've got rum Danish?
Hand over the truffles.
They're booked.
Booked?
For the Scandia Hotel.
We've got "student cakes"
with the same ingredients.
I'll take them, then.
Okay.
Plus eight rum truffles.
Yes.
To eat at once?
Get your bloody act together.
I believe my hotel phoned?
... Yes.
If you'd sit here...
... Thanks.
I do the receptionist there.
Yes. He recommends you highly.
I'll take these off.
Just a trim?
Yes. Nothing too ?ashy.
You're not going dancing?
... No. I'm a pastor.
I'll cut you like a pastor,
then.
That'd be fine.
A nice moon
and a monk-like wreath of hair.
That'd be fine.
I wonder whether you could...
avoid pouring water
down my neck?
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
... Oh, damn.
Whoops, sorry. You're a pastor!
If we just dry you...
You're in early.
... Yes.
Finn... what do you think
of the work here?
Get your feet down!
That's a decent chair, right?
Eh? Finn? Do you like it?
I've had enough!
I have taken them down.
... I'm only...
This bloody hair of mine.
I can 1: Work.
Why not wear a hair net?
It's quite common
in the food industry.
It'd look bloody great
at the stadium restaurant, too.
<i>"Hello, Juventus! Welcome!</i>
<i>This is the stadium restaurant.
The manager wears a hair net. "</i>
You speak Italian?
What does it sound like,
eh, Prof?
Why not go to a hairdresser?
... Why not shut your face?
Well? What do you think
of the work?
I don't think of it as work.
I pretty much live here.
Do you <i>like</i> it or...
I built this place up
from scratch.
Have you tried our new sorbet?
No.
I've got to...
... Hey, Giulia...
<i>A Cup Final Special!</i>
<i>Just a moment!</i>
I've got to talk to you.
Is something up?
... Yes.
Is it serious?
... Yes.
Gone impotent, have you?
... Yes.
I haven't slept with a girl
for four years.
Four years?
Not since that Christmas,
the Friday before Christmas.
What about that chambermaid?
I couldn't do it.
She was even in uniform.
Well, an apron. No.
What about that goalie?
From the woman's handball team?
You were in her room...
No. I couldn't with her, either.
Do you know what you can do...
if you can do anything?
Get back on your horse...
Thanks for the advice, Finn.
<i>Here is your ice cream.</i>
Beautiful <i>.</i>
You just need
to find the <i>right girl.</i>
Do you mind repeating that?
Don't put your teaspoon
on the tablecloth, you pig!
Hello.
Do you have an appointment?
No, I just want the front off.
Okay.
Shall I just...
take an inch all around?
No, just in front.
A uniform trim looks nicer.
But you're not giving me one.
No.
Is this all right?
It's too hot, right?
... No.
You've got really thick hair.
Just a moment.
Mum...
... I'm sorry.
Come out back.
... I'm sorry.
You're so clever,
so nice and tidy.
If you sit down, I'll...
Shall I call a doctor?
I think you'd better call
an ambulance.
Yes.
The Kingdom of God does not come
in observable form.
We could not say, "Look, here
it is!" or "Look! There it is!"
The Kingdom of God is
in your midst or inside you.
The Gospels may be understood...
How primitive!
The Gospels may be understood
both ways.
N 0, no, no.
No!
God only exists as a concept.
We are guilty.
You are guilty.
The sisters point out
that you can cancel
for less than three.
Thank you.
Communion's off.
... What, canceled?
Yes, you could've had a lie- in.
... Never mind. We'll go training.
You could go
to the stadium with them
and get some exercise.
No, there's a swimming pool
at the hotel.
Don't you know anyone
hereabouts?
Oh, I won't be here that long.
Your wife was kind.
She was one of the only ones
who ever talked to me...
at the seminary.
They let me do
my last three months there
because I'd helped
in the prison chapel.
What... did you go to prison
for?
Junk.
Robbery.
I did three 7-11s,
a Blockbuster video store
two garages, two drug stores...
and the Royal Oak Hotel.
That's where they busted me.
Are you off of it now?
... Yes.
Now I have God.
Are you married?
No, but I go to Italian lessons.
Will you come next time?
There's plenty of room.
Strange you should ask.
The receptionist at the hotel...
asked me the same thing.
Jorgen Mortensen?
Yes, he is very helpful.
Dad?
... Serve them in here.
I'll fix you a sandwich.
... Just give me the rum truffles.
There weren't any more.
Yeah, you went
and dropped them.
You're fucking useless.
Hazelnut cream and marzipan.
Shall I make you a sandwich?
I don't know.
You've forgotten the salt beef.
You think I rot away here
for my own sake?
You go, then.
What?
If I hadn't stayed here
when your mother fucked off...
you'd still be sitting on the
floor in a soaking diaper.
You've got a bloody nerve!
Why don't you leave
like your mum?
She may have been
a great singer
but she was
a lousy human being.
Callous.
You take after her.
Dad?
... What time is it?
If it's all right,
I'd like a change now and then.
So would I.
Evening classes or something.
Don't be cheeky!
No... but I'd like to start
Italian.
You're too stupid to learn it.
Mum managed.
She was Italian. That's
different.
It's only once a week.
The council arranges it.
Is it mixed?
Yes... no,
I think it's mainly women.
That sounds fucking disgusting.
I'm going next time.
If you do,
we no longer know each other.
<i>- -I'd like a ticket to Italy.
- -I'd like a ticket to Italy.</i>
<i>- -Bravo, Halvfinn.
- -Thanks .</i>
Jorgen Mortensen. <i>. .</i>
<i>Would you like to ask
for a ticket to Italy, too?</i>
<i>I would like... a docket...</i>
<i>- -A ticket to Italy.
- -A ticket to Italy.</i>
<i>- -You have improved. Bravo.
- -Thank you.</i>
<i>Let's hear the ladies.
Read my lips.</i>
<i>I would like a ticket to Italy,
please.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>Please very much .</i>
Ah, we have <i>a</i> new student.
<i>Signorina, what's your name?</i>
<i>What:'s your name?</i>
Olympia.
<i>Good evening,
Signorina Olympia .</i>
<i>Good evening, Signorina
Olympia .</i>
<i>You'll get the hang of it.</i>
<i>Right, here we are in Italy.</i>
At the hotel. Repeat!
At the hotel.
<i>I would like a room. Lise?</i>
<i>I would like a room.</i>
<i>Beautiful, beautiful, like your
peaches-and-cream complexion.</i>
<i>Thank you.
"Peaches and cream," he said.</i>
<i>I would like a room with a View
of the city. Halvfinn?</i>
<i>A room with a View of the city.</i>
<i>The city... the people...</i>
<i>the sound of the fountains...
of the church bells...</i>
Kirsten... <i>Venice</i>.
<i>A room with a double bed.
Understand?</i>
<i>I understand .</i>
<i>I would like a room...</i>
<i>with a View of the city...</i>
<i>and a double bed.</i>
<i>A room with a double pizza.
No, sorry, a double patty.</i>
<i>Marcello, Marcello, what's up?</i>
<i>Marcello, what's happening?</i>
I'll call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!
... I'm a nurse.
Get out of the bloody way!
Marcello...
the ambulance has <i>come.</i>
Is it your first
Italian lesson, too?
No.
What are you lying there for?
Mum...
Help me.
... Come on.
Yes. That's better.
Will you light a cigarette for
me?
Yes. Wait a minute.
Come on, I'll wash your hair.
Sit down.
Let's see.
Did you bring me anything?
I came straight from the salon.
You're such a cow.
... Will you take this...
You promised
to bring me something.
I mustn't give you anything
while you're on medicine.
That's not your concern.
... No, but it's not allowed.
You should do what I tell you.
... Mum, let go. Let go!
There's nothing special about
a bloody ladies' hairdresser!
Groping the hair of strangers
for money.
Nobody rates you.
Relax, Mum.
Mum, we've got
to wash your hair.
You can have a smoke afterward.
It is in loneliness
that God seems farthest away.
And in grief...
... Jorgen Mortensen?
Just a minute.
I was just refilling
our Icelandic guest's minibar.
I haven't been updated
on the stadium restaurant.
About Halvfinn?
... Yes. When does he leave?
I gave him a warning,
a very serious warning
and he said he'd do something
about his hair.
He is to be dismissed
immediately. Good evening.
Can I help you
with your key cards?
But God is here...
in compassion, in friendship...
between us...
inside us...
in love... in every movement...
in the arm you slip
around the waist...
of your beloved.
Your Italian night, right?
... Yes, it's Wednesday.
You only go
to pick up the broads.
Sure I do, Birger.
Sugar, till, the other till...
cake, cake...
lights.
Hey, Ronlev!
<i>Ciao!</i>
Hello. I started last time.
Welcome to the class, Andreas.
This is Halvfinn.
I told you about him.
Andreas is staying
at the Scandia
until the Vicarage is vacant.
He's the temporary minister.
Hello. Can you all understand
what I'm saying?
Yes, we...
Right. My name is Ulrik.
You've no blackboard here?
I'm the one
in the side building.
I teach the stoneware class
and ceramic jewelry.
I expect you've heard about us.
Both classes
are oversubscribed.
Marcello Mercoledi
isn't coming back.
He didn't make it.
He was
an extremely good colleague
and a very nice teacher.
Will our class be canceled?
The council is looking for a
tutor
but it's difficult
and there are only seven of you.
Yes, for now!
The minimum is eight.
I'd love to have you
in my classes
but I am so much in demand.
And you don't teach Italian.
No, that's true.
I think you should
quietly pack your bags...
and go to your homes and see
which way the wind blows.
Finn?
Would your class like this?
Thank you. That's very kind.
I'm sorry.
You don't need any help, right?
Thank you.
It's a cinnamon wheel.
I had to cut it in half
to get it into the box.
Dad?
I may not be able
to do Italian after all.
The class is probably going
to be canceled
and I probably couldn't
learn it anyway...
though I'd really like to...
and maybe we wouldn't quarrel
so much if I got out a bit.
I went this evening, actually.
I know you don't like...
I'm sorry, Dad, but...
I think it's actually
a very good course.
Someone even took a cake.
Me, actually.
Closed?
No. Come on in.
I owe you a cut.
Come on, then.
I'll take a little to start
with.
You can say if you want more.
Fair enough.
The hairdresser's.
Yes.
Good-bye.
I'm sorry, but I've got to go.
<i>So if you...</i>
would go, too...
No.
You must.
That's lousy style.
I'm sorry.
Thanks. I'll manage.
We've got your mother
into a single room... Number 73.
Was she disturbing the others?
It's for her own sake.
Why restrict her morphine now?
We're not restricting it.
We're keeping her
out of pain now.
Thank you.
Is it empty?
No.
Is that morphine?
They haven't
turned it up enough.
I've got something to tell you.
What's that?
Turn it up first.
It's not allowed.
That's up to me.
No.
Why are you dolled up like that?
I don't know.
You look like a hooker.
Yes.
Turn it up.
It's not allowed.
In that case, I won't tell you.
Hey, you! Move, pal.
We were wondering how long
you'd been on the course.
Two Football Specials!
No!
Juventus came to play.
I talked to them, okay?
And that got you going?
Two Football Specials!
Shut your face!
We're out of pumpernickel.
I can't send Giulia out for more
with So people waiting, can I?
You couldn't take over
the teaching, could you?
That sounds stupid.
You are the best of us.
Or the council will close us.
Don't you work for the council?
Not that department.
You could try.
There'd only be seven students.
They'd close us.
How about a Rounders Special?
Aren't they with white bread?
Are you under 12?
... No.
Do I look as if I'd serve
raisins to a full-grown man?
You have to be under 12
for a Rounders Special.
Firstly,
I'm not going to look stupid.
Secondly, I have
a good job already.
Can I have a chocolate milk?
... Shut up!
This is a restaurant,
not a children's home.
We sit down and we eat
with knives and forks. Get it?
We don't put our feet on the table
and if you don't like it, out!
Finn?
... It's certainly not your turn.
Excuse me, have you a moment?
Excuse me, want a bloody nose?
Finn, you're fired.
What do you mean?
I mean you've got 15 minutes
to beat it.
<i>Who is this idiot?</i>
The boss of the hotel
that runs this <i>place.</i>
<i>Tell him we know
the receptionist</i>
<i>and he'll beat him up.</i>
<i>He couldn't care.</i>
<i>He's the receptionist's boss,
too.</i>
<i>Then punch his nose yourself.</i>
What is she saying?
<i>Come into the kitchen
and I'll castrate you.</i>
She asks if that's your Cortina.
No, mine's a GTI.
<i>You can get out your dick.</i>
<i>I'll find a sharp knife
and fillet it for you.</i>
She asks if you want
to go to the kitchen
and taste a delicacy.
<i>"Macho obrigado, Signori ta!</i>"
<i>Tell him that if you go, I go.</i>
<i>That'd be stupid.</i>
<i>It's a stupid job.</i>
<i>Why should I stay
if you're not here?</i>
<i>And if you're not here...</i>
<i>Jorgen Mortensen
won't come any more.</i>
<i>If he goes, I go...</i>
Will you translate?
No.
Will you?
<i>Um...</i>
<i>She says...</i>
if he goes, she goes.
Fine. That's a deal. Good-bye.
You don't have to do that.
You don't work here any more.
If this hadn't happened, you'd
have been here till you were 75.
That would have made me 77.
You should get married, Jorgen.
What will Giulia do?
Figure out what to do
with her life.
How about you?
I don't know.
Have you ever been to Italy?
No.
I was going to go to Venice
but we canceled
the last moment.
Have you been to Italy?
No... but my mum is Italian.
That's why I'm coming here.
Oh? That's good.
You seem to be right-
it's been canceled.
It's really a very,
very good course.
Oh? Is it?
... Yes.
Can I give you a lift?
No, thanks. I've got my bike.
You've done the buttons up
wrong.
Is that your car?
Yes.
Isn't it Italian?
Yes, it's a Maserati.
It's really lovely.
Doesn't your wife just love it?
My wife died in May.
My dad's just died, too.
He hadn't said a word about it.
Nor had my wife.
Was she ill?
She had schizophrenia.
We just didn't realize
that it was so serious.
She was a very strong believer.
We assumed...
In God?
Yes. Far stronger than I.
I must be getting on home.
Of course. Sorry.
Thanks.
Is it your first time?
Yes.
Don't be nervous.
You'll cope.
Very nice.
Hello.
My condolences.
I'm sorry...
My father's the one
who's having his funeral.
I had no idea it was you.
I haven't talked
to any of the other relatives.
Sit down and the pastor
will come in a moment.
The organist is in hospital.
Never mind.
Is he really the pastor here?
Yes.
Andreas is standing in
for Pastor Wredmann.
Count yourself lucky.
<i>Ask if it's really
hymn number 367.</i>
<i>Right.</i>
We'll begin
with hymn number 367
"This Blessed Day."
Excuse me.
We're in doubt
about the hymn on the board.
And where are the ?owers?
My husband says
the coffin should have been
mahogany, too.
Was your cousin's name
Mercoledi?
<i>No, my uncle .</i>
Is your father also called
Marcello Mercoledi?
No, he is called Leif.
Then perhaps your father
isn't dead at all?
Yes, he's the one
who's going to be buried.
Your uncle is in the chapel.
His funeral is at 3:00 PM.
I'm sorry, Padre.
That's all right.
Never mind.
I expect it happens all the time.
My apologias.
The new pastor
cocked things up.
He is only temporary.
<i>Good-bye .</i>
Allow me.
... Thank you.
Have you anyone
to talk to tonight?
Oh, I'm used to being alone.
Shouldn't you go back to the
church for that other funeral?
Yes, indeed.
Thank you.
Marcello Mercoledi,
wasn't he your Italian teacher?
Yes.
Do you know if they've found
a replacement?
No.
What's the matter
with your organist?
There was some disagreement
about the accentuation
of a hymn.
Pastor Wredmann
got rather physical.
He pushed the organist
over the balcony.
I believe he damaged his spleen
<i>or...</i>
Take care.
Thanks.
Hi.
... Hi.
Shall I just sit down?
Yes.
If you'll...
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my mum.
She just died.
... Okay... okay...
She was very ill.
So... she would have died
anyway.
What did she die of?
Morphine.
You don't have to go.
I can still cut your hair.
Kirsten... Kisser?
... Yes?
Have you any news of Finn?
Halvfinn?
... Yes.
It's just that he's left
the stadium restaurant now.
So has the Italian kitchen maid.
So I was wondering... No?
Hello. Can you all understand
what I'm saying?
My name is Ulrik.
We've searched high and low
for a new teacher for you.
It hasn't been easy
but we have succeeded.
We've recruited one internally.
I'm sure you'll be pleased
with our compromise.
Finn!
<i>Hi.</i>
Over to you, Finn.
How marvelous that you agreed,
Finn!
Why don't you shut your gob?
Always yakking <i>away...</i>
<i>Right. We were booking
a double room in Venice.</i>
<i>With a bath, yes.</i>
<i>Right;</i>
Anything else?
May I get that?
No, I want two rum Danish.
Yes, okay.
That'll be 21.50.
Thank you.
Just a moment.
The bakery.
Yes?
Yes, speaking.
What?
Now my mum has died.
Shouldn't you go home?
I'll shut the shop.
I'll get the sack.
Drink this.
She was here and I didn't know.
Shall I serve them?
Oh, would you?
Just for ten minutes?
Mind you, don't drop anything!
Our organist is still in
hospital...
the same ward as the deceased,
I believe.
Are you sure you've come
to the right place?
I think they've
mixed things up again.
They got the times wrong
last time, too.
This is a funeral.
Yes, I've arranged it.
Oh?
Did you know my mother?
Hello, Karen.
... Hello.
Whose funeral is this?
Karen's mother's.
I thought it was my mother's.
I'm sorry.
I must have made a mistake.
Karen, the nurse
on your mother's ward...
says that your mother told her
she had two daughters.
We'll start by singing
hymn number 367
"This Blessed Day."
So, you lived with Dad?
Yes.
I seemed to recall a little sister
from when I was very young,
but Mum said I was wrong.
Did you live in Italy?
Why would I do that?
She was very talented, so she
had to go home to Italy...
to sing.
"Home to Italy"?
Wasn't she an opera singer?
She never quite made it.
Nor was she Italian.
Was that something
your father told you?
I don't know.
Yes.
Was he there today, my father?
No.
He wouldn't even come
to her funeral?
He almost only just died.
What's your name?
Olympia.
I was nine
before <i>I</i> could pronounce it.
My real name is Carmen.
That's hideous, too.
Have you got a pen?
<i>Excuse me, Signorina.</i>
<i>May I borrow a pen and paper?</i>
Here <i>.</i>
<i>Thank you .</i>
She does Italian.
So does Andreas.
It's not very neat.
No.
Shall I put my address, too?
No, that'll do fine.
Are you two an item?
N 0.
... N 0.
Got anyone to talk to tonight?
Oh, I'm used to being alone.
<i>Many thanks .</i>
Go carefully.
... Thanks.
Thanks for your help.
... Take care, now.
Do you think she'll phone?
If she can read your writing.
<i>Dear Virgin Mary...</i>
<i>open Jorgen Mortensen 's eyes
and make him</i> find <i>me.</i>
Hi, Karen.
Can you cut my hair?
Yes, come on in.
... Thanks.
The usual?
... Yes, above the collar.
May I keep this on?
A bit of a sore throat?
I'm not quite myself these days.
Where do you want me?
In the middle,
and it's on the house.
You've sent me a few customers.
Oh, yes, from the hotel.
Yes, and the guy
from the stadium restaurant.
Halvfinn, yes.
... Halvfinn.
Has it closed down?
No. He left, that's all.
I don't go there any more myself.
Giulia isn't there any more,
either... the Italian girl.
I don't know where she's gone.
Is she his girlfriend?
Oh, no. They're not match at
all.
No, she worked in the kitchen.
Oh, her?
I've only just seen her.
Here?
No, at the Italian restaurant.
I think she works there.
I won't need this after all.
Good. Now I can see...
Has Halvfinn got a new job?
Yes, our Italians.
Football?
No, a language class...
run by the council...
once a week.
Oh? Is there a girl
in the class called Olympia?
Olymp... Yes, there is.
Olympia.
Excuse me, Halvfinn?
Is it all right
for me to bring my elder sister
and she can see
if Italian is anything for her?
Couldn't you have
mentioned it before?
Just how many strawberries
are you short of <i>a picnic?</i>
Hi.
... Hi.
<i>Your mum is also Italian, then?</i>
Thank you.
I brought these.
Eight rum truffles <i>.</i>
<i>Thanks .</i>
Andreas, the door, please.
<i>Yes...</i>
<i>- -Right, are we all here?
- -Yes.</i>
No.
... Where is Jorgen Mortensen?
We don't know
where Jorgen Mortensen is.
"You don't know
where Jorgen Mortensen is."
"We don't know
where Jorgen Mortensen is."
"We don '1: know where
Jorgen Mortensen is."
<i>- -Excuse me?
- -Signor Mortensen?</i>
<i>May I have a Jolly Cola?</i>
<i>Certainly. I'll bring it.</i>
<i>I... am sitting just over</i>
there.
<i>- -Thank you.
- -You're welcome.</i>
<i>It's lovely to review you
again.</i>
<i>Would you like to go
to school with me?</i>
<i>- -To school?
- -Yes .</i>
<i>I go to school.</i>
<i>I'm learning Italian.</i>
But there's one tiny problem.
<i>A tiny problem?</i>
<i>I already speak Italian.</i>
<i>Get a move on.</i>
<i>Sorry</i>
<i>Just the bill, please.</i>
<i>Holy Virgin Mary,
Why' am I so ugly and stupid?</i>
<i>- -Penalty.
- -Penalty.</i>
<i>- -Throw-in.
- -Throw-in .</i>
<i>- -Goalie.
- -Goalie.</i>
<i>- -To whistle.
- -To whistle .</i>
You 're getting better
and better.
<i>That 's all .</i>
<i>- -Good-bye.
- -Good-bye .</i>
<i>Good night .</i>
Isn't he just brilliant?
He's got the knack.
Good night, Karen.
... Good night.
At first, I didn't understand a
word, but it comes just like that.
Are you getting the bus, too?
... I want a word with the teacher.
You think you'll
keep on coming?
Yes.
Do you look like our mum did?
A little, perhaps.
See you.
You should watch that step.
It gets a bit dirty.
But your desk is clean.
This place is bloody filthy.
Some drama class is doing
some fuddy-duddy musical.
Did you know I was the teacher?
Yes.
Are you okay?
Yes.
When somebody dies, how long is
it before you can fall in love?
At once, I reckon.
Even if it's your wife
who's dead?
Is it the pastor?
What do you want for Christmas?
This salon.
Then I'd be the boss.
No... I'd be happy with a scarf.
What do you want?
A husband and a house
and not to go out to work...
or those long earrings
we saw at the shopping center.
How will you spend Christmas?
I don't know.
What did you use to do?
We stayed at home.
Never had a boyfriend?
Not for Christmas.
- -Hello <i>.</i>
- -Hello.
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Can you cut my hair?</i>
<i>I am not the hairdresser.</i>
<i>My sister is .</i>
<i>I see. Is it possible?</i>
Shall I just take the ends?
<i>No, I want much more off.
Shorten it right up to here.</i>
Short?
<i>Yes .</i>
That'd be a shame.
... I want to look <i>like a</i> lady.
<i>- -A lady?
- -Yes, of 33 or 35.</i>
She wants to look
like a 35 year old.
The bartender fixed a Travista
instead of a pint of lager.
Maybe you'd like it?
Thanks.
Have you been a pastor
for long?
I qualified this summer.
Do people come and tell you
all kinds of weird things?
Yes, we provide counsel
for the soul.
It's just that... It's just
that I've got problems.
At the hotel?
No, it's more of a...
I don't know how
the church puts it, but...
women.
Do they have any effect on you?
Sure they do.
It may be due
to an old athletics injury.
It's that muscle... underneath.
I used to play football.
We were a goal down against
Brondby and you take chances.
I ran into a hard tackle
and I heard a crack...
And you went impotent?
<i>Yes...</i>
<i>but...</i>
not when I'm alone; only when...
I'm with a girl.
So I haven't been...
for quite a while.
That's quite okay.
Nor have I, for six months.
In my case, it's...
four years.
Do you Pray?
Yes, or I couldn't be a pastor.
N 0, quite.
It would probably be a bit weird
to pray to God
about my problem...
No. It's a matter
for the individual.
I could start by praying
a girl would come along
who I wasn't scared of.
You could, yes.
She might also come by herself.
That'd probably be better.
One can tell you're a pastor.
Can one?
It's not going very well,
though.
<i>No...</i>
but it will.
I'll do another length.
Every grieving soul,
Be filled with joy
Shake off your burden of pain
A child is born
in the town of David
To comfort every heart
We will find the child
in ourselves
And become children
in soul and mind
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Child Jesus!
Merry Christmas.
... Merry Christmas.
Good you're back, Christian.
... Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
You should apply for the post.
Thank you.
Going to wish him
a Merry Christmas?
We didn't get a rocket this
year.
No, no rocket this year.
I'll pop over
to my mother's grave. See you!
Do apply for the job.
... Thank you.
Excuse me. Hi.
Is the food no good?
Oh, it's fine.
I wonder if I might sit here?
Is there a draft in there?
No. Not at all.
Shall I fetch your pudding?
No, never mind.
You won't escape the present
that goes with it, though.
These are what we give.
Oh, there's no need.
You'll make it, Andreas.
The worst things are
the first Christmas
and the first birthday.
I remember what it was like
after my mother died.
But Christmas doesn't last long.
No.
I was just...
... That's all right.
Merry Christmas.
Those are our pudding prizes.
<i>Holy Virgin...</i>
on this night
when you bore your son. <i>. .</i>
The Lord revealed himself in the
tiniest, poorest of people.
Waitress!
<i>Make</i> Jorgen Mortensen
feel the quintessence of love...
<i>and come over
for a glass of Marsala.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Ciao! Come on in!</i>
<i>Good evening, Pas tor .</i>
<i>May I offer you something?</i>
<i>A drink?</i>
What is she saying?
Do we want a drink?
And we do, right?
There she is.
<i>- -Here you are.
- -Thank you.</i>
<i>- -Marsala.
- -Thank you. Marsala.</i>
<i>Merry Christmas, Giulia!</i>
<i>Merry Christmas to you.</i>
Cheers <i>!</i>
<i>What the hell has happened
to your hair?</i>
<i>You look like a 74 year old.</i>
<i>It's because I'm in love
with a man of 96.</i>
I like your hairdo.
<i>Thank you .</i>
It's classical.
<i>Thank you, Holy Mother.
He likes my hair.</i>
I'd like to pay.
<i>Right away .</i>
She's cute, isn't she?
She is.
But it's no good.
She's Italian, you know.
You won't get to sleep with her
until you're married
and that kind of puts a spanner
in your works
and all the food she cooks,
she also eats, and in six months
she'll put on 500 pounds
and look like her mother.
Not all daughters end up looking
like their mums.
I certainly hope not.
That Karen... the hairdresser-
her mum...
Did you ever see her?
She could drink, man.
She drank like a fish.
Her hair was all bedraggled.
It was gross, and she was even
a hairdresser's mum.
She drank like...
... What's this thing about hair?
<i>Hi.</i>
Are you bad-mouthing
my mother?
How dare you?
You never even knew her.
And what about you?
You're useless.
You can't hold down a job.
Don't you dare say things
like that about my mother.
You haven't even got
any parents.
Nobody wanted you, did they?
I hope I never see you again.
That's fine by me.
And if my sister hears
what you said, I'll kill you.
I'll bet.
Good-bye.
Lise?
... Hello. Merry Christmas.
Actually, I was
on my way to see you.
How is your sister doing?
Have you noticed
how clumsy she is?
Yes, I know her
from our Italian class.
She must have got it
from our father.
Or your mother-
prenatal alcohol damage.
Alcohol damage?
It's not unusual.
That's my bus.
I turned up the morphine.
That's not allowed.
Your mother died
of an infected pancreas.
Yes, but...
... Yes.
I must be going.
How about a cocktail?
I'm not on again till 4:00.
Go home, will you?
Wasn't she beautiful? Giulia?
With her new hairdo?
A shame we didn't get
to have a little chat with her.
You don't speak Italian, Jorgen.
Don't say that, Finn.
It's the feeling that counts.
You can't get it up, man.
Can you?
She seemed...
... Go inside, man.
She seemed a bit upset... Karen.
Go inside, will you?
I don't think she meant you
to get upset, too.
Cut it out, man!
Who are you?
Merry Christmas!
You've no conception
of Christmas.
Are you entertaining?
How dare you? You smell
of alcohol. What do you want?
To ask if I should apply
for your job.
What for?
For the church,
the congregation.
The congregation?
May I come in?
How could you shepherd
an entire congregation?
You can't decide whether
to stay outside or come in.
Running off
and leaving your wife!
May I come in?
Yes, come in, then.
... Thank you.
God exists.
If we believe in Him, He is there.
My wife is not at home. No.
My wife is dead.
She's been dead four years.
God took her away from me
and she took God away from me.
God is an abstraction
and you'll never get
those retards to see that.
What use is discussing things
at such an abstract level?
What's the use?
You don't know the meaning
of loss.
To see a human being...
to see the person you love
disappearing...
to see the simplest things
become impossible...
By the end, she couldn't even
strike a match.
She just disappeared.
That doesn't give you the right
to run that church
into the ground.
Your grief is no different
from anyone ease's here.
Elisabeth wasn't like
the other meaningless people...
we have to keep burying.
Then keep your distance
and let us air out that church!
Why should you care
what people believe?
Leave them alone!
You've no idea
what you're talking about;
You don't know pain or loss,
or love!
I know what I'm talking about.
You are so deeply,
deeply selfish, Wredmann!
Get on with your life!
Did you notice Giulia
at the Italian restaurant?
Yes, I did.
She is beautiful.
Yes, very beautiful.
She's a Roman Catholic.
I believe they don't...
sleep with anyone
till after they're married.
Yes, I believe
that's quite common.
I certainly saw her smiling
at you.
Oh?
Maybe I should ask her...
if she'd like to go for a walk.
That sounds like a good idea.
<i>Would you like to...</i>
<i>promenade with me?</i>
Excuse me, may I take
your blood pressure? Lise?
<i>Excuse me, may I take
my blood pressure?</i>
A liter of milk, please?
<i>A liter of milk, please.</i>
Where is your sister?
My sister is in the
refrigerator.
<i>Thank you.
Good-bye .</i>
<i>Thank you . Good-bye .</i>
Have you got five minutes?
I just don't know what to do
about that Karen.
I think you should say sorry.
Sorry?
She was the one who...
In that case,
begin by forgiving her.
<i>If you like a girl...
what do you do?</i>
<i>I don't like any girls.</i>
<i>Would you try
to get your leg over her?</i>
<i>Like hell I would.</i>
<i>The only thing he's asked me is
to learn to speak Italian.</i>
Jorgen Mortensen.
Jorgen Mortensen?
<i>Yes .</i>
<i>The same Jorgen Mortensen?</i>
<i>He s handsome .</i>
<i>You'll have to sort it out
by yourself.</i>
Where are you 901'-"9?
<i>See you, Giulia.</i>
<i>Hey, what am I going to do?</i>
120.
... Yes.
Good-bye. Have a lovely party.
... And a lovely vacation.
What are you doing here?
I've been thinking about you.
Yes. Just stay away.
I've come to say sorry.
You should've thought of that.
Sorry.
Shall I pick you up after work?
No.
I have said sorry.
Yes. Good-bye.
Karen...
Good-bye.
Hello, Olympia.
Are you busy?
No. I was just reading...
about loss.
I lost my grip and dropped
two trays of pastries just now.
Can't you just pick them up
again?
A dozen eggs fell on top.
I drop everything.
I can't keep anything straight.
I can hardly write.
I go round with bruises here
and on my elbows.
I hadn't the energy
to clean up the mess.
So you just left the shop?
I did lock the door...
but I don't want to go back.
I've had 43 jobs
since I left school.
Three months
and they realize how bad I am.
I've only lasted so long
at the baker's...
because I put money in the till
for all that I drop...
so the baker doesn't find out.
I am useless.
No, it's not too good.
No.
I don't know if I can help
you...
but I can start
by giving you a tissue.
Is that any good?
And a little cup of coffee?
I'm afraid I can't offer you
a pastry.
Somebody dropped eggs on them.
<i>Hello.</i>
There was a letter
from the bank.
Can you sit in the noise maker?
I can lend you the money.
No, it's not that.
I didn't think my father had
any money at all
but there's 635,000 crowns.
Where from?
He hardly ever bought anything.
So now it's yours.
No, ours! Look!
Now you can buy the salon
if you want to...
and the bank is open late today.
No... he was your father.
When mum died, you didn't
inherit anything, did you?
I inherited you.
Yeah.
We could go to Italy.
If anybody goes to Italy...
I think you should ask the rest
of the class if they want to go.
And the teacher.
If it's just the one Sunday,
I think I can find a stand-in.
What about you, Beate?
Can I go?
That would be really nice.
Lise?
I can swap my shifts, so...
How about you, Karen?
Well, yes.
<i>And you, Halvfinn?
Do you want to go?</i>
Of course.
What about you, Jorgen?
Yes.
- -Eight <i>.</i>
<i>Yes .</i>
<i>Right, let's commence.</i>
Yes?
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>I want to enroll.</i>
<i>You what?!</i>
<i>I want to enroll
in this Italian class.</i>
Then they won't close us down!
She's got an ear for languages!
It's the girl from the
restaurant.
Giulia?
<i>And if you have any objections</i>
<i>I won't answer
for the consequences.</i>
<i>Very well. Welcome, then.</i>
<i>We're all going away.</i>
<i>Fine. I'll come, too.</i>
Nine?
Nine.
<i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>Would you like...</i>
<i>to promenade with me?</i>
Very <i>much .</i>
<i>Where shall we go?</i>
<i>"Where shall we go?"</i>
I don't know, Jorgen.
Where shall we go?
I was thinking... perhaps...
Venice?
Were you seasick?
... N 0.
Are you thinking
about your wife?
No.
Oh, yes.
<i>- -My name is Jorgen Mortensen.
- -I'm honored.</i>
Mind you don't fall
into the canal, eh, Olympia?
Take this off first... there.
We're <i>ridiculous, standing</i>
here.
<i>Jorgen is a great photographer.</i>
Keep it perfectly still.
<i>Silent, yes? Thank you.</i>
<i>- -Electronic fuel injection.
- -Yes.</i>
<i>- -ABS brakes.
- -ABS brakes.</i>
<i>- -Jorgen Mortensen.
- -Yes .</i>
<i>- - "Card of paste..."
- -Postcard.</i>
For my mother.
... For your mother.
How do you say "stamp"?
- -Stamp <i>.</i>
- -Stamp <i>.</i>
I'll go and buy one.
See you.
... Si. <i>. .</i> Yes.
<i>Let's go!</i>
Go on up.
I'll just be a moment.
<i>Oh...</i> okay.
Look.
What do you think?
Come with me.
Giulia, I know you can't
understand what I'm saying...
but I'll say it anyway.
I'm ten years older than you
and I'm not really good
at anything.
I've no relatives any more.
I'm no good at my job.
I've no hobbies...
apart from doing Italian...
and that's really
for Halvfinn's sake...
because I'm no real good
at languages.
I can't even say anything to
you.
Actually, I think I'm rather
dull.
I certainly haven't
your temperament...
and sex isn't something
I feel confident about any more.
I know you don't understand
what I'm saying...
but if I don't say it now,
I'll never get it said.
But I love you, Giulia, and I
want to be with you for always.
I'd like to have children...
and to watch you get older...
and grow old.
I'll love you every day
from when I wake up
till we go to bed at night.
I so much want to marry you,
Giulia.
I do understand a bit of Danish.
<i>I just speak it very badly.</i>
Perhaps I would like
to marry you...
but I want to go to a church...
<i>Yes .</i>
And think it over.
<i>Yes .</i>
<i>- -Will you wait for me?
- -Yes.</i>
<i>- -Wait for me here.
- -Yes.</i>
<i>Yes .</i>
<i>Yes?</i>
<i>Yes .</i>
Olympia?
Would you like to swap?
It's much easier
to get mine onto the fork.
If you like...
Well, Jorgen Mortensen?
All right?
Actually...
I think my athletics injury
is getting better.
It must be the climate.
I expect so.
What a lovely voice!
Thanks.
I certainly sing a lot <i>.</i>
The two choristers
at the church
they're beginning to stress out
because the church is
so full now.
We could use a soprano.
So, I was thinking...
Only if you want to, though.
We'll have to keep the rear seats
free in case you fall off...
but you won't.
How about it?
... Yes, please.
That's wonderful.
This is it.
You go in first.
... Okay.
Hi!
... Here's Karen.
Sorry I'm late.
... Thanks.
- -Hi <i>.</i>
- -Good evening.
Hi.
... Hi.
<i>Look what he gave me.</i>
<i>- -Who?
- -Jorgen Mortensen .</i>
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>
<i>No, ugly...</i>
<i>Like your hair .</i>
No, I didn't cut him.
This dinner's on me.
No need for that, Andreas.
Yes, because I'm going
to sell the Maserati.
Oh, no!
... Why?
I won't be needing it much
any more.
