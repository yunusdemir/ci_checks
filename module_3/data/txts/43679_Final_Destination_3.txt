Aw, sick!
Worth the wait.
Oh, babe.
You missed out.
GIRL: Yes!
(BOY CRYING)
I want to get off.
Whoo! Ow!
Ha ha ha!
KEVIN: That was
intense, man.
To feel how that
would be
to just crash and
burn like that.
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe for you,
but our lives are
actually goin' somewhere.
Oh! Ok, well,
where we gotta go
is to
the roller coaster.
'Cause our pass
is for 9:15.
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line
for, like, a day and a half
and that's gonna kill me.
Ok!
All right?
So let's go.
They're totally
gonna dig this, man!
Ok. Come on,
it won't kill us
to get a deep-fried
snickers and a coke.
Before ridin'
devil's flight?
Yeah,
that might kill me.
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.
Ha ha ha!
(RIDERS SCREAMING)
(SCREECHING ON TRACKS AND SCREAMING)
Unh!
Ha ha!
KEVIN: Oh,
I'll take that.
WENDY: No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.
It's the yearbook's.
Just--Kevin.
Ha ha!
JASON: Oh!
KEVIN: Oh, got it.
Oh, my God,
you're such an idiot.
Hey. Hey.
Gimme the--
CARRIE: Ha ha!
Ow!
Nice.
Um, could you, like, please
delete that one of Stacy?
Ha ha!
These are

WENDY: And I have to
turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline
and, like, I doubt it
if a shot of Stacy
Kobayashi's camel toe
is gonna make it
in there.
Whew. I'd buy 2.
Ha ha ha!
(MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER)
Number 38, your order's ready.
That's us.
I am so sorry.
Kevin can get
so out of control.
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak,
like I couldn't
handle that.
I'm breaking up
with him.
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.
I've been wanting
to for a while.
But don't tell
anybody, ok?
KEVIN: Whoa. Ha ha!
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.
I love it.
I love it.
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

Let's go on again!
What's wrong?
I'm--
I was having that feeling
like dejá vu, you know?
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.
Hey, J.
Come on, man,
let's go.
Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Come on.
What, are you
weirded out by the ride?
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe
you're nervous about
this roller coaster
because they say the real
fear with these rides
comes from the feeling
of having no control.
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.
Never.
Ok.
DEVIL: You can run,
but you cannot hide.
Oh! Where you guys
are right now,
if you raise
your hands and just...
Ha! Cup them

It'll look you're holding

do that why?

see a dick that big?
I'm lookin' at one
right now.
Ha ha! Man,
you guys are smokin' hot.
Get out,
Frankie.
Yeah, why are you
even here?
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.
I stuck around to monitor
your development.
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.
DEVIL: You may never return
from devil's flight.
Ha ha ha ha!
You're totally sad.

That was

Yeah! Sweet!
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING AND LAUGHING)
You all right?
There's nothing
to worry about.
A roller coaster is
just elemental physics.
A conversion of potential
energy to kinetic energy.
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million
of dying in
a roller coaster.
Yeah, yeah, thanks
for that, McKinley.
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park
than dying at one.

Hey, Wendy!
Hey!
Wait! Wendy!
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.
I need--I need to talk
to you about something.
Just here to
pick up my diploma.
You're not going
to graduation?
No.
Look, you're not
the only one
in a fucked up
place, ok?
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe
it'd be good for you
to be somewhere
where other people
feel the same way.
At graduation?
No. Thanks. I've had
enough funerals.
Then do it
for J and Carrie.
Do what? If you die,
then there's nothing,
then you're just dead,
and they don't know.
And if they are up in heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi,
do you think
they really care about
our high school
graduation? No.
I am alive
and I don't care.
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot,
I am so out of McKinley.
Without J,
what's here for me?
I'm here. Ok?
I made a promise to J
that I would
take care of you.
On the ride.
For 3 minutes.
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.
(SIGHS) Kevin...
If it wasn't for
you and J being friends
and me and Carrie
being friends,
we wouldn't have
even hung out.
We don't even
like each other.
"Ian McKinley."
(SIGHS) How pathetic
is it that my last name
is the same
as my high school?
Julie, look who I got
to sign my yearbook.
No way. Nice.
Yeah.
I think we should
invite her.
You think?
Yeah.
Wen? Um...
So we're ready for
graduation tonight,
we're going to the tanning
salon after this,
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.
ASHLYN: Totally.
And just like,
talk if you want.
Here's my cell.
I already have
your number.
That was
so nice of us.
(THUNDER)
You're not alone.
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.
Ok? I really do.
No, it's
happened before.
Ok? I went online looking
for an explanation about--
Wendy, just--just
listen to me, all right?
All right, look,
I went online
looking for
an explanation
about what happened,
and I found out
about this high
school French class
from New York.
6 years ago they went
on a trip to Paris.
When they were boarding,
a kid had a vision
that the plane
was gonna explode.
Just like you did.
He freaked out
and 7 people
got off the plane.
Just like us.
And on takeoff,
flight 180 blew up.
And over the next
several months,
everyone who got off
that plane
started dying
in weird accidents.
They died in the order
they would've
if they had stayed
on the plane.
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.
Fuck you, Kevin.
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!
(THUNDER)
(YURI YELLING IN RUSSIAN)

Ohh, every time
we come here.
I was thinking
of going
for 20 minutes
in the muller.
We did that for
all the funerals
and it turned out
amazing.
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.
I mean, we're still
pretty bronzed.
I was just thinking we could
go for, like, a tune-up.
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.
Yeah.
You know, for all those kids
that died that night
who will never get
a graduation.
(SIGHS)
You know what?
You're totally right.

Julie?

I could use
some help.
I have such...
Such guilt over Jason.
I should never have
let that ride go.
God. I'm usually such
a control freak,
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.
I should've done
everything I could
to stop it.
And I would
give anything
to have
a second chance.
But I never can.
I don't want
to some day
feel that way
about you, Julie.
I mean, I can't talk
to mom and dad.
You're all
I have left.
You think when
I find a place
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?
You know I will.
You...
Keep this now
and I'll get it
when I come see you.
Oh. And...Hey,
how 'bout on your end?
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?
Yeah. As long as you bring it
back to school on Monday.
Done.
Oh. Um--
actually, the battery
is pretty low,
so why don't you go get ready
and I'll recharge it a bit.
Cool.

We may feel that
our lives are not our own.
That death controls,
frames our lives.
Our birth's nothing
but death begun.
Yet, whether it is
with this tragic loss
of young lives
which we have
suffered much of late...
Or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night.
We are all equal
in death's eyes.
"Equal in death's eyes?"

If I'd've seen their--
whatever--humanity--
They wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorize.
Stretch. Tan.
Don't be down, Frankie.
Be proud of your ability
to make everything
that happens somehow
a story about you.
God!
Yo, man. These things
really suck, man.
Fucking boring.
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral,
man, bring me
a PSP or somethin'.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)
(SIGHS)
(RING)
Hello?
WENDY: I'm with J.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
What are you doing up
here in the nosebleeds?
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.
And I wondered if maybe
here I could feel J's...
Spirit or presence or...
Whatever.
(SIGHS)
But now that I'm here,
if there's any place
that makes me feel
like there's
no life after death...
It's a cemetery.
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.
And I've tried.
Real hard. Heh.
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...
That night...Before
I got on the ride,
Jason said--
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride--
he said...
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination,
but this fear is more
than just being scared.
It's like a presence.
Like a living thing
always with me.
You think it's J?
No, I know it's not.
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.
It's cold
and terrifying.
(TREES CREAKING)
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.
The photographic plate
was broken,
causing a line
that can't be removed.
Exactly where
he was shot.
WENDY: Look.
See the shadow?
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?
Look. This occurred
one year to the day
of the flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.
Look, I guess you came
to me with this
because I'm responsible for
putting this in your head,
with the
flight 180 thing.
And it did happen, and
it may be occurring here
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there
because you're desperate
for an answer.
I took these.
That night.
These?
Are these it?
Oh, shit.
Oh...Shit.
(SIGHS)
Whoa, whoa, hey.
You all right?
I'm feeling
a little woozy.
When was
the last time you ate?
I don't remember.
KEVIN: All right,
come on. I'll drive.
(AIRPLANE ENGINES WHINE)
Ok, those kids on
flight 180 died in accidents
in the order
they would've died
if they'd have
stayed on the plane.
Ok? So if this
is that, then...
Then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture,
I felt this instinct.
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even--
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.
Well, what's Frankie's
picture look like?
It's right here.
You got it?
Yeah.
Wait! Watch out!
Oh!
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?
Sorry!
(SIGHS)
WENDY: All right,
let's just eat over there.
And go through
the drive through.
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.
Well, it's nice to see that
things haven't made you
any less of a control freak.
You got it?
Yeah, all right.
Here's Frank's
picture.
All right.
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.
Look, or maybe
it's not that literal.
All right, what's--
could there be anything
in these prizes?
Oh, what, like
he's gonna get crushed
by a giant sponge Bob?
Hey, Sponge Bob
lives underwater.
It's so sad that
you know that.
All right. He won that
tacky mud-flap girl chain
on this game, though, so...
Aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?
Yeah. Yeah.
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.
(HONKING)
All right! God.
All right.
MAN:
Uh, can I take your order?
Yeah. What
do you want?

You need a ride?
Um, we can walk
to my house
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.
No, thanks,
we'll be ok.
Will we?
(SIGHS)
Yeah.
We'll be all right.
I mean...
How Frank--
God, it--it's
not only horrible,
but can you feel...
Can you feel
how vicious it was?
Easy.
Ok? Easy.
Let's just...
Let's just take
a step back.
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.
Nothing in that picture
pointed to this.
We were wrong
about the photos.
(SIGHS)
I should've left town.
It's better
not knowing.
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.
Willful ignorance is
surrendering control.
What, did you read
that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks'
English class?
No. I--
you know, I'm not--
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.
WENDY: Ok, that's
Lewis after Frank,
then Ian and Erin.
There's a couple of
kids behind them,
but I can't
make them out
because this guy's
arm's in the way.
Can you?
No.
(SIGHS) All right,
you know what?
We'll ask Lewis, Ian,
and Erin if they remember.
Ok?
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?
I guess....
That kind of thing
is gonna happen to us
for the rest of our lives.
Yeah.
You know, I was gonna...
I was gonna ask her
to marry me.
Right after
graduation.
Heh.
(MOUSE CLICKING)
Oh.
WENDY: No, wait.
Look, behind Stacy.
That's Frank.
This picture shows
how he died.
WENDY: Ok, he's got
that hammer.
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...
On his head.
No, no, no,
but check this out.
Right now Lewis
is down at state
for football
training camp.
State's team is
called the sultans.
That's it.
That's the clue.
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.
Wouldn't you
want to know?
Wait, there's pictures
of us in there?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Huh. No.
No. I don't want
to see mine. No. Huh.
What about
willful ignorance?
Well, I'm full of shit,
all right?!
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death
before it happened, Wendy.
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but--
seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...
I gotta stay focused,
and if I look at that picture
all I'm gonna do is obsess.
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.
I mean, unless
we have to.
You mean until
we have to.
One more thing.
Is it bad?
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?
I'll see you
tomorrow.
You on crack.
Both of you.
Just listen, ok?
Ashley and Ashlyn
were first.
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the--
aw, come on, Kevin.
Listen.
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?
And there were
2 people in front of us.
Do you remember
who they were?
Fuck no,
and I don't care.
And you shouldn't
care either, man,
'cause what you're
tellin' me right now
is straight bullshit.
Just listen, Lewis.
LEWIS: Kevin,
it's like those stories.
Like this guy was killed by
a car he sold 10 years ago.
LEWIS: 2 sisters, right,
were killed when they were
driving to visit
each other.
You know,
shit like that, man.
MAN:
Fuck the bruins!
Oh, yeah!
Fuck the bruins!
Bruin faggots!
Yeah! Fuck the bruins!
(ECHOING)
Man, you're reading
into this shit
like them damn
urban legends.
3 people
have died, Lewis.
I mean, if you think
this can be written off
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there,
you're in serious denial.
Unh! What about
you two, huh?
What?
You both lost people
real close to you
in a fucked-up way.
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever,
seeing signs
and patterns, man.
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.
Unh! It's wrong.
That's denial.
Unh!
Unh!
You got it!
Ok, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?
Wendy saw it.
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense,
but she got a hunch.
Man, I'm here because
I get good hunches
before every down.
No, you know they're
either gonna run or pass.
Hers came to her
from nowhere.
You're here and alive
because of her.
No, I'm alive
because of me.
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.
Does that
make sense to you?
There's nothing to get,
Kevin! It's bullshit.

Don't, Wendy.
But why me?
All those people
out there
wanting to have
a premonition
or see a ghost or
whatever and I don't.
I just want it
to stop.
Just stop.
I don't know why,
Wendy,
but you didn't
do anything.
All right?
This is just--
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?
I wish I could--I could
come up with a guess even

Shit!
You scared

Yeah, wait till you hear

ERIN: Zip, it's Pip.
Come over here.
You are gonna trip

Well, paint me intrigued,
Pip, I'm on my way.
ERIN: So let me
get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D.
On nail Polish,
and Ian is gonna be
embarrassed to death?
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?
What's happened
to the others?
I mean, you just saw
their pictures.
IAN: Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!
Ha ha!
We need to know who
was sitting behind you
on the roller coaster.
Ok, who was sitting behind
us on the roller coaster?
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted
most likely to become
manager at red lobster?
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak,
I didn't see his face,
but, um,
the ride attendant
did take his sickle
before the ride started if
that's helpful in any way.
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?
This is our lives, ok?
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."
Ok, wait,
are you guys saying
that death
is, like, a person?
No. It's like--
like a force.
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.
IAN: I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that it is a force.
KEVIN: But there is
awareness, McKinley.
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved,
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.
IAN: Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?
(CHIMING)
ERIN: Ha ha!
Top shelf.
Ok.
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.
Ian, watch those boxes!
What the fuck, man? You said
those boxes were falling!
No, I said
watch the boxes.
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.
You haven't seen or been
through what we have...Yet.
Oh. Yet.
Ok, so who's next
in this theory
you have, me or Ian?
Well, we know the order
of how we were sitting
on the roller coaster,
but not how it works with
people who sat together.
Ok, we don't know if Ashley
or Ashlyn died first.
Hmm. Death is
fucking complicated.
Ha ha!
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.
It's simple.
People die.
That's just
part of life.
150,000 people
a day, actually.
You know? I mean,
we're biological entities,
and death is just--
top shelf.
The end of
biological function.
It's as simple as that.
How can you explain what
happened to us as simple?
I mean, if Wendy never
had that premonition
and none of us
had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.
Does that not
make sense to you?
IAN: Oh, yeah.
Kevin, how come when a guy
dies of a plain heart attack
no one goes, like,
"oh, wow, he was
eating French toast
"when princess Diana
died in Paris,
and then he saw her funeral
on TV, and now he's dead"?
You know why? Because
they'd sound crazy,
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting
those orders so
we can get out of here.
Ok!
(RATTLING)
(SCRAPING)
(WHIRRING)
(BUZZING)
(SAW WHINING)
Unh!
Heh heh!
Ugh!
Sick.
(CREAKING)
(BLOWS)
IAN: Ok.
Let's go with what
you guys are saying.
Let's just say,
you know,
that death does have
a conscious plan
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.
So, Newton's third
law of motion,
and, well, look,
I'm just guessing that
it goes for death, too,
when he's working
in our world.
Newton says
that every action
has an equal and
opposite reaction.
So, that means that
if death has taken
action so can we.
And that that action
we take might have
an opposite reaction that
thwarts death's intent.
You're being a fucker,
but go on.
Ok. Ok.
What if,
for example,
the last in line
were to make
the utilitarian choice...
Kill themselves.
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan
that death's put in motion.
And even better,
hey, it's gonna save
5 skipped lives.
Any takers?
(WIND BLOWS)
IAN: Nah,
I didn't think so.
There! Those!
Ugh!
WENDY: Aah!
Ooh!
Aah!
Unh! Unh!
(WHIMPERS)
Unh!
(WHIMPERS)
(SOBS)
Aah!
In our world.
They were trying to scare us
into saying something,
but they had nothing
to keep me there.
What'd you tell 'em?
Everything.
I didn't do anything.
I told them about
the pictures in the camera
and flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis
and why we went to see
Ian and Erin and--
did they
believe you?
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.
10 hours they
had us in there.
For all we know,
whoever was sitting behind
Erin is already dead.
And we're next.
Now.
Ian almost died first,
but we intervened.
So it skipped Ian.
That's...
That's how
we regain control.
If someone intercedes,
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.
All right,
wait, wait, wait.
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...
Well, I'm next...
And then you.
We can beat this.
We're so close.
We can't give up.
All right,
my dad's here.
He's gonna give me
a ride back.
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?
It's just for
a couple of hours.
All right?
A couple of hours.
Go back,
look at the pictures,
see if you can
find any more clues,
and I'll ask
everybody I see
if they know if anyone else
got off the ride.
Ok?
Was there something
I should know about going?
No, it's just...
I'll just be freaking out
every second,
hoping you're ok.
Why?
I mean, we don't even
like each other.
Heh.
Come here.

our grandmother
gave her.
Amber or Perry were

It's just me standing in

KEVIN: Ian? Is he
in the picture?
No, but it--
it feels like a clue.

You followed me!
IAN: Oh!
You are paranoid.
But, hey, I saw
what happened.
You're next, right?
You're the end of it,
aren't you?
Man, I would be
paranoid, too.
You didn't even
believe me!
Yeah, well,
seeing is believing.
Then you have to
stay away from me!
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.
Oh, no way.
Do I cause
your death?
Just like
you caused Erin's?
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what? What?
You have a vision?
Was I in it?
Was I in a picture?
Just tell me
how to start it off!
Let's get this
over with!
You'll save me if
you just stay away!
Then it'll
all be over!
What do I care?
It skipped me.
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.
I'm not dying!
Ha ha ha!
You see?
I'm not gonna die!
It's you, Wendy!
You're dead!

End of the line.
The next stop

Let's just walk.
It's freezing out.

Hey, man, peace out!
Come on.
Excuse me.

Did you see that?
This is it!
Yo, comin' through.
Excuse me.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
this. Here.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.
Well, dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday
so instead of sitting
around for a few hours
I lucked out and
caught an early train.
I hope I'm not
messing you up or--
no, no, it's just, um...
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.
(LOUD CLANK)
I was just...
I was feeling like
I did that night.
No. No, it's over.
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.
Ian was gonna
cause your death,
you intervened
and it skipped us.
(SQUEAKING)
(BUZZ)
(CLANK)
Look, I'm not worried.
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.
And, if I were you,
until something happens
to me and then Kevin,
you've got nothing
to worry about.
You're right.
(SIGHS)
Hey, I--I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, ok?
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
This is Julie, my--
what are you
doing here?
Wendy! Julie!
What are the chances?
How long have you
been on this train?
Uh, since home.
I was headin' up to
check out the game.
I was gonna look
you up afterwards.
KEVIN: You ok?
Is something wrong?
