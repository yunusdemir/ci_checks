Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...
When I pass the dagger
on to this Guardian,
whoever it may be,
the Darkness will finally rest.
And I will be reunited with Belle.
I wasn't the only one that
took a blood test that day.
I am Lucy's father.
Listen, I-I can still help you.
Just use your dark magic,
whatever, get me out of here,
and I'll kill any witch you like.
You're a wild card.
And I'm taking you out of the deck.
Can you hear me, Belle?
It's me.
I know it's only been a short time
since I began my journey without you...
but it feels like an eternity.
I received a letter from Gideon.
He's doing well in his studies.
Our son misses you, Belle...
terribly.
And so do I.
That's good.
Quite good.
Let it all out.
After all, there's no greater pain
than being separated from true love...
Especially for an immortal like you,
Dark One.
I don't know who you
are or why you're here.
But I suggest you go.
The name's Facilier and I came to help.
You see, anyone can come
here to talk to the dead.
It's hearing them that's the trick.
You came to ask Belle
if the girl you met,
named Alice, is truly the Guardian.
If you're really so interested
in surrendering your power,
perhaps I should take
it from you instead.
You honestly think a pin
cushion is gonna work on me?
Very well.
Now I get the chance to do... this.
If you truly can hear my wife,
then tell me, what did she say?
The Guardian has to be pure of heart.
But the only way to
know is to test Alice.
Belle says you have to hurry.
Why?!
Because she sees there's
still darkness in you,
and she's afraid that without her,
you'll succumb to it first.
Don't worry, Belle.
I'll find the Guardian in time.
I promise.
Oh, you better hope you do...
because if you don't,
I'll be there to pluck your
precious dagger from you.
Good luck, Dark One.
So what do we do when we
talk to this head case?
Do we call him Nick or is it "Hansel"?
Ah, it doesn't matter.
All he's gonna be responding to soon
is a number on the back
of an orange jumpsuit.
Should we get help?
I don't think we have to bother.
What the hell happened?
You think some kind
of medical condition?
No.
- There was someone here with him.
- How?
The door was locked,
and we're the only ones with a key card.
Lock down the building.
Now!
Where the hell are you going?
Hey, van Gogh. Whatcha drawing?
Wow. Very lifelike.
Uh, I don't know...
Can't seem to get him right today.
I woke up with this
terrible buzzing in my head.
Do you hear it?
I don't think so.
Great. Must be me, then.
You know what I think?
You need to get out of
your head a little bit.
It's good for the soul.
And just so happens that I
know the perfect way to do it.
Oh, yeah?
You are spending the day with me.
We're gonna do some
eating, some walking,
maybe some more eating.
I'm a big fan of food.
So, it's...
like a date?
I hope so,
or else I'm wasting a whole
lot of lip gloss right now.
So, what do you say?
Can you take a break from Mr. Sad Troll?
Yeah, why not?
I'm just so happy you didn't get hurt.
How did I make such a mistake with Nick?
You can't blame yourself, okay?
Nobody realized he was crazy.
Y-You still haven't told me much
about what he said to you.
Maybe talking about it would help.
Yeah.
Um, thank you, but to be honest, I...
I just don't think I'm ready yet.
Weaver, what the hell's going on?
I have a hunch who killed our suspect.
This one I intend to follow up on.
So I guess I'll take care of all
the actual, bloody police work, then.
Well, you go ahead.
Pull surveillance
footage, dust for prints,
follow whatever part
of "the book" you like.
Just don't get in my way.
What the hell's gotten into you?
I've never seen you like this.
Like what?
Scared.
Oh! Robin.
Alice.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here, one letter from your dad.
Oh.
And I also brought you this.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Everyone back home in
Storybrooke makes them,
and when you're finished,
you're supposed to find
someone to swap with.
Oh.
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna
be terribly disappointed,
because I don't have
anything for you in return.
Oh... Oh! No! Wait.
I do have this.
It's from one of my
adventures in Wonderland.
That's amazing.
I've never seen a watch
that moves backwards.
I wish I'd done as many
exciting things as you.
Yeah, well, as much fun
as traveling realms is,
I'm starting to learn you can
have a lot of other adventures
just staying put... good ones, too.
Well, I should get going.
Your dad will be wondering how you are.
I'll see you soon, Alice.
Yeah. I hope so.
I think Alice has had
enough visitors for one day.
See, I don't care
that everybody thinks
that you're a hero now,
including my less-dashing other self,
because I know the truth
of who you are, Crocodile.
Lower the blade, pirate.
I'm here to help.
You want to help her?
Heal my heart so my daughter
and I can be together again.
I can't.
Gothel used dark magic to curse you,
which means any solution
would be just as dark.
No loophole can get around that.
So what use are you to her at all?
And why are you bloody here?
I came to test Alice.
I believe she's destined
to become a great hero,
a protector
of the Dark One dagger
known as The Guardian.
So, that's what this is all about.
You've grown tired
of your bloody dagger,
realizing that immortality
isn't all it's cracked up to be,
but I don't care because
it'll be a cold day in Hell
when I let you saddle
my daughter with it
so she can take your place.
This isn't just about me.
Don't you think Alice should
have a say in all of this?
So you can manipulate her? No.
You saw her with Robin.
She's happy.
She finally has a
chance at a normal life.
And I won't let anyone,
including the Dark One,
threaten to take that away from her.
Now, if you know what's good for you...
you'll go.
Something wrong with the TV?
It's not the TV.
It's the hard drive for the
precinct's security system.
An electrical surge wiped it clean
the same time as our
serial killer's death.
Wow, that's...
that's some really bad timing.
Found these on the
printer... They yours?
Yeah. Thanks, Sam.
I did some digging,
and the bank's cameras across
the street were unaffected.
These are the stills
from the same time period.
Smart thinking.
Well, good luck.
Hey. Rogers.
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.
Henry.
I'm in the thick of it,
but I always have time
for my unofficial deputy.
How are you holding up?
To be honest, uh, not great.
You see, some of what Nick said to me,
it's kind of made me
question some things.
It's like I'm not sure what's real.
Don't doubt yourself, mate.
Nick was the crazy one, not you.
I know you're right,
and... and I know that
what I'm about to ask
probably breaks like a thousand rules,
but I was hoping that maybe
you'd let me talk to him.
Even if I wanted to, Henry, I couldn't.
I'm afraid Nick's dead.
What?
D-Do you know what happened to him?
Not yet.
But I may have found some leads.
And hopefully, I'll find
some more in Nick's apartment.
Uh, if... if you're going
there, take me with you.
There is something that
Nick showed me there.
If I can see it again, it
might help explain things.
I'm sorry, mate.
- You want to take about breaking rules...
- Please.
You know that you never
would've caught this guy
if it wasn't for me.
I'm telling you... I need this.
Fine.
Thank you.
Impressive-looking magic.
Would you mind if I
asked where it came from?
Weaver. Don't you knock?
I don't have time for pleasantries.
Just answer the question...
Where did it come from?
Samdi gave it to me to help heal Henry.
And I'm close.
Why? What's gotten into you?
Well, maybe you should
ask your boyfriend,
considering he kept some
of that for himself...
Then used it to kill Hansel
before stealing the Dark One Dagger.
No.
If you want to keep fooling
yourself, be my guest.
But he doesn't care about you...
Never did.
He just used you so he
could get close enough
to get what he really wanted from me.
- Get the hell out of here.
- No, no, no, not until I take something
to level the playing field.
No.
This is the only hope of healing Henry,
and you're not touching it.
Your desperate little
family reunion can wait.
Your son's been fine long
enough without your hugs.
He'll survive.
You mean your grandson?
Look, I know Belle's
death has been hard on you,
and I know you're yearning
to get back to her.
But this isn't the way.
Trust me.
Let me speak to Samdi.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Until then, don't do anything crazy.
This is the most delicious
thing I've ever eaten.
I had no idea you could candy on fruit.
You can put candy on anything
if you try hard enough.
It's a worthy goal.
So, what's next?
Actually, that's up to you.
I showed you a little taste
of my Hyperion Heights.
Show me something about yours.
I know just the place.
Huh.
Mom-and-pop bookshop...
Excellent choice.
Actually, it's pop-and-pop...
And this isn't even the best part.
This is one of my favorite
spots in the whole city.
Why's that?
Because from here you can
go anywhere in the world
without ever taking a step.
See?
Huh.
The is the best description of
a bookshelf I have ever heard.
Yeah, well, when your world is small,
you do anything you
can to make it bigger.
Probably sounds crazy
to someone who's actually seen things.
Not at all.
Let me tell you, there were lots of days
when traveling like this
would've been a hell of a lot easier...
Like any time I took a bus.
They almost always broke
down on the side of the road
in some tiny, little town,
usually while it was raining.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It happened so many times,
I started picking up
these little souvenirs.
I got this one in Thailand.
Ooh!
This one I got at this
amazing little village in Peru.
This one's my favorite.
I got this one in the farthest place
from Hyperion Heights you can go
before you start coming back.
Mm.
Wonder if I'll ever have
an adventure like that.
Oh, you will.
I can tell these things.
You are gonna have lots of adventures.
What do you think, Mr. Rabbit?
Do you like my bracelet?
Robin gave it to me,
and I don't plan to ever take it off.
Alice.
Rumplestiltskin?
I'm glad you're still awake.
I am, but you shouldn't be here.
I know we're friends... Or
at least we used to be...
But my papa wrote me a letter.
And he didn't say why,
but he warned me not to talk to you.
I know. Uh, that's why I waited
for a time he wasn't
watching to come see you.
W-What happened to your hand?
It's nothing.
What's important is you're right...
We are friends.
Which means if you
want me to go, I will.
I was simply hoping
to see you and your
father reunited again.
Wait.
Do you really have a
way to cure his heart?
Yes, I do.
You see, your father
thought the path was too dangerous,
but I know how painful it is
to be separated from
the person you love.
And I thought you should
have the opportunity
to decide for yourself.
I'm glad you came.
So where do we find this cure?
Well, it's in the possession
of a very powerful witch
doctor named Facilier.
And I have to warn you
he won't give up that
magic without a fight.
But I have a plan.
Good, 'cause I'll do whatever it takes.
Now, where's my cloak?
Yes.
I killed Nick.
But surely...
you're not going to shed tears
over the untimely death of
a serial killer, are you?
How I'm feeling isn't the issue.
I'm here about the dagger.
What about it?
It's missing.
And I need to know if you took it.
And if you did,
I'm just asking you to return it.
This is about more than...
whatever we have between us.
I know exactly what it's about.
Or rather who it's about.
The Dark One.
Have you noticed
it's always him slithering
between you and me?
Have you asked yourself why that is?
Do you have his dagger or not?
I was clear
that when I came back to the Heights,
it was to get that dagger.
Don't make me ask you a third time.
All right.
Then the truth is I don't have it.
Now, you can decide
to believe me or not.
The choice is yours.
Thank you. I do believe you.
I should go.
Will I see you later?
Maybe.
Hello, Dark One.
If you've been here,
then you know I don't have
what you're looking for.
Well, Roni may believe you, but me?
I know better.
I'd say it's time we had a little chat.
Hello?
Dragon's Fire.
One drop burns the
fingernails right off.
Interested?
No, thanks.
Uh, I was actually hoping
to speak to some dead.
I heard you could do that.
Well, I don't really
talk so much as listen.
And do you know what
they're saying right now?
That you're not here to talk at all.
The dead... Always so perceptive.
Dark One.
Sending little girls to
do your dirty work now?
Well, what can I say?
Always love a good loophole.
Don't move!
That's a good girl.
You'll pay for this.
So, what do we do now,
just order him to give up the magic?
Oh, we don't have to.
All we need is right there.
You know, the only cure
for a poisoned heart
is to sacrifice someone else's.
So if you want to save your father...
you have to crush his heart.
So you found who you were looking for,
and I'm the test.
How convenient.
What test?
Nothing. Silence him.
- Listen to me, little girl...
- Just shut up!
Oh, I'm not sure if I can do this.
Oh, I-I-I know it's hard.
Let me help you.
All you have to do is start.
One little twitch of a finger,
and I'll finish the job.
Crush.
Over before you know it.
Just one little twitch, Alice.
One. Little. Twitch.
No. No, sorry!
I just can't!
Alice.
Alice, wait.
You knew I was gonna have to do that.
You should've told me!
I-I couldn't, because...
well, then you wouldn't have come,
and I had to know.
Know what?
Well, I've been searching for someone...
A very powerful person
who's gonna do something
far greater than anyone
has ever done before.
And, Alice, that person...
is you.
So, it seems Roni was right
to be concerned about you.
Let's leave her out of this.
This is between you and me.
Fine.
Well, feel free to look
around. I have nothing to hide.
I don't expect to find anything here.
You're smarter than that.
Wherever you put that dagger,
you've hidden it well.
Now you are gonna tell me where it is.
You pull that trigger,
you don't get back
to that sweet, little
wife on the Other Side...
If she's even still waiting for you.
I'm betting that's a risk
you're not willing to take.
I will find where
you've put that dagger...
however I have to.
I'm sure that's true.
But the next time you threaten me,
you better follow through.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, let's just get this over with.
I should warn you,
even if you do find what
it is you're looking for,
it likely won't be
the, uh, revelation that you're hoping.
I just want the truth.
The truth can be complicated, Henry,
especially when it comes to the
mind of a deranged psychopath.
Is that what you're looking for?
Someone's here?
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Stay there.
You don't have to do this.
I'm one of the good guys.
Is that why I've got pictures of
you outside a potential murder scene?
I'm in danger, same as Nick was.
I was looking for
something to protect myself.
From who?
Baron Samdi... The guy who killed him.
You mean the person
that you were helping?
I didn't have a choice.
That's why I came here.
I figured Samdi must've killed Nick
because he had something on him,
and maybe if I could find it,
I could use it to protect myself.
If you're so afraid of this Samdi,
then why not just come to the police?
You saw what happened to the other guy.
Samdi's powerful...
In ways you can't even possibly imagine.
Try me.
You'll think I'm crazy if I tell you.
But look at the M.E.'s report
on your dead killer.
Look at it good,
because what happened to him...
that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Sorry.
I got waylaid by some
hot chocolate... so yummy.
I may never leave this place.
Oh, look what else I found.
- Is that one of yours?
- No.
It's one of yours.
I saw it at the counter,
and it reminded me of
you for some reason.
I know we aren't exactly in Thailand,
but this felt like an adventure to me.
I love it.
Oh. What is that?
What is what?
What's that buzzing, like
this morning but louder.
- Ahh. You can't hear that?
- No, I... But it's okay.
- I'll go get some water.
- No, I don't need water!
I need it to stop!
Sorry.
Sorry. I didn't mean that.
I can't do this right now.
Wait. No! Tilly!
No, I-I have to go.
I'm sorry.
Is that her?
Your wife?
It must have been a great love story.
She saw the best in me
when no one else could,
- including myself.
- Hmm.
Robin was the first person
to see something special in me, too.
Not sure I would've
seen it if she hadn't.
What do you think it's like there,
where your Belle is?
I don't know.
I hope it's somewhere
where you get to be with
the people you love forever,
and you don't have to
think about life anymore.
That's how it should be,
'cause I know what it's like
to watch the world go
by and not be in it.
It's terribly lonely.
Yes, it is.
Suppose I won't have
to worry about that now.
I'm in the world forever...
No more towers for me.
So, how do we do it?
I'm not sure.
It's... It's never been done before.
I-I think the dagger knows.
It's trying to tell me.
You're a good man, Rumple.
Your heart is pure.
You will find the answer you
need to get rid of the dagger.
And you will find your way
back to me again... I promise.
- No!
- Aah!
What did you do?
I did what I had to.
I made a promise that
when I passed this on,
it wouldn't be a burden.
And that's exactly
what it will be for you.
I don't understand.
Immortality...
is just another tower.
You deserve better than that.
You're gonna fall in love,
grow old with someone,
live a normal life free of towers.
But what will happen to you?
I guess I'll just have
to find another way,
even if that means
I'll lose the battle with
the darkness to do so.
No, you won't.
I won't let that happen, no matter what.
I know who you really are,
and I won't let you forget it.
Weaver!
I'm so glad to see
you. Can you hear that?
Tilly, please, not now.
I-It's different this time.
I-I thought it was a
buzzing, but it's not.
I realize now... It... it's a voice.
Can you hear it?
It's trying to tell me something,
but I don't know what it is.
How long have you been
hearing this voice?
Since this morning.
What is that?
Did you take this?
No! I don't know how that got in there.
Tilly, I'm not playing games.
Did you break into the
evidence locker and take this?!
No! I swear I didn't! I-I
wasn't even near there.
I...
Wait.
Wait, the voice... It just...
It just stopped.
It's that, isn't it?
I don't understand.
It's all right. I-I do.
You were guarding it for me.
Are you angry with me?
No, Tilly.
You're not the one I'm angry with.
Dark One.
I heard about what you
did for Alice and Robin.
All magic comes with a price.
Guess it was finally my turn to pay.
Well, I just wanted to tell you
everyone was right about you.
You're not the Crocodile I knew.
I owe you a great debt.
If I can ever repay you, I will.
Dark One and a pirate...
friends?
Perhaps it's time for a new story.
So, what are you gonna do now?
Do what Rumplestiltskin
does best, of course...
Spin, spin, spin!
Spin, spin, spin.
Spin, spin,
spin, spin, spin, spin,
spin, spin, spin, spin...
That was the only bit of
magic I had to cure Henry.
And you knew that!
You stole it anyway, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
So lemme guess...
You used it to find
your precious dagger?
Actually, the Guardian did.
The Guardian?
I thought Anastasia was the Guardian.
We sent her back with Ivy.
She was a potential Guardian.
There was another before her,
and today, she made sure
the dagger was kept safe.
Safe.
So the dagger was never
in danger to begin with.
So everything you did
today was for nothing?
Look, if you want to be angry, be angry.
You certainly have the right.
But I did what I had to do.
You know, after everything
we've been through...
I thought you could trust
me enough to help you.
But instead, you went behind my back
and betrayed me to get what you want,
like you always do
and continue to put
Henry's life at risk.
No matter what you tell yourself,
you haven't changed a bit.
And I'm done with it.
You and I...
we're through.
Thought you could use this
after what happened with that Drew guy,
and I wanted to say thanks again
for bringing me there today.
Of course. I was happy to.
Did it help?
I don't know yet.
Uh...
Kind of hard to explain...
Not really sure you'd
believe me if I could.
People keep saying that to me today.
But after everything that's happened,
I might just believe anything.
Why's that?
This is the M.E.'s report on Nick.
According to them, our
lawyer turned serial killer
was stabbed through
the heart one time...
from the inside.
What?
Well, how's that even possible?
Well, I'm no medical
expert, but I'd say it's not.
And the question is,
what the hell is going on in this town?
Turns out you were right...
You really can put candy on anything.
I see that.
Okay.
So, here's the thing about me.
I'm never quite sure what
kind of day it's gonna be.
Sometimes I wake up and
the whole day is good,
and then...
sometimes it's not.
And I don't want you to
see the not-good days.
Not yet...
Because it can be a bit
too much for some people.
I get that.
But you don't have to worry
because it won't be too much for me,
no matter what kind of day it is.
You dropped this on your
way out of the store.
Can I?
Mm.
There.
It's beautiful.
Now, then, how 'bout a drink?
Absolutely.
Henry?
Hey.
Um, I know it's late, but can I come in?
O-Of course.
What is it?
Okay, so this morning
when you asked me about Nick?
Well, more important
than anything he said
was something he showed me.
What do you mean?
Okay, remember when
Lucy was in the hospital
and I gave blood in
case I could help her?
Yeah.
Well, they ran a whole
bunch of tests, right,
and Nick had the results,
including one...
that just didn't make any sense.
I called the hospital as
soon as I got my hands on it.
It's real.
I-I-I don't understand.
I don't, either, but, Jacinda,
according to that,
Lucy's been right this whole time.
I am her father.
