Spring 1860: Sakurda Gate Incident -
Naosuke, a government official in favour of
reforms, is assassinated.
Grandfather! Hurry! Hurry!
We're at The Pass. At last.
A small shrine.
Grandfather, it's downhill from here?
Yes.
Many years ago...
An exalted saint stood on this spot .
He prayed that the waters...
...falling to the east and west would be pure.
And he buried Buddha's image here.
The water falling to the east became
Tamagawa River.
To the west it became
Fuefuki River.
Flowing continually...
They helped the people to raise rich crops.
Omatsu, it's all downhill from here.
We should be able to reach Kochi by nightfall.
We'll be in Edo in three days.
This is lovely.
Lets eat our lunch here.
Grandfather, bamboo filler.
Yes, it’s empty. I drank it all.
Coming up, I heard the sound of water.
I'll go and get some.
Be careful, now.
Save us, merciful Buddha
If a burden like me could only die...
...she'd be happy.
And she wouldn't have to be a pilgrim.
Merciful Buddha.
Please be merciful and let me die soon...
Old man.
You're a pilgrim?
Yes, I am with my granddaughter.
Step forward.
Turn and look west.
- A fine day.
- Wait.
You're an unfamiliar face.
Where are you from?
I'm Shichibei from Hikawa.
Grandfather!
What is it?
Grandfather!
What happened?
How cruel!
Why such an old man...
It must be the work of an expert swordsman.
Grandfather!
Young Master!
- What is it?
- A thief!
What?
Disguised as a peddler!
There's no use following him.
He's passed Dai-bosatsu Pass...
Koshu Highway by now.
He only stole 20 ryo.
Nothing to scream about.
Ryunosuke, that was imprudent of you
when you have a match tomorrow.
Where did you go so early?
I took a leisurely walk to the pass.
Then you've decided?
Ryunosuke, let Utsugi win tomorrow.
You were expelled by instructor Henmi.
So it's no disgrace to lose.
If Bunnojo Utsugi loses, he can't graduate to
the Kogen Ittoryu School of fencing.
Moreover, if Bunnojo wins the match...
Lord Itakura will make him...
...the Clan fencing instructor.
So not only Bunnojo but all his kith and kin...
...have staked everything on tomorrow's match.
You understand, Ryunosuke?
Lose to him with good grace.
You've a singular form of your own.
Don't cling to the Kogen style.
I do not fully understand your sword form.
You draw out your opponent.
Then, in an unguarded
moment, you cruelly...
The cruelty does not stop with your sword.
It's seeped into your whole mind and body.
It really frightens me.
A visitor. To see the young master.
No more contests today.
It is not a swordsman, but a lady.
A woman?
How do you do?
You are Ryunosuke, the fencing instructor here?
That's right.
I am Hama, Utsugi's sister.
I have heard that he has a brother
named Hyoma, but not a sister.
I am Hama, his younger sister.
I see. You wished to see me about something?
It's about the fencing match
tomorrow at Mt. Mitake.
You see, my hus...
I mean, my brother is very worried about it.
You see, for the last few days...
...he has been unable to eat or sleep.
My brother is no match for you.
You both studied at the Henmi School.
But he says your sword skill
is much greater than his.
I am sorry you are to be his opponent.
I just cannot bear watching him.
And also, if he should lose...
...and be disgraced in the coming match...
...he must leave the Kogen School
and forfeit his position.
It would mean ruin for the entire Utsugi family.
I came to plead with you to be merciful...
...and save his honour.
Please! Please!
It all depends on chance.
We must fight first.
Then you will not let him win?
Your concern for your family and hus...
I mean your brother... I know how you feel.
But a match is another thing.
Ryunosuke, even if I beg you to?
I trust only my sword in this world.
When I fight, I have no family.
What a cruel thing to say!
You have no heart!
To a samurai, for example, martial art is
like a woman's chastity.
Even for one's own family....
Even if it means ruin and death for one's family?
You would surrender your chastity?
Who is it?
Please excuse me.
Ryunosuke told me to come.
He wishes to talk to me. He said to wait here.
Is that so?
But I don't see why he has to
talk in a dirty place like this.
Please come and sit here.
I'm alone, so can't even offer you tea.
I’m sorry.
That's not important.
I've got some work left.
Yohachi
It's Young Master.
Yohachi. Leave.
I must talk to her. You're in the way.
But I've got work...
You can do it later!
Leave.
Don't return for about two hours.
Ohama, stand up.
I promise to lose to Bunnojo in the match.
Stand up.
Untie your sash.
Ryunosuke....
Untie it!
"Mt. Mitake Command Match"
Utsugi Bunnojo, Kogen Style
Vs.
Tsukue Ryunosuke, Former Kogen Style
Hama.
Hama!
It's still a little too early to start yet.
If you're so nervous already...
Take this!
Letter of Divorce
A divorce?
We're divorced!
Go back to your parents!
You go too far even in jest!
Why must I...?
Enough. Ask yourself why.
Yesterday, you said you'd go to pray so I’d win.
On the way, you had Kyusaku wait.
What did you do?
What did you do for two hours alone
with Ryunosuke in that water mill?
I... I... !
Say no more!
Thought it smart to go to his home, did you?
Just when...
...I'd found peace of mind by thinking...
...win or lose, I'd abide by the rules.
But not now! Not now!
I'll be without pity.
I'll definately kill him.
Even if we both die in the attempt!
Game!
Hijikata won?
I thought it was a draw.
No, he won. No mistake.
Ohno's sword missed his opponent...
....by about two inches to the side.
But Hijikata's sword was within...
...half an inch of Ohno's shoulder.
Your eyes are very sharp.
I'm Kamo Serizawa, of the Mito Tengu Group.
That, however, was long ago.
As time passes, our ideas change.
Our motto is "Save the Shogunate" now.
I'm going to Edo.
We hope men like you will help us.
What's your name?
I'm a Bushu country samurai;
Isami Kondo
Bunnojo Utsugi of
the Kogen Ittoryu School!
Ryunosuke Tsukue, formerly of
the same fencing school!
Bunnojo Utsugi.
Ryunosuke Tsukue.
You both harbor no grudges?
Do your best in the match!
Commence!
This is no ordinary match!
It's a duel!
A draw!
Neither side won! It's a draw!
Judge, do you call this match a draw?
Yes, that's right. Neither side won.
Are you too old to see?
Before a draw was called...
...he came at me with an illegal thrust.
I parried it and got a facer.
Take a look and reconsider.
Ryunosuke.
Ryunosuke.
Don't take this road!
Its an ambush!
Kogen School men lie in wait...
five here, seven there.
It was not a grudge match.
But...
30 to 40 men are scattered about!
And why are you telling me?
Ryunosuke.
My brother...
...no, my husband, Bunnojo Utsugi, is dead.
I was divorced by Utsugi this morning!
I have no place to go!
Please take me away with you!
Hurry! Hurry!
Run away with me! Escape!
Ryunosuke!
We won't let you get away
We'll get even for Bunnojo!
You mean you want revenge?
- Don't you deserve it?
- No!
What did you say?
Bunnojo Utsugi died in a fair match.
No one should bear me a grudge.
If anyone calls me his enemy...
...it should be Hyoma, Bunnojo's brother.
Spring 1862: Sakashita Gate Incident -
Ando Nobumasa, another official in favour
of reforms, is attacked.
It's been only two years.
But it seemed like a long time to me.
After many twists and turns,
I've found a place in the sun.
I owe a great deal to you.
Let me thank you again.
You know, Yoshida...
If things go well tonight...
...I'll become an assistant leader.
Leader Kiyokawa promised me.
Who do we kill?
Kojima, Sakashita Gate Incident survivor...
...and Ohashi, who's pulling the strings.
Ohashi's only a scholar.
But Kojima's the Yashu Clan's best
swordsman. He'll be hard to kill.
I thought of getting Kondo and Hijikate.
But we don’t need the aid of those country clods.
Kiyokawa's place at 6 p.m.
Understand?
For so little payment, you...
One after another...
You become grimmer, bloodier, and
more cruel each time.
In better times...
...you'd have had a big fencing school...
...and we could have lived well.
We might be outcasts, but this child....
I don't care what becomes of us.
But this boy...
I wish to save Ikutaro from misery.
You hate being with me?
Never say "outcast" to me again.
My baby, It's Boys' Festival,
but I can't even fly a cloth carp for you.
So let's at least offer Buddha incense.
You were born under an unlucky star.
That's the reason we both suffer...
We'll offer Bunnojo incense in apology.
If only nothing had happened...
...and I lived with Bunnojo.
If I were his wife,
I wouldn't live in misery or with a heavy heart.
Women are selfish creatures.
What are you saying?
You're to blame for everything!
If it weren't for an evil person like you...
...Bunnojo would be alive.
And both his family and yours would be safe.
- I would have been happy.
- You're wrong.
You're at the bottom of it.
You caused Bunnojo's death....
... and you ruined me.
What?
A woman named Hama made it a violent match.
Bunnojo's sword tip wreaked of vengeful love....
My sword, too, seemed possessed...
...by the obsession of an evil woman.
It all started with a woman named Hama.
How dare you say that!
You're an evil woman.
No... A devil.
I'm glad you said that!
Yes, I'm a devil!
I’ll become one if you want it so much!
My son! I am going to die!
Die... Die with me!
Stop it!
Die or live!
As you like!
"Toranosuke Shimada"
That's all.
Next.
Excuse me!
A stranger at the entrance requests a match.
Show him in.
Wait...
A man of another school requests a match.
I'm Ryutaro Yoshida, a raw swordsman.
I would like Instructor Shimada to teach me.
We have rules concerning strangers.
A match with my pupil first.
Yes, I understand.
The one who won by a splendid Doh attack.
You knew just by listening?
Very well.
He is interested in your Doh attack.
This is my assistant instructor.
I am fortunate.
You're not changing?
No need.
I will do the same.
Its over!
Please let me try once more!
No, the match is over.
Yoshida.
You use a peculiar form.
Where did you study fencing?
I studied the Ono Ittoryu style
under my father.
That's about all I was taught.
Now, I would like you to teach me.
Would you please.
By your School's rules, I've faced your assistant.
I desire a match with you now.
There's no point in having a match.
Besides, I'm not good at Doh attacks
I push, he retreats;
I retreat; He lowers his sword.
Seemingly off-guard, yet alert.
How can I defeat his form?
I push, he retreats;
I retreat; He lowers his sword.
Only the thrust, perhaps, can defeat him.
Excuse me.
You'll get wet there.
Won't you please come inside?
But...
It's quite O.K.
It's just a shower.
It'll clear up soon.
May I stay here awhile?
I'm Instructor Shimada's pupil, Hyoma Utsugi.
- Omatsu! What are you doing?
- Coming
Sorry, please excuse me.
Flower arrangement?
Who were you talking to? A friend?
No. A passer-by, but I felt sorry for him.
He seemed like a samurai.
You mustn't keep bad company.
You are to serve a Lord.
Yes, but...
What a spoiled child!
He'd be attracted to you...
...and then you could live in luxury.
But I'd rather not....
You're not a child anymore!
Don't be so willful!
I’ve looked after you two years to...
- What is it?
- It's Shichibei...
Uncle Shichibei?
Uncle? How nice!
I haven't seen him for ages!
Have him come here.
He says he's wet.
He wants to see Omatsu in the kitchen.
This is from him for you.
Then hurry. Go.
Uncle!
Little Omatsu!
Sit down.
I was away eight months this time?
You've grown up while I was away.
I'd like us to live together.
But I'm on the road so much
selling everyday goods.
You're on my mind, though,
no matter where I am.
There's something I must tell you.
We'd like to have a little chat.
And the rain's cleared up, so...
Take your time.
What is it you wanted to tell me?
Have you found a nice young man?
No, my flower arranging teacher says to go to
Lord Kamio's mansion.
Lord Kamio's mansion?
I believe she was the late Lord's mistress.
She hopes you'll catch Lord Kamio's eye.
You're counting your chickens
before they're hatched.
- Don't worry.
- But Uncle...
She teaches flower arrangement,
so only women come here.
Lord Kamio's a Hatamoto, so young
Hatamoto samurai will go there.
You may meet a fine man.
You must marry some day.
It may be a good idea for you to go.
Yes, but...
But...?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
I’ll go if you think it's a good idea.
Yes, that would be best.
I'm staying in Edo a while.
If you go to serve Lord Kamio...
...I'll visit you from time to time.
Please, please, come to see me.
He's coming. Prepare yourself.
Ohashi and Kojima left Mito Mansion.
Pretty soon now.
Any passengers left?
The boat's leaving!
Wait, boatman! We're coming.
What're they doing, anyway?
Yoshida!
I'll wait on the boat.
I'm quitting early tonight!
Hurry, please, or I won't wait!
Wait, boatman!
Leader Ohashi!
- Kojima.
- What?
You're good at the Doh attack.
Hama, any sake left?
Yes, a little.
Give me what's left.
Shionoyama....
Sashide no Iso...
You know it?
It's a song about my home village.
Shionoyama means salt mountain.
Sashide no Iso means the banks
of the Fuefuki River....
...which flows from my village, Yahata.
My father loved the bamboo flute, too.
He was a stubborn swordsman.
The sword was all he knew.
But strangely, he also loved the flute.
I play a little, too, imitating him.
He was sick when I left home.
Is he well now, or has he died?
Ohama, shall we go home?
We'll go by Koshu, not the Ohme Highway.
From Yahata, your home village...
...we'll go through Dai-bosatsu Pass.
I'd be happy to go.
But what if something happens?
It won't.
It was nothing serious, just a fencing match.
No one could stay hostile for so long.
Wait...Bunnojo had a brother?
He came to Edo as a boy.
To enter the Otani school in Koishikawa.
There is no Hyoma Utsugi at that fencing school.
I was uneasy.
So I checked his whereabouts.
Then he must have gone home.
The others may not, but from what happened,
I'm sure he will...
Hyoma Utsugi...?
Let him stalk.
I'll kill him before he gets his revenge.
Poor man.
If I killed him, would you feel sorry for him?
No.
I have no one else to depend on but you.
You mean more to me than anyone else.
But to kill Hyoma who's done nothing...
It's cruel. I hope it never happens
You're early.
Spent all night gambling.
There was a suspicious man at your gate.
A man about 25 or 26, with clear-cut features?
And fencing gear?
Well... There's something between you two?
Not me.
It's Omatsu he's after.
But she's at Lord Kamio's place.
He peeks in twice a day when he passes by.
He doesn't know she's gone.
A curious, stupid fellow.
Do you think Omatsu all right?
Why do you ask?
Rumors say Lord Kamio's a woman-hater.
Until now that is.
He's his father's son.
He won't be able to do without them soon.
That is, as soon as Omatsu is near him.
I see what you mean.
I must convince the advisers of the Shogun...
...to send your Shinco men to Kyoto.
Yes, if you will.
What will you do in Kyoto?
The masterless samurai are up to something.
We must stop it.
Leader Kiyokawa thinks differently.
He's no longer a leader or member.
He plays both sides...
Don’t believe him.
I’ll get rid of him soon.
I'm not interested in politics at all.
You don't mind that the Shogunate's
becoming weak?
The Shogunate won't fall.
If it falls, it falls. Let it.
Things happen, regardless of what we do.
Enjoy yourselves until then.
I'll pour some sake. Relax here.
You take things too seriously.
No, we have a meeting.
I see.
I'm sorry I wasn't of any help.
That Kamio's a monster!
I thought he had guts! He's rotten!
He's smart and he enjoys himself.
He talks like a man when he can't
even make advances to women.
Yoshida...Yoshida!
What is it?
I'll remain here. Go on ahead.
I've got some business to attend to.
You go on ahead.
Yohachi
Young Master, it's you?
How...I mean why are you here?
No whys about it!
What?
Master died!
How could I stay in Sawai?
Father?
I was an orphan.
Master took me in.
I looked after his water mill.
So when he died...
When was it?
It's all your fault.
About 20 days after the match at Mt. Mitake...
Hyoma, returned home to Wada.
Master called the brother of the
man you killed to his bedside!
What?
Hyoma, with your own hands...
...kill Ryunosuke as soon as possible.
If only he had not been born...
No, he should never have held a sword.
He was fascinated by evil, even though he
knew better, and he debased himself.
There is no way to save him.
The sooner he dies...
...the sooner people can live in safety again.
But your sword skill is not enough yet to...
I hear you're studying at the Otani School.
But Otani is old.
I will write you a letter of introduction...
Take it to Shimada's School in Okachi-machi.
Toranosuke Shimada's Jikishin Kageryu School.
There's no one else who can...
...make you as strong as Ryunosuke.
Hyoma!
Enter Shimada's School.
As soon as possible...
With your hands...kill Ryunosuke!
I see now. I understand.
Yohachi.
Tell Hyoma at the Shimada School for me....
...that Ryunosuke Tsukue, his enemy,
lives behind Shiba Iikura.
He's Ryutaro Yoshida now, and he...
...helps the Shincho Group for money.
If he challenges me, I'll fight anytime.
I'll kill the poor man with one stroke.
No, I Won't!
I hate killing! No!
I won't kill you, Omatsu.
Let's play...the bamboo game.
The bamboo game?
We'll play that you're the bamboo.
Understand?
No. You wouldn't, naturally.
Bamboo can't see anything through its layers
...just like the masses.
Loyalists, Shogunate supporters...
Each time they flash their steel,
a layer comes off. Its dangerous.
This game is stupid but fun, Omatsu.
Here I go...I'm Bamboo!
Omatsu.
We can't play this much longer.
The samurai will soon
become useless and fall.
The bamboo will grow and become strong.
Now is the time!
First... Your sash!
Do you see?
And now your band!
It's a difficult thing to cut!
Here I go!
Omatsu, I was wrong!
He's a monster! Run away!
Ryutaro Yoshida's is in fact
Ryunosuke Tsukue?
That's right!
Strange...
That's the silent form?
That's right!
Then Ryunosuke knew who you were?
He came to test you?
No, it was just by chance.
I suppose so.
There's only one way...
...to defeat him. The thrust technique.
Master Shimada!
You haven't the slightest chance of defeating
Ryunosuke yet.
Leave your place. Shut yourself up here.
You must not go out!
Sword skill cannot be taught.
You must master it yourself.
You understand, Hyoma?
As you said, only the thrust can defeat him.
I think your brother Bunnojo used it too.
But if you use it poorly,
he'll use that weakness to kill you.
Work only on the thrust technique.
Think up new variations.
No matter when you challenge him...
...Ryunosuke won't run away.
She's not here?
Omatsu's gone?
She left Kamio's place in about 10 days.
I had no choice.
So I sent her to a wholesale store as a maid.
You told me about that when
I came in early autumn.
They were nice. They said she
was good, and that she was happy.
Then last month, she suddenly returned.
I asked her why, but she wouldn't say.
I got angry at her
and treated her harshly.
Then about 10 days ago when I got up,
she was gone; not in the house.
It made me so mad and bitter!
She's such a bother!
I asked you to look after her.
Just saying she’s gone, I...
Are you trying to blame me?
You're her guardian even though
you went through an agency.
As her guardian, bring her back!
I'm sorry. It was a slip of the tongue.
Please don't be offended.
But where did she go?
Have you any idea where she went?
If I knew, I'd bring her back.
She probably found a man...
...and went home with him.
Sugiyama's home in Marunouchi?
No doubt. My friend Saura is there.
He told Aoyama.
Who's there?
Lord Takahashi, Yamoaka,
Ishizaka, Asaka...
And Kiyokawa, the man we want.
Very well.
We'll take care of him tonight.
Or we can't leave for Kyoto in good spirits.
Yoshida, you can make full use
of your Silent Form, tonight.
But first, a drink!
Pour some for Yoshida.
Please.
Was that a mouse?
I heard a noise downstairs.
Its nothing.
Snow falling off the roof.
Cold out, isn't it?
Are you a thief?
I came to thank you.
You chased me away today!
You're...?
That's right. I'm a criminal.
Just the once, to make up for all my crimes,
I saved her at Dai-bosatsu Pass.
But my feelings for her deepened.
And now, I feel like a real father to her.
I wanted money to retire.
I looked forward to holding
Omatsu's children on my lap!
Where'd you hide her?
I told you earlier today.
Is that so?
I understand.
All right, I'll bring you plenty of shame.
I'll strip and tie you both up....
...and put you out in the street.
Spare me! Spare me!
I'll tell you everything!
I sold Omatsu to a place in Kyoto!
What's that? In Kyoto?
He brought a buyer.
She'd be found in Edo. Kyoto was better.
Where in Kyoto?
Shimabara!
You fiend!
Sinking Omatsu into a mire like that!
You broke all my dreams, too!
He's left Sugiyama's place?
Yes! We're lucky!
Two sedans have left.
Our man's in the second one.
You're sure?
Saura said two sedans would leave.
Our man would be in the second one.
Who's in the first one?
Lord Takahashi.
Takahashi?
The foremost lancer in Japan.
Who's afraid? Let's kill them both!
No, we're after Kiyokawa alone.
We'll follow them discretely.
When they part, we will attack Kiyokawa.
And what if they don't?
We'll kill them both.
Very well. Its settled.
To prepare for our journey to Kyoto...
Our leaders, Serizawa and Kondo,
will go to see Superintendent Nishino.
So I'll give the orders for killing Kiyokawa.
Takahashi's gone.
- Leader!
- Not yet!
Too many houses! At Mt. Ueno!
Now!
Wha... What is this? A joke?
Come out!
I'm Shimada Toranosuke of Okachi-machi!
Time and place if it's a challenge!
You have a grudge against me?
Tell me your reason!
It's a mistake!
You're too rude even if it is a mistake!
What are you names? Your reasons?
I demand an apology!
Who are you? What is your name?
Kill me!
You're the leader, it seems!
Your hot-headed men made me kill
against my will!
The men lying here were good swordsmen!
Dying like dogs!
How can you atone for it? Fool!!
Kill me!
It was a mistake! Kill me!
The sword is the soul.
Study the soul to study the sword.
An evil mind, an evil sword.
The Shincho Group's going to Kyoto.
Ryunosuke may accompany them.
Master!
You're not strong enough.
But if he goes to Kyoto, it'll make it
hard to kill him.
At the moment, he seems to have lost confidence
in his sword.
Don't ask me why.
Now's the time.
You should be ready to die too.
The thrust though, may give you a slight edge.
Challenge him by courier mail.
He lives at Shiba Iikura.
The date of the duel?
Tomorrow, the 16th.
Place: Pine grove to the right of Zojoji Temple.
The time: at 6 a.m. to avoid people.
Hama, give me some sake.
It's all gone.
You've been acting strangely since last night.
Ikutaro has a cold, yet you went out.
What did you do until so late...
...and where were you in all that snow?
He's fast asleep.
I hope he grows up safely.
Of course he will. Won't you, son?
Children grow up even without parents.
So they say.
Don't say that! It's unlucky!
One day, one day, I promise...!
I am going to Kyoto soon.
To Kyoto?
With Serizawa and the Shincho Group.
What will become of us?
No! You mustn’t go!
Stop saying things so suddenly.
You think nothing of us?
You don't care what becomes of us.
You're Ikutaro's father aren't you?
With a cold like this...
What if he becomes worse and dies?
Are you saying you don't care?
You're going to abandon us aren't you?
I knew it might come to this.
But it's too cruel, too brutal!
Please do me a favour!
I cannot stand the prolonged agony!
Please divorce me!
No, we’re not formally married.
I need no divorce papers! I'll leave now!
Where to?
You can't order me around!
Its not that. I wanted to give you a farewell gift.
But I have none.
So a final word before we part ways...
At 6 a.m. tomorrow morning...
...near Shiba Zojoji Temple...
I'll kill Hyoma Utsugi.
This is what happened this evening?
Hyoma's challenge.
Bunnojo, now Hyoma.
I will kill both brothers.
Please do! You are like that!
Kill Hyoma!
Kill everyone! Kill everyone in the world!
No, not everyone.
But my sword will get Toranosuke
Shimada one of these days.
I'll toy with Hyoma until I kill him.
You're still up?
You talked to Yohachi, the water mill worker,
from Ryunosuke's father's place?
Yes, to be here at 4 in the morning.
You'll lose sleep if you're obsessed with winning.
Don't try to win and live.
Be prepared to die.
Risk all, and you may have a chance.
Go to your room and lie down.
Ryunosuke's form is about to be defeated.
What are you doing...?!
Mad woman!
You tried to... for Hyoma's sake...
No! You're wrong! You're wrong!
What?
I wanted to kill you!
I hated you!
If it weren't for you...
...Ikutaro and I could be happy!
But not any more.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Ryunosuke, please kill me here.
Here... at your hands...
So you die by Hyoma's hands.
In recompense for Bunnojo.
You'll be making amends.
Ryunosuke.
Spring 1863: The Shinsen Group
is formed by conservative samurai.
You don't want to return to Edo?
No. I don't have any relatives there.
You're becoming a courtesan?
At the end of the month...
...I'll be courtesan Miyuki's sister at Kizuya.
If you've already decided, I can't do anything...
...but I wouldn't have saved you if I'd known.
But still, it isn't easy for me to raise 200 pieces
of gold.
You've done enough for me.
No, I haven't!
I do business in
Osaka and Sakai, so I'll ask around.
Don't become a courtesan yet.
Excuse me!
A young samurai wants to see you.
A samurai?
Yes, a traveller. What will you do?
I don't know.
He doesn't think you'd remember his name.
He said he met you in Edo.
Omatsu, who is it?
I don't know.
Don't worry. Ask him in.
I must be going.
You stay, too. Can't you, Uncle?
You met in Edo...
But you don't remember him?
No, I'm afraid I don't remember.
Excuse me. One rainy day, I...
I remember. You  were at the Shimada School
in Okachi-machi. Your name's Utsugi.
Please come in won't you?
It's O.K. He's like my real father.
Please come in.
Please don't hold back. Please.
Omatsu, you two met in Edo?
We met only the one time.
Just the once.
I had to come to Kyoto on business.
I was surprised seeing you so unexpectedly.
You have business in Kyoto?
Yes, I'm here to see someone.
Shall I leave?
- Stay, Uncle.
- I can't stay long.
Utsugi, you said you came to see someone.
Are you staying here long?
I do not know yet.
You're not here to see, but to
search for someone, then?
Well, yes.
That's very hard.
Have you any idea...?
Yes, but it’s not that simple.
Excuse me.
Is it a samurai or... ?
Its rather complicated.
There's a party at Tsuchiya tonight.
Shinsen Group men?
Yes, the Mibu rowdies.
Omatsu!
- You know the Shinsen Group?
- Yes.
Assistant Leader Kondo favours
Courtesan Miyuki.
Has the man you're looking for have
anything to do the Shinsen Group?
Utsugi, If there is anything I can do for you...
...please do not hesitate at all to ask.
She's saying she will do anything for you.
Don't hold back from friends.
I'm certain that Ryutaro Yoshida is part of the Shinsen Group.
But he's not in Mibu.
Yoshida...Ryutaro...
His real name's Ryunosuke Tsukue.
He's from Sawai.
 From Sawai? Ryunosuke Tsukue?
Mibu men! The Shinsen Group!
We've come from Mibu!
The more you tell me,
the more a villain he seems.
A man from Hell.
The world's full of villains.
But he beats them all.
Please don't worry.
She's gentle but bright.
She'll ask without arousing suspicion.
- A message from Omatsu?
- That's right.
I see. Thank you.
- Would you like some tea?
- I'm in a hurry.
The message?
A guest named Yoshida is at the party.
I see. Thank you.
When does the party end?
Well, it's just begun.
It'll end about ten I'd think.
- Ten o' clock?
- Yes
Thank you.
Thanks!
What now? He'll be there.
I'll kill him tonight.
Tonight?
I must take advantage of this opportunity.
I'll follow him to a lonely spot, and attack him.
Well, I don't advise it...
What?
He is no ordinary man.
He'd notice if you followed him.
Attack when he comes out!
Yoshida, show me your Silent Form soon!
The Kyoto governor was no help.
We'll have to change tactics.
We'll raise a ruckus and become famous.
Girl! You there. Come over here.
I see you here sometimes.
What's your name?
I'm Matsu.
- How old are you?
- Guess.
Between 18 and 20?
Just about right.
- Where do you live?
- To the west.
- Where in the west?
- A pilgrims' amulet-office.
What? An amulet-office?
You!
- You're working at Kizuya?
- Yes.
To become a courtesan?
I'll help you out then.
I, Serizawa, Shinsen Group Leader,
will make you a woman.
You understand?
You may go.
I must talk to Yoshida a while.
I'm leaving. Take over.
Leader!
It's about Yoshida.
He still lives on the outside and not at Mibu.
The others don't like it.
In a way,
He's a member, and yet also not a member.
He's not the type to conform.
Leave him to me!
I want to talk to you in another room.
You see, I do not know his face.
I know him.
Before your important work...
...there's something I must say.
It's about Omatsu.
The poor girl has no parents.
She had a grandfather,
but the poor man was killed.
What?
I'll explain everything fully later.
It may sound funny for me to say it...
...but she's really a very nice girl.
When you succeed, will you take Omatsu?
That is to say, will you marry her?
It's too soon.
I've important work...
I know you'll win.
Shichibei's behind you.
Don't look quite so stern.
I travel about a lot, peddling expensive
merchandise.
If I cross paths with thieves or bandits...
...that's what this weapon is for.
If things turn bad, it'll prove useful.
No, that's cowardly.
I'll fight fairly.
Please don't worry.
There's little chance I'll need it.
You, Omatsu, and I are avenging
your brother. We can't lose.
Kill Kondo?
As I said, that former farmer
and I differ in everything.
It makes it hard to lead the group.
If Kondo's gone, Hijikata will follow me.
As soon as possible...
No, the sooner the better.
Doing it tonight?
After this party...
No...
He'll leave early and go to Karasumaru...
...to go and see his mistress Oume.
We don’t want to attract attention.
So we three will go at a suitable time.
No. One more, Heisuke Todo.
We four will be enough.
Yoshida, the nuisance?
If you succeed, there will
be a generous reward.
First, I'll give you Hyoma Utsugi's head.
Hyoma?
The brother of Bunnojo, the man you
killed at Mt. Mitake.
He's been checking Mibu
about your whereabouts.
Our men will kill him.
Reward Number two is Kondo's woman.
I'll see that you get her.
She's very beautiful.
Alone in Kyoto, You're lonely...
Omatsu is it? You heard us?
No, I felt sick, so I was resting here.
I must return to the party!
No, you won't!
Serizawa, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
She was eavesdropping!
I'll question her!
Question her? No, just kill her.
She's not worth the trouble.
I'll keep her. You go back to the men.
I agree to what you said.
I see. Then...
Woman.
Who told you to come here?
No one did.
The party's so noisy.
I came here to be quiet.
Pease forgive me!
I didn't hear anything that you said!
Shout or run and I'm afraid I must kill you.
Stay as you are here until I leave.
What is it?
Behind you.
Behind me?
A woman. A woman's figure!
A woman's figure...?
I felt something, too, and looked back...
...but I didn't see anything at all.
But I'm sure I saw her.
- It's a ghost!
- A ghost?
Long ago, a courtesan named Kokonoe...
I don't know the reason.
Powdered and dressed in her best.
She stabbed herself with a dagger here.
This room hasn't been used since.
Sounds quite likely, but there are no ghosts.
I'm more afraid of living people.
See it again?
Yes.
I didn't see anything.
But I distinctly heard sounds.
A sound?
Mountain winds...
They blow up from the valleys.
Shaking the green young leaves.
Far beyond are mountain ranges...
...that fade...
...far away into the clouds.
I feel I saw just such a scene once.
At Dai-bosatsu Pass, I think.
Dai-bosatsu Pass?
Do you know that pass, samurai?
Very well.
But why do you know it?
I passed there once.
A difficult place, 15 miles up and down.
Very strange.
Why would a Kyoto girl go to a mountain pass?
With my grandfather.
As a pilgrim two years ago in May.
Please kill me here!
Fool!!
The sword is the soul!
Study the soul first.
An evil mind, an evil sword!
Merciful Buddha!
Fool!!
Serizawa!
I will kill Kondo as I promised!
Serizawa!
Serizawa! Where's Kondo?
Serizawa!
Kill him!
Finish him off!
THE END
