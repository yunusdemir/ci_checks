<i>Strangers and Brothers</i>
Oh, thank you so much.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
I'm so sorry. I know.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Let's go over there.
Such a shame.
Oh, sorry.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
There's all these
weird people.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
They're not weird, Zoe,
they're just old.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
And why is there
so much food?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Mom says people eat a lot
when somebody dies.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
It's like a reflex.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
I feel nauseous myself.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
The veal chop--
every Thursday.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Phil made them just for us.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Off the menu.
Have you cried?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
A little--
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
like, these little heaves.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
But you're sad.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
I'm sad.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
I just don't know how much.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Hi, girls.
Hi.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
We're gonna miss him so much.
Are you okay, Mom?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Well... okay enough for now.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
My God.
Look at this.
Where did all this food
come from?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Phil was a Civil War buff.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
We'll miss that guy.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
I know.
How's Grandma?
Oh, she hasn't said much.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
She sits, people go to her...
she nods sometimes.
I've got to go talk to her.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Mom, can we go upstairs?
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Sure.
Oh, thank you.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Yeah.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
Hi.
The man was a king.
Oh, thank you.
A prince
of the restaurant world.
That's very kind.
I supplied seafood,
and your father knew fish.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
"My girls were my flowers",
he always said.
Oh, that's so nice.
Thank you for telling me.
Hi, Mom.
We want to talk to you.
In the kitchen... just us.
So, they came for Daddy
at the hospital, Mom...
To take him
to the funeral parlor.
And I'm gonna go by there and
make sure everything's okay.
Do you want to come?
Look at me.
Look at what, Mom?
I'm one of those women now
in an empty chair.
Okay.
Well, we still have decisions
to make about the funeral.
I should start
calling people.
Lily can do it.
She knows who to call.
Mom, we can both do it.
I need to go see Aaron.
He needs to be prepared
for this.
What's to prepare?
Daddy was
his father, too, Mom.
Okay, you know what I think?
I think we should have people speak,
like the Tannenbaums.
Oh, jeez,
not the Tannenbaums.
Uncle Manny, then,
and the Farbers?
And the girls, too,
if they want... and music.
Mom, we should have music.
He loved music so much.
What do you want to have--
songs from "Brigadoon"?
I don't want that.
I want this to be dignified.
For once in my life,
that's what I want.
I think what we were saying
is dignified.
Well, then you girls decide.
Okay, I--I'll try
to reach Rabbi Rosen.
He's retired.
They can retire?
He left his wife
and bought a houseboat.
I've got to go
take care of my guests.
You're in mourning, Mom.
You're not a hostess.
You decide.
You girls decide.
I think I'm gonna
bang my head until it bleeds.
I have never seen her
like this. It scares me.
I have to go to Aaron.
Do you want me
to go with you?
No, I--I think
it would overwhelm him.
Judy!
We have to get a rabbi.
What are you looking
at me for?
Well, what about that guy Bruce,
that rabbi you dated?
Two years ago.
It was sex.
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, thank God.
I don't know where
he is. Hello.
Hi, hi, hi.
I'm so sorry
about your father.
Thank you.
Well, you said there were
gonna be a lot of people...
and--and...
You okay?
- Oh, I'm trying to be.
- Yeah?
Mom's not doing very well,
but that's to be expected.
Hey, I happen to know
a rabbi.
You? Are you even
remotely Jewish?
No, he's this nice guy
who lives in my building.
He has a black lab.
I could call him and--
Mom, they're coming
upstairs, too.
Somebody used our bathroom
without asking.
Oh, it's all very strange,
isn't it?
Thank you. Come here.
Is it okay
if I haven't cried yet?
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh, yes, honey.
There are a lot of ways
to be sad.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Help yourself.
The veal chop.
Every Thursday--
off the menu.
Oh, okay, all right.
Hi. How you doing?
I'm fine.
I'm--I'm just...
I'm sorry about, uh...
How are you?
- Here, here. Put this here.
- Oh, thank you.
- I'll just find a place.
- Put it anywhere.
Okay. Excuse me.
How you doing?
Okay. How are you?
Oh, you know. I'm all right.
I'm all right.
I loved that guy.
I mean, you know I feel like
he was my own father, right?
Well, he loved you.
Hi, Jake.
Hey. Marvin, hey.
The veal chop--
nothing is gonna change.
Okay?
Where are the kids?
They're in the living room.
You okay?
Yes. Yes.
- Let me take those. Hang on. Hang on.
- Ah, good.
Here, put them over here.
Ah, yes.
I'm gonna go.
Please don't.
Please don't.
No, you're the head
of the family...
and you have things to do.
Go.
Call me.
I will.
Mom, what are you doing?
Mom?
We have to choose.
What do we have to choose?
What he's gonna be buried in. He's not
gonna be buried in a hospital gown.
Now, we have all these
lovely shirts like this one.
We can handle this, Mom.
I'm not taking these
back to Florida.
Jake is a foot taller than Daddy,
and your young man is tall, too.
Aaron is Daddy's size.
Do you want to talk
about Aaron now?
We have to talk
about Aaron now.
He's very sick.
He has his ups
and downs, Mom.
I'm his mother.
You think I don't know that?
I know you do.
I'm sorry.
I--I can't even imagine what
you're going through right now.
No, my dear, you can't. I don't think
Aaron would survive a funeral.
Well, he's survived 20 years
in the mental-health system.
Do what you need to do.
You've always known best.
I have to go to Aaron.
Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?
Thanks.
No, I'll be all right.
Lily.
Oh, God. Manny.
Oh. How are you?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
You know,
the night you were born...
your father called me up,
he said, "It's a girl.
What if she grows up
to look like Aunt Esther?"
And then he said,
"I'll still love her...
because I never knew
there was love like this."
Thank you
for telling me that.
Oh, Lord,
I've lost track of time.
I need to go downstairs.
Lily, I need to talk to you.
As Daddy's friend
or his lawyer?
Both. There are some things
that you need to think about.
Think about or worry about?
Well, think a lot,
worry a little bit...
like your father used to say.
You know, we spoke to each other
twice a week for 46 years.
I'm all up-to-date with you.
I know about Jake.
Your father liked him,
but he didn't trust him...
and I got to tell you
what he wanted you to do.
I'm afraid to hear this.
Now...
Your mother still owns
40% of the restaurant.
You and Jake own 60...
which means that you personally
control half of that : 30.
Right.
Now, if you're ever unhappy...
with the way Jake
is running the business...
you and your mother
can vote to fire him.
Fire him?
Well, that's what your father
was prepared to do...
if the divorce
took a difficult turn.
Fire Jake?
Well, if that's the only way...
to protect the family's
inheritance, yeah.
I don't know what he'd do
without the restaurant.
Well, that's something that
he should have been thinking about...
a long time ago,
don't you think?
<i>We had a dream... a fantasy,</i>
<i>you might call it--</i>
<i>that one night we'd</i>
<i>break into the Smithsonian...</i>
<i>and steal</i>
<i>the Spirit of St. Louis...</i>
<i>and fly halfway to Paris</i>
<i>and jump.</i>
<i>It would be hard for the girls...</i>
<i>we knew that--</i>
<i>but we'd die together.</i>
We're here, Mom, okay?
You have to know that.
Zoe, is that the dress
you're gonna wear?
I think so. Mommy?
This is her best dress, Mom.
Well, what about
that blue velvet one?
No, this one's just fine.
But Grandpa loved that dress.
He always said she looked like
a little bluebird in it.
Mom, she's just fine
as she is, all right?
She's just fine.
Should we all go in one car?
Oh, thanks, Jake. Yes.
Okay, let me get your coat.
Is there something wrong
with me, Mom?
No, sweetheart,
absolutely not.
You look just fine.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You must be Lily.
Yes, I am.
Hi,
I'm Rabbi Ben Josephson.
I got Rick's message
late last night.
I'm so sorry about your dad.
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
This is my mother.
Mrs. Brooks.
I'm here as you need me,
but we will need to talk...
about what you want me to do
and how I can help you.
Maybe we can talk after
you go into the chapel.
All right.
<i>Zoe came early,</i>
<i>and I couldn't find Jake...</i>
<i>so Daddy came with me</i>
<i>to the hospital...</i>
<i>and he stayed</i>
<i>even after Jake got there.</i>
Dad.
<i>Phil was the first</i>
<i>grownup I knew...</i>
<i>that didn't look a little worried</i>
<i>when I walked into the room.</i>
<i>He liked me.</i>
Mommy?
Yes, sweetie?
I don't feel so good.
Daddy.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I think
I'm going to throw up.
Okay. I'll take her.
You're not gonna throw up,
sweetie.
Hi, Aaron.
I'm really lucky
to have my sisters.
Are you? That makes us feel
really good to hear--
- You know Roger?
- From your house?
Roger has six sisters--
two are twins.
But they don't know him--hygiene issues.
He stinks. They have a point, Judy.
But I'm lucky.
You and Lily make me lucky.
We're a team, which is what
Dad says, and Shelley, too.
Shelley's a great case manager, Judy.
She's one of the all-time greats.
She's the Babe Ruth
of case managers.
I'm sure she'd love to hear you
say that, Aaron. I know I would.
You know, Roger always talks about Jesus,
and I tried to tell him about Dad today...
but forget it--his consuming
passion is Jesus, period...
- which can, frankly, get fairly boring, Judy.
- I'm sure it can.
I tried to tell him I was nervous today,
but the subject just plain wouldn't stick.
Well, we're here,
if that helps.
Lily's here.
Aaron's a little bit
nervous today.
A little nervous.
That's okay,
because I am, too.
I feel better seeing you.
Thank you for coming here.
Daddy would be so happy.
<i>God, they were beautiful.</i>
<i>Really sort of one...</i>
<i>this single beautiful</i>
<i>brother-sister.</i>
Mom.
Aw, come on.
Hello, Aaron.
How is he?
We're a team.
Phil Brooks.
Yeah.
Let me tell you
about Phil Brooks.
He would be very upset if he saw
anybody looking morose here today.
Like he used to say,
"When you're down in the
dumps, don't order the fish."
I don't know
what he meant, either.
I want you
to listen to this.
This is Phil's favorite song, played
at his wedding to the beautiful Barbara.
"I Can't Get Started"--
Bunny Berigan.
So, speaking as his chief
hostess for 30 years...
Phil Brooks cannot be dead.
He's just late for his reservation.
He always called me "cookle"
or "cookie" or "muffin"...
or "french fry"
or "pumpkin pie"...
"blueberry,"
"dumpling"...
"Two priests and a rabbi
were walking on a golf course"...
or, like, "the pope is taking
a vacation in Jamaica."
He was so funny, and, um...
the thing was is that...
when you were with him,
you were funny, too.
Mom.
I'm so used to hiding
from your father.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Guess I can smoke
all I want to now.
I can stay up all night
and drink gin if I want to.
Oh, it hasn't sunk in.
It just hasn't sunk in.
Mom, please don't stand out here
in the cold by yourself, okay?
Judy's about to take Aaron home.
Come inside and say goodbye.
Let's go.
Aaron wants to say good night.
Oh. All right.
That's nice.
He'll be back
in the morning, though.
Dad is with us.
Judy... are you sure
he understands all this?
Maybe you could explain it--
how you feel.
- He'll understand that.
- How I feel? What does that matter?
Oh, Mom,
try to talk to him. Try.
Aaron...
Aaron, I hope
that you have a good night...
and that you sleep.
You know, we all
need sleep, because...
Don't stop.
It's all right.
Aaron, I know this is
hard for us without Dad.
It's hard for you--
I knew it.
It's okay.
I'm feeling
definitely nervous today.
It's okay. We all are.
It's all right.
- Let's go home now.
- We're a team.
Good night, Aaron.
Good night.
Well, uh,
do you want to wait?
No, no,
I heard her drive up.
All right.
Well, you should know that the last time
anybody actually read a will...
was on page 11
of "David Copperfield".
Hi. He's okay.
Now, there are
no surprises here...
no millions left
to a pussycat...
but certain things about
the restaurant were decided.
Now, Barbara and Phil
already generously gave...
60% of the restaurant
to Lily and Jake.
Sold.
Oh, forgive me. Sold...
with payments made over many years
to make it easier for them.
And less of a tax burden
for him.
Absolutely.
Phil was a practical man.
This arrangement
served everybody.
Now, uh, last week
Phil instructed me...
that he wanted his heirs
to retain individual rights...
on the disposition
of the estate as a whole.
I--I don't understand
what that means.
Well, your father understood
that people might disagree...
on the best course of
action for the restaurant...
and, uh, he just wanted his children
to have some say in their future.
I'm sorry.
I still don't understand.
You know, I put a lot of years
in this restaurant, Manny.
- I can't believe what you're saying.
- It's not me, Jake. It was Phil.
What's Phil?
What are you saying?
He's saying I can be fired.
He's saying that even though I'm a partner,
the other partners can vote me out.
Manny, Phil would not
have taken this position.
- He wouldn't have.
- I'm sorry, Jake. It's in writing.
Okay, then, you know what?
Uh, look, Jake, Phil accepted,
with a lot of sadness...
that things could never go back
to the way they were.
He just wanted
his children to have...
All right, so I'm out
of the family, then, right?
After - after 17 years,
I'm--
- Well, no--
- No, look--
This is just possibilities.
Jake--
look, hey, no.
You just--guys, just...
decide what
you're gonna do, okay?
Really. I'm serious.
I--I don't even care anymore.
Okay, guys, just...
Decide.
I'd forgotten how substantial
the Chicago papers are.
Compared to...
Florida.
What's "shiva" mean?
Judy, why don't you
explain it to her?
Why me?
- I'm not Jewish. I never was.
- Mother.
I offered to convert, but your Daddy
always said he liked me as a shiksa.
Uh, Zoe,
what, uh, "shiva" is...
is this ritual at your house...
in which people who know
the dead person--
Person who passed away.
They come for seven days
and sit with you and talk...
and mark the passing away
of the dead person.
And eat you
out of house and home.
For seven days?
Don't worry. It's not gonna be
seven days. This is it.
So, that's shiva.
Mom... I've been thinking.
I don't think you should feel like
you have to rush back to Florida.
You can stay here for as
long as you need to.
Tht's very sweet of you, dear,
but I have to make some plan.
As we heard your daddy say
a million times--
You know what, Mom? Don't make a plan.
You could just wing it.
This is an important
transition in your life.
There's gonna be all kind of
feelings that are gonna come up.
Judith, will you stop talking
to me about feelings?
Mom, she's right.
You haven't been alone in--
what? What is it?
43 years,
and I'm proud of that.
What I meant was you did live
here in Chicago your whole life
until very, very recently.
Mom?
WoBarbara?
Oh, jeez.
It's the Tannenbaums.
A bit early,
don't you think?
This has really got to be
the end of the shiva business.
Ceil? Marvin?
I'm coming.
Hello, dear.
I'm sorry
I asked about shiva.
Oh, girls!
We have to get dressed.
Showtime.
Well, it's been
a hell of a goodbye.
It's what
he would've wanted.
He would've loved
the singing.
Honey,
where are the cookies?
Phil was a musical man--
musical.
Mondays were opera nights,
fat slobs going from table to table.
I said, "Phil,
it's annoying."
He said, "Celeste,
music is also food."
That song
always made him cry.
Would you excuse me
for a second?
Uh, me too.
They're lovely girls.
I know.
Oh! Uncle Aaron.
I mean, I'm sorry.
- For what?
- That sound.
I thought
there was no one here.
Know what I think?
All these old, boring people
are just here for the food.
Have you had any lunch?
Not that you're...
old and boring.
Lunch sounds like a plan.
Okay. Um...
anything in particular?
Just no stew. We've been
on a stew run where I live.
I can help make it, but I'm
getting pretty sick of it...
but stew would be fine.
Then... we won't have stew.
Okay.
It's Grace, Uncle Aaron.
I mean, you should
feel free to call me Grace.
I hope that wasn't rude--
about my name, I mean.
It's just I sensed
you might be worried...
about just saying it,
you know?
And, uh, it's just a name.
I like yours.
There's this guy
in my school named Aaron.
Do you like him?
He's okay.
He's a musician--
trombone.
Didn't you used to play
an instrument?
The trumpet.
Really? It would be cool
to hear you play.
The problem is...
my fingers aren't necessarily
my own anymore.
Well, that must be hard
for you to feel that.
It's been a long time.
Sometimes
I feel like that--
like all my extremities
are, in this weird way...
sort of... borrowed.
Do you want me to do it?
I can. Thank you.
Have some.
I like the dark meat.
I like the white meat.
Well, then, here.
Well, okay.
I had to get away.
I had to get away.
How long have you
been out here?
I'm not sure.
All day, off and on.
Yeah.
Here.
I know.
Can you believe Mom said that
about shiksas in front of the girls?
- I hate Mom.
- You do not.
Oh, who the hell knows?
Did you really mean that,
about her staying a while?
Oh, just fell out
of my mouth...
like a tooth
I didn't know was loose.
I should get back.
I don't think shiva counts if
you spend it sitting in a car.
For your fingers.
Thank you.
Uncle Aaron...
Do you remember?
I mean, the time
when you weren't sick?
Lots. Like about Lily.
She used to worry a lot.
She used to worry whether she could be
pretty and good, which just made her prettier.
And specific beaches.
- Do you like the beach?
- Who wouldn't?
I'm sorry.
That's dumb of me.
You know, what I'd like to
remember someday... is a job.
Oh, my mom just got one.
But she's not
on medication.
I'll say.
So... tell me...
what kind of job?
Useful,
which I've never been.
I just keep
staying unnecessary.
And I need a plan
because Dad would say--
a little too often
for my personal taste--
he'd say, "Aaron,
your plan is your road."
So you want a plan
and to be useful.
Those are wonderful things
to want, Aaron.
And when my dad was my daddy
and I played the trumpet...
the song was
"I Can't Get Started".
Like yesterday.
It was beautiful.
It's wonderful to talk
to you, Uncle Aaron.
How did you know this is
exactly what I wanted?
Oh, I'm a restaurant man,
Mom.
I've been thinking
about Florida.
Even down there,
Phil thought nothing...
of dragging home
about 1 0 people every night.
People just found Phil.
Yeah, but now
it's gonna be--
Oh, I'm sorry. It--
No, go ahead, dear.
Tell me.
Well, it--
I'm just different.
I--I think about my place
and, you know...
the nights
the girls aren't there.
It--I--I know.
I mean,
it doesn't compare.
Yes, it does.
The thing is, you just never
know what's gonna happen.
See, the thing is, I do know
what's gonna happen...
I mean, at least
in terms of the restaurant.
Listen. Listen, I--I need you
to hear this from me.
We're there.
You know, thanks to Phil and--
and what he taught me...
it's working, and it's gonna work.
I mean, can you see that?
Yes, I can see it.
I mean, I'd like to b--
We're open again,
and we're making money.
- You mean, like it was before?
- No, it's even better...
and I'm gonna keep it
going and growing...
you know,
for Phil, for you...
for the girls,
for all of us.
Now, just--just let me
do that, Mom, okay?
I mean, that's--
that's all I ask.
Oh, Jake.
Here's what I want.
Tell me.
For it to be 1967...
for me to be in a booth
at Daddy's restaurant...
with Aaron,
his Cub hat on...
while they spell out
my name in french fries.
Since you asked.
So, Jake built this?
Yeah.
It's well-built.
I'm impressed.
Aunt Judy brought these.
They're so cool.
Oh, look--
Grandpa in the Army.
Here he is with a baby. That must
be you, 'cause here's Mom.
You were so cute.
Is that you in camp?
Did you go to camp?
- Yes.
- Was it a trumpet thing?
Guess what? I'm doing
a camp in the summer.
- Did you go to, um, Wisconsin or...
- Aaron?
Hi. I want you
to meet Rick Sammler.
This is my brother Aaron.
Hi, Aaron.
Hello, Rick.
Uncle Aaron,
you really should shave.
Yes.
Oh, my God--
Jeanne Ford.
You were so in love with her, Aaron.
Remember her?
Zoe, you were such
a chunky baby.
I was not.
At least I wasn't fat.
Yeah, but now
you're all bony.
Wait a minute, girls.
- I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
- Grace!
Aaron, listen,
we're gonna step outside...
Stop it! You don't
know what you're doing!
You're not helping!
Get away!
Please go away.
Fine.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Yeah, it's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's all right.
You don't smoke, do you?
Not for about 15 years.
Nobody smokes anymore.
Try to even bum
a cigarette these days...
and people think
you're a criminal.
He was a big, loud, aggressive schmuck...
Phil was.
But I liked him.
I built this, you know.
We talked about how this
would be very stressful...
and I think, under the circumstances,
Aaron is doing wonderfully.
He seems to be. In fact, my God,
I'm amazed we didn't all fall apart.
But he hasn't either.
That's what you have to see.
He has a lot going
for him.
He has all of us at the home,
he has both of you...
and your father,
who never gave up on him.
A lot of parents do.
You know, every Thursday, your dad
would bring him to the restaurant.
They'd sit in the front booth.
Remember, Aaron?
And what would your dad say?
"I want you
to meet my son Aaron."
Oh. I never knew that.
Jake had Thursday nights
off.
Hey. He's okay.
Oh, good.
He's okay,
not that anybody asked.
What?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Did you ask me why
I don't treat Aaron right?
Mom, he's your son.
Yes, he's my son.
And you don't know anything
about that, my dear.
You don't know anything about the years
of my life that live in that boy.
Okay, Mom, we don't
have to do this now.
You don't know anything about me--
either one of you.
Mom...
Mom, we want to know.
You're just like
your father.
The thousands of times
that I've gone into a room...
and I've seen
the three of you laughing.
You see me, and you stop.
No, that's not true.
Yes, you do!
You shut me out!
Mom, we love you.
You know that.
Mom, we just--you always had this
right way of doing everything.
We never knew what it was.
We were just
protecting ourselves.
I never punished you.
I never pushed you away.
I never gave you any cause to think
that you had to protect yourself from me.
Oh, don't you understand...
that there was a human being
standing there with feelings?
Mom, we're here now.
Mom!
We're here now.
We see you now.
Aaron was my son...
and your father
was my husband.
And they're both gone.
And I--I'm a widow,
and I'm terrified.
Mom, you don't have to be
terrified.
You have us.
You have your family.
Yes, Mom.
I'm supposed to count
on you now suddenly?
I need help, and all I can say is,
"Thank God for Jake."
What do you mean?
I mean Jake talked to me,
and I can count on him.
He's going to work seven days
a week at that restaurant--
seven days a week.
Oh, my God.
Mom, he should not be talking
to you like that. Can you see that?
I can see that he cares about me
and that he wants to help me...
in a way that your father
would understand.
But he didn't understand,
and neither do you...
this one
really important thing...
that you got to
get straight now, Mom--
I am divorcing Jake.
He is not my husband.
He is out of my life.
Where does that
leave me, Lily?
Where does that leave me?
Lord.
Did you notice her skin?
It's like you can...
look through it suddenly...
like she's made
out of glass.
You know,
she was right last night.
I don't know.
We don't know her.
We only know what's
been useful to us...
and now that Daddy's gone...
We might have to?
Don't look at me.
You're the oldest.
I was thinking maybe
she could move in with you.
Well, I could use a roommate.
We could double-date.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Here.
Oh, God, there it is.
- I thought I had lost that. Where is it?
- Where is it?
Oh, hang on, hang on.
I'm coming.
Hello?
Hey, I took a chance.
Hey. It's Rick.
I'm in the car with Judy.
Are you going somewhere?
Well, we're not
physically moving, no...
if that's what you mean.
I'll be inside.
I'll be in in a minute.
I can call you back,
or you could call me.
There's just this... thing
I wanted to tell you.
No, no,
I'm so happy it's you.
Lily, I may be wrong
to tell you this...
but... when I was leaving,
I saw Jake outside...
and I talked to him.
What'd you talk about?
It wasn't what he said--
it's that I don't think...
I've ever seen anybody
look so sad.
And it's like for the first time,
he became real to me...
you know, what he's--
what he's lost.
Lil?
I'm here.
Mom?
What are you doing?
Well, I called the airport,
and I changed my ticket.
I'm going back to Florida
tomorrow morning.
Why?
Your father made
9,000 friends down there...
and I have to do something.
I don't want it to be just thrown together--
cold cuts from a delicatessen.
I left a sweater here
in the closet.
Mom, you know,
I meant what I said.
I told you you could stay here
for as long as you needed or wanted.
Me?
I'm a pain.
Before you know it, I'd be
wearing your robe and slippers.
You'd be sorry you asked.
I mean it, Mom.
I know that, darling, but don't
you think I need to go home?
We are your home.
Oh, Lily, you have a life
of your own to lead.
You have me and Judy
and Aaron and the girls.
Such sweet little girls,
too.
Yeah, they are, and they're stronger
all the time. I see that.
I raised really strong
daughters, Mom.
I think I learned it
from you.
Well, I could have done
so much better.
I wanted to do
so much better, Lily.
Mom, you did great.
Oh, no, your daddy--
No, you.
Dad wasn't there.
He was out
making 9,000 friends.
And I loved him dearly,
Mom, but it was you.
I mean, look at all that's happened
in my life in the last year...
and here I am.
Maybe I'm better off
than I was.
I don't know yet,
but I do know that I found...
an inner strength that
I didn't even know existed...
and I also think that--that you are
trusting Jake because he's a man.
And I know he has
wonderful qualities--
God knows I know that--
but...
Jake really cares
about me, Lily.
Mom,
he cares about himself.
I care about you.
You have to trust me, Mom.
Would you help me
with this, please?
It's kind of tricky.
It--it's a lot fuller
than it looks.
There you go.
Lily.
Hi, Jake.
Hi. Uh...
You hungry? I can, you know, make you
a burger or something like that.
We're closed
in memory of your dad.
I'm not hungry, thanks.
So, that's it?
No more shiva sitters?
Goodbye, Tannenbaums?
Yeah, Mom's leaving
tomorrow for Florida.
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?
Jake, I talked to Mom.
Yeah.
Of course you did.
And you should know
that what's happened is...
she's given me her proxy.
So I can fire you.
I can fire you anytime.
But I'm not doing it now.
What does that mean?
It means that I want you
to make it work.
I want you to keep
your promise...
and make it work
for you and all of us.
And another thing is I want Aaron
to be able to come here...
like he did with my dad.
I want the girls and Judy and
Aaron and I to come here...
because
it's our family's place.
So...
And this was
my father's...
and I want you
to have it.
Wow, that's familiar.
Always set your watch
15 minutes slow...
so when people are late
for their reservations...
they're really on time,
and, uh...
you're glad to see them.
So, what else?
Nothing else.
I wish you could
stay longer.
I do, too, honey.
I'm gonna need a big hug to
help me hold up the plane.
Grandpa always said that.
Well, he was
a smart guy, wasn't he?
Hi.
Hi.
He's ready, Mom.
How do I look?
You look beautiful.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
That should be trimmed
in the spring.
Aaron?
I'm going back
to Florida now.
Okay.
I have things to do
there.
Okay.
I'm going to have a memorial
for your daddy.
I want to come.
Uh... did I leave
my tickets upstairs?
No, Mom,
I think you have them.
- I do?
- Yeah.
I want to come.
I'm sure you do...
for your daddy.
We'll see. We'll see.
Um, so...
I think we should go now
so I don't miss my plane.
Mommy.
I know, darling.
You want to come
for your daddy.
I want to come for you.
Oh... oh, Aaron...
I...
My...
Oh, Aaron, I--
You know, Roger,
who lives in my building...
he's been offered
the vice-presidential spot...
but I keep forgetting
for which party.
Independent Party,
I believe it is.
Democratic Party--
yes, it is.
It's the Democratic Party.
Really?
Well, it hardly matters.
It's a... lousy job anyway.
Yeah.
Will you try to take
good care of yourself?
Yes.
Oh, look, I have
these tickets after all.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I'm ready if you are.
I'm ready.
It's time to go.
Bye.
