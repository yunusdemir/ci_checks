I love Christmas!

This is exciting.
What's it gonna say?
Wow, Norman.
Susan, did you see that?
You know who saw that?
Jesus saw that!
And his dad. He saw that.
All right folks, looks like...
Norman's hitting the trail,
so we'll just get this

Yes, sir!
We're gonna share the spirit.
We're gonna deck some halls!
I'm gonna get Susan

Christmas, usually a time of joy
and celebration, but for
Saint Joseph's Academy,
a time of mourning.
Exactly one year ago
last Christmas Eve
this school was the scene of an
unimaginable crime when two
of its students,
Connor and Jenna,
seen here, were found
murdered in cold blood.
With the killer still at large,
the atmosphere here
in Bailey Downs
is truly grim this
holiday season.

To be honest, Aunt Etta,
I know you
and mom had
difficulties and I just
thought we could
get it out there
and deal with it.
Dear, maybe now's
not a good time.
It's Christmas, what
could be a better time?
Christmas is all
about forgiveness
and family and tradition.
If you just believe, if you let
that spirit in, it fills you.
Don't touch that!
It's very old.
Is there some place more private
you and I could talk, I wanna
show you something I think
you might be interested in.
Come.

This is Krampus, right?
What's a Krampus?
He's like an anti-Santa Claus,
a demon who punishes
the naughty.
He whips them, chains them up,
throws them in a
sack, stuff like that.
When Krampus knocked,
the demon hunts the wicked
from sunset to sunrise.
That's fun.
He comes for little boys who
touch things they shouldn't.
