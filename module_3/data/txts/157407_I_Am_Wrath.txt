We're following a series of
shootings in Columbus.
The daytime gun battle on a busy
street caught on camera.
<i>Get out of the car!</i>
Shocking new video tonight that
you'll only see here.
<i>Put your hands down!</i>
<i>Get off the bike.</i>
<i>Get off the bike.</i>
<i>Put your hands up!</i>
There's a new effort today
to try to stop all the gang
related violence in our city.
Police have made some arrests
after the killing of yet another
teenager on a Columbus street.
Summer police are dealing with
an unsettling spike
in violent crime.
Spokesperson for Governor
Meserve says that
these shootings are not
random acts of violence.
Quote: "What I want to let
everyone at home know
is that these are targeted acts
of criminals..."
I'm sorry.
I'm getting some breaking news.
Word that a protest...
We're hearing that a protest we
were covering
has escalated into violence.
We're gonna go live now to...
The police have identified
three shooting victims
found behind the sheetrock
of an apartment building
that's undergoing a remodel.
Tragically, we can now confirm
that one of the victims
was an undercover police officer
killed in the line of duty.
Hundreds attended the solemn
funeral procession
of slain officer Hernandez
earlier today.
In his eulogy,
Governor Meserve continues to
stress that crime is down.
In fact, quote:
"hype and hysteria are up."
This summer has seen a 24%
increase in shootings
over the last year.
We are just receiving some
alarming news right now.
A shootout is actually erupting.
That's happening...
Where's this happening?
Right now, we're receiving word
of a police chase
that's going on on
Interstate 75.
He actually might spin out here.
There are officers, you guys,
right behind him.
All right, it looks like we're
coming to a stop out here.
The guy is getting out
of the vehicle.
The guy is getting out of the
vehicle. He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
He just got into a van.
This could end very badly out
here. He's gesturing.
Oh, this is not good.
This is now a hostage situation.
The person trying to get out...
Oh no, he's being dragged.
A guy is being dragged.
This has now turned into
a hostage situation.
Violent crime has increased 18%
this year
with a significant spike
in shootings.
Over 300 shootings this year
with close to 50
gun related deaths.
Local police say that an
abundance of illegal guns
in the hands of gang members
are the cause.
Well, John, the sheriff
has yet to release
an official statement.
But an inside source has told me
that this horrific shooting
is very likely another
gang initiation.
Governor Meserve returned to
Columbus today
for a campaign rally where he
continued to stress
that crime is in fact down
across the state.
I am just being told right now
that the third shooting victim
has been pronounced dead upon
arrival at County Hospital.
Police have released security
cam footage of the suspect.
A warning to our viewers...
These images may be difficult
for some.
In less than four years,
we've cut this state's homicide
rate nearly in half.
Robbery rate, a third.
Vandalism, auto theft,
crime is down.
But don't ask me.
Mom!
Look. It's your new boss.
Have we pushed drugs and gangs
out of our neighborhoods?
Together, we've called out the
corrupt.
And together, we'll keep going
into the future.
<i>What about the Pipeline?</i>
Well as I've always maintained,
the Corner Turn oil line
would be a boon
to this state's economy.
Clean water is a human right.
That's why my office
has commissioned its own
environmental review
<i>to compare
with the E.P.A.'s audit.</i>
Mom.
Mom! Look, you're famous!
They're talking about your
project.
I'm not famous. I'm just
checking the numbers
for the secretary
of somebody famous.
Cuz apparently famous people
cannot do their own math.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Look at you.
What, did you lie out?
A little.
Damn. I should go away
more often. Hi.
I missed you, Stan.
So, how did it work out
with your boss?
Not so good.
Well, what do you mean?
I want to hear about you first.
Tell me everything.
How did it go?
Okay.
I'm just saying it was awesome.
Those headquarters,
it's the real deal.
I loved it.
Oh my god, baby.
Well, so...
So he said I'll call you.
And I said, "what the hell does
that mean, we'll call you?'
And he said, "Stan,
I'll see you soon. Real soon."
So does that mean
you got the job?
I don't know. Maybe.
Oh, that would be so amazing.
I know. California, baby.
Abbie and Mike could come visit.
Bring Jimmy to Disneyland.
I know. It would be so cool.
It'd be awesome.
Where'd you park?
Wait, where did I...
I thought I parked...
It's 3G.
Yeah.
Ah-hah.
There you go.
Ah, shit.
Man.
Oh my God.
How'd that happen?
Should I call Triple A?
No. I'll do it.
You sure?
Yeah.
<i>Excuse me, ma'am?</i>
<i>Excuse me?</i>
I'm late for my flight. I've got
my kid waiting in the lobby.
I just need three more bucks
for my ticket.
Not today.
Come on, man.
She's about to give it to me.
Get in the car.
Not today.
For real?
For real.
Seriously?
Seriously. Just,
just back off. Okay?
Stan!
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Mr. Hill,
I'm Detective Gilmore.
Columbus Metro P.D.
How's that cut?
Huh?
Cut on your forehead.
Forehead bleeds a lot.
It gets in your eyes and...
But you still got a good look
at the suspect?
Yes. I saw him before he hit me.
But there was more than one.
There...
How many?
Well I just, just heard them.
But were like two or three.
Did you get a look at the
vehicle?
No, I just heard that too.
I just kinda...
It sounded like the rumble of a
hemi engine,
you know maybe a 60's muscle car
or something like that.
I used to rebuild engines
since I was a kid.
And I'm a plant manager for
Chrysler. Well, I was.
Now Honda, maybe.
Where's that sketch artist?
I'll get him.
Mr. Hill, this is my partner,
Detective Walker.
He's gonna ask you
a few more questions.
Sir.
I can't even imagine what you
must be going through.
But you know every little detail
is gonna get us closer
to the people that did this.
And it's best to do this when
the memory's fresh.
Sorry.
I make this speech
way too often.
Mr. Hill, what was the state of
your marriage?
Were you getting along?
What the hell kind of question
is that?
It's just a standard one, sir.
Are you married, detective?
Was.
Didn't work out.
Well then you don't know.
You just don't know.
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.
I'm gonna miss you
so much.
I love you.
Dad.
Hi, baby.
You know...
The day you were coming home,
she was driving me nuts.
Oh yeah, why?
She had to get
a whole new outfit.
She wanted...
She wanted tan lines
cuz she thought they were sexy.
People are starting to arrive.
I'm gonna leave.
Dad.
I can't... I can't see people.
But everyone's gonna ask.
I know. But I only came for her.
I love you.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Do you want Mike to drive you home?
Mr. Hill?
No, no, no. I'm good.
Mr. Hill?
Yes?
Are the arrangements
satisfactory?
They're fine.
Then shall we join your friends
to say goodbye to Vivian
together?
She's already gone.
Take this.
I don't pray.
I only went to church
for my wife.
That's why I'm giving it to you.
Governor Meserve,
you've stood by your record
for reducing crime in Ohio.
Do you have any comments about
the murder of Vivian Hill?
Well first,
our thoughts and prayers go out
to the Hill family.
And secondly,
this tragedy in our state
capitol should remind us
that we need to stay vigilant.
Our fight against crime doesn't
end just because we're winning.
<i>My office is in constant contact</i>
with Mayor Roberts
and Police Commissioner Brown.
And we promise swift justice for
Vivian Hill and for her family.
<i>Thank you.</i>
Hello?
Dad. It's me.
I'm just checking in.
<i>You okay?</i>
Hi, honey.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
<i>You sure?</i>
Yeah. Yeah,
hey, you get some rest.
Okay. You too.
<i>Dad, just promise me you won't
blame yourself for all this.</i>
<i>Honey,
you just try to get some sleep.</i>
Good night.
I love you.
I love you too.
<i>Thanks for coming in, Mr. Hill.</i>
<i>So what's happening?</i>
<i>Well, we may have gotten lucky.</i>
They picked him up at a traffic
stop last night,
tweaked out of his mind.
Good ears, Mr. Hill.
What do you mean?
He was driving a '67 Charger.
Really?
A Charger?
You ready?
It's okay.
The detector's broken.
No. I haven't smoked in years.
You wife hound you too?
Send them in!
You said he had a tattoo
on his face. Right, Mr. Hill?
Gentlemen, face right.
Number four, step forward.
No, that's... That's a teardrop.
That's not him.
Take your time.
I will.
Eyes up, guys. Let's see
your faces, both sides.
Face left.
Face front.
Hold.
Two. The second guy.
Number two, up front.
Number two, remove your hat.
That's him.
That's him.
You sure, Mr. Hill? Now you said
he was wearing a hoodie.
You had blood in your eyes.
Did you see his face?
No, I didn't... I didn't
have blood. I wasn't hit yet.
That, that's him. You told us in your
statement it was a tattoo of a bat.
You seemed pretty sure.
This is a homicide case.
We can't go on a guess.
No, I thought it was a bat.
But it's a fly. And that's him.
I'm certain of it.
That's him.
Okay.
Okay what?
Okay, uh...
That's it?
That's it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
What happened?
Why did you let him go?
Keep your voice down.
No, no, no.
You keep your voice down!
Don't make it worse, Mr. Hill.
Worse?! Worse?!
What could be worse than
the man who killed my wife
walks out of here like it's a
joke! Like it's nothing!
Even if we bring him back,
it's not gonna help your case.
Okay. How will I help my case?
Tell me.
Time.
Time?
These types don't live long.
He'll OD.
He'll get himself killed.
Oh Jesus Christ.
You want me to go home and hope
that he dies. Is that it?
Ah, Jesus.
Mr. Hill.
I'd like to hang most of the
shit bags who walk through here.
But I can't.
Neither can you.
Know what?
You're right.
It's not my job.
It's your job. It is.
It's okay.
The kid's on Lemi K's crew.
That whole file's on ice.
Yeah, well
it better stay that way.
Yeah.
Dad?
Dad, I've been trying to call
you. What happened? Was it him?
Yeah, it's him.
I'm sure of it.
So they arrested him?
No, no. They told me
I wasn't a credible witness.
They let that piece of shit
walk?!
The police don't care
about your mother.
It's just another body to them.
That's bullshit.
I know, I know.
Hey. Do you want to
come over tonight?
You could spend the night
with us.
We can talk about it.
No thanks, honey. I'm good.
I just, I just really,
I just need to be alone.
<i>Hi. You've reached the Hills.
We're not in right now.</i>
<i>After the beep, please leave a
message for Stanley or Vivian.</i>
<i>You made a big change for me.
A long time ago.</i>
I heard about Vivian.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
We buried her last week.
You know we never did funerals.
That's not why I'm calling.
All right.
So what do you need?
Just a few names.
Hello?
There's no smoking in the shop.
They're your cigarettes,
asshole.
There's definitely no stealing
in the shop either.
Been a while since you came in.
Yeah, well there's
a lot of things I haven't done
for a while.
Had a grandson.
Good for you.
Buy him a puppy.
That Sao Paulo op.
When was that?
Twenty years ago?
Really haven't thought about it.
Couldn't tell you.
You mad at me?
You're mad at me.
Do I look like a guy who's hung
out to dry and is mad?
No, I don't think so.
Stanley. Trust.
I do.
No. You really don't.
You still have issues.
If you had just trusted me
this much...
We'd still be out in the field.
You know that's not why I left.
I know. I know.
Vivian. A woman like that
was worth walking away for.
You hit the lottery
when you found her.
After San Paulo, what happened,
I just couldn't put her
through it anymore.
Yeah, yeah.
No, I told you it was true then
and it was.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dennis, don't... don't question
my trust, please.
Okay.
You want to talk about trust?
Then you trust me
when I tell you to give it up.
What?
This mission of yours.
They killed her for nothing.
Nothing, man!
Look at me. I get it.
You're hurting.
I get it.
You want vengeance.
I was justice.
You want vengeance, Stanley.
I know you.
No. I'm doing this. I have to.
That's it.
Okay. You asked for names.
I got you names.
They're low-level dealers.
Cops haul them in ten times a
year. Nothing ever happens.
What about this guy?
I'm still working on him.
Look. This is my way of helping
you through your grieving.
I owe you that. But we don't
do this anymore, Stanley.
I mean you want to dive back
into this...
I was pushed back into this.
What kept us alive back in the
day? It was just a job.
No emotion.
Nothing to put a pause in our
step or cloud our judgment.
This...
Stanley, this ain't good.
Do you really want to
go down that road?
They already know my name.
Now I know theirs.
That's all I need.
Thank you, my man.
Oh boy.
Whiskey straight.
What up, Nathan?
Lemi says sell this a dime a bag
and nothing less.
Yeah. Got that fine shit.
It's what it is, man.
I dunno what shit
you got yourself into.
But there's a gringo
looking for you.
Well let him come looking.
He's gonna need
some cold damn steel.
Papi, you don't even have money
to put bullets in that gun.
Drinks on me, lady.
Where'd you get that?
I've been busy.
Actually, I got you a little
gift too. Some high-end shit.
See that crack head at the end
of the bar? Who's that?
I dunno.
Why don't you go and find out
if you're so brave?
Don't shoot, man.
Don't shoot.
You lookin' for me?
You must be lookin'
for Jesus too.
My wife had a light about her
that you and your scumbag
friends snuffed out.
For what?
A purse?
A few bucks?
No, man.
It ain't nothin' like that.
That's not how it went down.
How did it go down?
You tell me.
And then we'll both know.
You really
have no damn idea, do you?
Where's Charley Lawes?
That man with the fly tattoo
on his face. Where is he?
Up your ass.
What,
you're gonna kill me now?
Come on!
It's the best shot.
It's the best shot.
Three minutes.
Your call.
What are you doing here?
Really?
You don't want backup
in a neighborhood like this?
What, are you kidding me?
Put that in there.
I'm supposed to thank you now
or something?
Hey, thank me, don't thank me.
I don't care,
You know, I'm telling ya...
You really got a bad attitude.
We need to talk.
You're supposed to
count to three.
Is that right?
Yeah. One, two, three.
Not one freakin' boom.
I've always said it takes a
certain kind of man
to wolf down food
after doing this type of work.
Why are you shadowing me?
I told you I got this.
Yeah.
So far you've just been lucky.
Yeah, well I got out alive.
And where was your secondary
escape route?
Ugh, please.
You engaged too long.
You were exposed.
What if the target had had
a better weapon
or training
or backup?
Look, Stan.
You can't afford to
screw this up.
Abbie's already
lost one parent.
That's on me.
Just me.
I asked for intel. That's it.
You're not tasked to do this.
Let me tell you something.
The second I saw Vivian on the
news, I was tasked to this.
Do you think I was surprised
when you contacted me?
No, I was waiting.
You were lucky tonight. Luck
will run out on you. I won't.
Yeah, all right.
What do we got here?
Let's see.
Broken cell phone.
I'll take this back to the shop.
See what I can do.
What else we got?
Oh wow.
Let me guess. Drugs.
You got drugs in there?
Well?
Two bastards just capped Nathan,
man.
Did they steal the crystal?
No, that's the thing.
They left the drugs.
They were looking for Charley.
Who are these assholes?
I don't know, man.
The whole shit was random.
Nothing's random.
Well, here.
Check this out.
You sat there taking pictures
while they capped my boy?
No, man. It wasn't like that.
There was two of them.
It's okay.
Afghan kush.
Now you know
this is gonna cost you, right?
What do you need, man? Anything.
That ring.
I always liked that ring.
Take it.
I like the way it looks
on<i> your</i> finger.
Katya!
Come on, man! What is this?
Please. Shit, man!
Oh come on, man! Please! Fuck!
Call Charley Fly.
Find these assholes.
Find their families.
Find their dogs.
And kill them all.
It's good to see you eating
again.
Yeah, well I feel a bit better.
You know I spoke to
an old buddy of mine,
and he kinda put things
in perspective for me.
Who?
Well you wouldn't know him. He's
just an old friend.
But he, he said you know Stan,
these street guys...
They're all
gonna end up dead soon enough.
And maybe you should just let
the police do their job.
Oh, one can only hope.
Hey.
I'm gonna pack up
some of mom's stuff.
I thought it'd be a good idea
to get it out of the house.
If that's okay with you.
Yeah.
Okay. Well if Mike and I
can borrow the Explorer,
we could come by tomorrow
before his shift.
Okay, well then I'll just leave
the keys on the hook.
Perfect.
Oh, that's him.
I told him I'd see him today,
so...
I should probably get going.
Okay.
I'll get the check.
Miss?
Hey, boys.
<i>Hey, boss.</i>
We'll be downstairs
checking the pipes.
<i>Cool.</i>
Josh, you got a parking ticket.
Ah, shit.
We do pretty well
at the barber shop.
We still run a little intel
on the side.
Custom made weapons,
that kind of thing.
Just enough
to keep life interesting.
Wow.
Nice set-up.
Yeah.
Now, I know you really love
your beretta and crank gun,
but you need options.
Right tool for the job.
Come here.
And if you find some asshole
who wants to get up close
and personal with you,...
Voilà.
Impressive. Damn.
Self-protection.
Latest and greatest
in body armor.
Check that out. It's like
putting silk on your ass.
Any luck with that cell phone?
Ah, it's gonna take
a little bit of time.
I got to run it on a program
from like 1994.
Hey.
No one likes a show off.
All right, hot shot.
Try the 45.
So, let's say you manage
to ice these two pricks
without getting yourself killed.
Then what?
Do you think you can go back to
your old life?
You're kicking a hornet's nest
here, pal.
I mean who knows how many of
them are gonna crawl out of there.
The way I see it, you either got
to kill them all or run.
I'm not running.
I know a guy who does papers.
What are you suggesting?
Some place a little more
equatorial.
Nah, I'll worry about it
at the time.
Stan, you may not have that
luxury. I'm just saying...
If you have like life insurance
for Abbie to collect on.
You know me.
You disappear...
I'll make damn sure
they find your car
with a burned body in it.
I'm good, man.
Good. It's all good.
I think we got something.
What do you got?
A broken burner
with only one number on it.
Let's try it.
This number could be
Lars or Charley Fly.
Put it on speaker.
Uh huh.
<i>Zombie Tattoo. Hello?</i>
Is Lars there?
<i>No, not now.</i>
Oh. When will he be back?
<i>Not sure.</i>
<i>He's freelance, so it's hard...</i>
How 'bout Charley?
<i>Who is this?</i>
I always wanted a tattoo.
No more arrests
for the rest of the night.
What's shakin'?
Lemi K wants to see you.
Now.
You are supposed to be
protecting me and my people.
Do you need a little reminder?
<i>Help her! Somebody help her!
Hey, man! What'd you give her?</i>
That's the governor's kid.
He looks good, doesn't he?
Remember.
Anything happens to me
or my boys,
you know that's going online.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We kept Charley's ass out of
jail even after a positive ID.
What's your problem?
What's my problem?
My problem is I got guys
clockin' my operation.
Someone chases my boy Nate
out of the Tick Tock
and puts one in his face!
Hey! Your boy Nate gets capped,
that's not our business.
Yes, it is.
That's my merchandise.
You're detectives.
So go fuckin' detect.
Find the guys who did this or
I send the governor a message.
I'm on my way.
<i>Got to meet you there. The alarm
just tripped at the shop.</i>
Okay.
At this point in the speech,
I'm gonna talk about how the
Pipeline's gotten a clean report
from the EPA and my
independent consultants.
So the project's a go.
<i>Okay.</i>
Not my wife?
Detective Gilmore.
Again?
Gimme.
Detective. Very busy.
How can I help you?
<i>We have to talk. Now.</i>
Thank you very much, ladies.
Have a good night.
Take care of your tattoos.
Too late for a tat?
No. I can get you in tonight,
man. What are you looking to do?
Lars around?
He is not around.
Too bad.
I heard he was the best.
Lars is good.
But I'm a little better.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool.
Give us a minute.
We got a situation, sir.
Two minutes, detective.
Involving your son.
What?
Well, there was a homicide a
couple days ago on the streets
of the Short North. Scumbag
nobody's gonna miss. But...
He works for
Lemi K's organization.
The word is somebody's
gunning for Lemi K's boys.
Well that'd solve a big problem
for me.
Not if we remember
he's a psychopath.
All right,
he'll expose the video.
He's not stupid.
He's planned for that.
Why is he being hit?
We don't know yet.
<i>Contain</i> this situation,
detective.
That's what I do all day long.
You wanna know how an Irish kid
raised on welfare
became governor...
Hmm?
How a homicide detective
becomes Captain?
We contain situations.
We don't blow them up.
There may be civilians involved.
Who?
Work with me.
Then we'll find out.
We're done here.
So, you know Lars?
Nah, not really.
My daughter does though.
She...
We've had a falling out
over some of her friends.
One of them Lars?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And another guy. Charlie
something or someone.
Eh.
Ya know.
I'm probably too overprotective.
Maybe if I met them
or I spent some time with them,
maybe I'd feel differently. But,
Well we've had a falling out
over that.
Eh, but she's old enough to
choose her own friends,
you know?
So how long
you owned this place?
A locked door means
we're closed.
And this gun means you're open.
Step down here, princess.
Come on down.
Nice spot you got here, brother.
Yeah, it was.
We just want to ask you
a few questions.
Fire away.
Well, not literally.
Hijo de la gran puta.
Funny guy, huh?
So, you and your friend
are messing with my boys.
Does that freshen your memory?
Who's that?
Look at the fucking picture.
Who is that?
I need a name.
That's a nice tattoo.
Is that a ladybug?
I need a name.
All right, do you want me to
look off that thing
and try and find...
That really
hurt my leg!
Oh, you son of a bitch.
All right, let's go.
Hey, Lars.
What's up?
We were just talking about you.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
But I don't want to get involved
in anybody's family business.
Well who can blame you?
Right.
Well this is the guy you
originally wanted.
So you mind if he
finishes up here?
Yeah.
Is that cool?
Yeah, sure.
Good luck.
That's some heavy shit, man.
What is it, biblical?
Yeah, book of Jeremiah.
So,
what's this my boy's talking
about? Family business?
Yeah. My daughter, she...
She told me you were the best
ink man in town.
Smart girl.
What did you say her name was?
Laura. She,
she told me you did this
really cool like fly tattoo
on her friend.
I think his name was Charlie
or something.
Charlie?
Yeah.
Maybe.
Lot of fools
come through here, man.
Not bad.
Don't move.
It's still wet.
Get up, asshole.
You.
Come on.
Where's Charley?!
I dunno!
Take his stash!
It's in the back!
Where is he?!
<i>Stanley, you all right?</i>
Something's wrong.
<i>Yeah, I know. Three assholes
just redecorated the barbershop.</i>
<i>Meet me at Teto's.
We have garbage to dispose of.</i>
Those assholes who
wanted to dance with me,
they were looking for you.
Charley Lawes.
That's a good guess.
This was his.
Whoa. That won't go unnoticed.
No. This will bring him
right to us.
All right, let's set up the
sting for tomorrow night.
Hey, Stan! Be careful.
Buckle up.
<i>Stanley?</i>
I know I don't have
the right to be here.
But please...
Tell me when to stop.
<i>You made a big change for me
a long time ago.</i>
May I join you?
Grief is a funny thing.
It can ruin a man
or make him stronger.
Strange.
Right or wrong,
I have purpose now.
What purpose is that?
Dad?
Did he leave the keys?
I'll go check.
Boxes there and there.
May I ask you a question,
Father?
Of course.
There are...
There are things I've done.
Many years ago.
What do you think, Stan?
Is it possible that Vivian died
because of the things I did?
My soul is damned.
I'll never see her again.
Aren't those the rules?
You see this praying card?
The man crucified beside Him
is known by few.
A thief,
a corrupt man
of the lowest order.
And yet moments before his
death, Jesus told him:
"Before dawn, we will dwell
together in my Father's house."
I'm...
I don't understand.
It's simple.
<i>Whatever your sins are,</i>
<i>they've already been forgiven.</i>
If you have a heavy heart,
we have the
sacrament of confession.
Vows of silence.
Bless me Father,
for I have sinned.
It's been
many years
since my last confession.
And these are my...
These are my sins.
I've killed many men.
Some for a reason, some not.
Hey, what took you so long?
You okay?
No, I'm not.
We'll talk about it on the way.
I'm running late.
Yeah.
<i>That's the car. Take them out.</i>
All right.
Let's hurt them.
Here it is.
Abbie!
What happened?!
Oh my God!
Where did you get hit?
He shot Mike!
Shoulder.
Shoulder. Let me see.
Let me see.
Just hold it. Just hold it right there. It's
all right. It's all right. It's all right.
Here. Take one of these.
Just hold pressure.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.
Listen. Did you see anything?
No.
Anybody?
A car? A coat?
They were after you,
weren't they?
I know what you're doing.
I saw that gun.
Oh come on.
Who's next? Me?
No.
Jimmy?
I promise nothing will ever
happen to you or Jimmy.
It just did.
Let's get him to the hospital.
But just to be safe, I want you
and Jimmy to get to a hotel.
You're telling me
the manager of a car factory
is picking off Lemi K's crew?
From what my friend
in the bureau tells me,
he used to be in a very
different line of work.
Black ops, special forces,
the real ghost stuff.
Are you shitting me?
<i>Your driver's ready.</i>
Baby, give me a second. Will ya?
Still, he's just one man.
Two.
Apparently he's teamed up
with his old partner.
Deal with it. Or you can forget
about becoming Captain.
You'll be rotting in a jail.
Yeah?
Right next to you and your son.
Don't you threaten me.
Look.
We're gonna make this go away.
Yeah. I'm done with amateurs,
detective.
You get me professionals
to finish this job.
I don't care what it costs.
Oh, what a joke.
Her right eye's popping right
out of her head.
Rich bitch.
Hey. Hold on for a second, man.
I got to take this call, man.
Hold on for a minute.
Dude.
You're jamming me right now.
I'm trying to...
Shut up.
Why are we light, Chuck?
Where the hell is your 50K
shipment from the tattoo parlor?
What? Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yo, we lost some staff, man.
No, we lost a shipment.
Now I'm not gonna accuse you.
I'm just gonna find you and jam
a crowbar up your ass
if that shit doesn't reappear
tonight.
You understand me?
All right, just chill.
All right?
Let me figure this shit out.
I got this.
I got Charley's number.
All right. Let's chit chat.
Mm-hmm.
What the hell?
What?
Should we pick the place?
No. Let him.
It'll make him feel safe.
Besides, I know that joint.
It's got plenty of exits.
You still go to clubs?
Eh, I like Korean food.
What can I get you?
Scotch on the rocks.
Scotch on the rocks.
Mind if I join you?
Ohhh.
Yeah.
No.
I got to take care
of some business tonight.
Business?
Call me!
Thank you.
You like that?
Yeah, I like that.
That's great.
So, you gonna come?
Hey, listen!
Hey, you!
You can't come in here.
Everybody stay down!
You got three minutes.
Keep the stash, man! Everything!
I don't want it.
Well what do you want?
It wasn't an accident that I met
you, was it?
If I tell you, I'm dead.
I'm not fucking stupid.
Who ordered you to kill my wife?
Come on, man.
It wasn't my decision.
Make that one minute!
Lemi K!
It was Lemi K!
Lemi K? Why?
Why did he have you
kill my wife?
It's not my fault
she's a nosy bitch!
Stan, it's time!
It's a flesh wound.
But to answer your question,
yeah I've heard of Lemi K.
Okay, who is he?
Some Armenian douchebag
out of Detroit.
Came to Columbus
a couple years back.
Basically took over the drug
trade one block at a time.
Yeah, but Charley Lawes
and his gang kick up to him.
Yeah, well word is that Lemi K
ate some dude's fingers
in front of his crew.
He's obviously one
of those dramatic types.
Good. Predictable.
Yeah. But dangerous.
I mean you saw the heat
that he's capable of bringing.
Those guys tonight,
they were pros. Now Stan...
You got the guys who murdered
Vivian. Maybe it's time
just to cash in your chips,
head south, and stay there.
No, no, no.
It's not over. It's not over.
<i>Okay, you guys. Ready?
Grandpa wants us to hurry.</i>
Here. Jen, get him dressed.
We need to go.
Okay.
Aunt Jenna, it's your turn.
Thank you.
I don't wanna go.
I know.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.
I'm sorry, little man.
But grandpa needs us
to go someplace.
Where?
To a hotel. But you know what,
you're gonna love it.
Because they have
an indoor pool.
Cool!
I know. And guess what?
I packed your bathing suit.
So? How'd it work out
with your boss?
Not so good.
Well, what do you mean?
<i>The Corner Turn Pipeline
could be a boon for this state.</i>
My office has commissioned
its own environmental review
to compare with the EPA's audit.
It's not my fault
she's a nosy bitch!
<i>Vivian Hill.</i>
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>
<i>First unheard message.</i>
<i>Hey Vivian, it's Glenn. Listen.</i>
<i>We can't submit those original
numbers to the Governor.</i>
<i>I went over the implications
with him. And</i>
<i>we're gonna have to go with
the revised figures I gave you.</i>
<i>We have to.</i>
All set? Let's go.
Ugh, I forgot my phone again.
Stick around.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for your father.
He's not here.
Get him!
Call now!
My phone is in the kitchen.
Go get it. Go get it!
Jenna.
No!
You're next! Understand!
No! No!
Your father.
I want him here!
Now!
Mom!
It's okay, baby.
Dennis, listen.
She never texts me.
She called her son Joey, not
Jimmy. No, something's wrong.
<i>I got you.
Give me the address.</i>
All right.
Let me forward it to you.
Done.
Look at me. You be my brave,
brave boy. Okay?
You're not gonna get hurt. I'm
not gonna let anybody hurt you.
You be mommy's brave...
Come here. Chicks and kids.
I hate this shit!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Kick it over.
Hands up.
Abbie, I got you.
Man, you're a pain in the ass.
Is your daughter so hard?
I so want to kill you.
I'm right here, bitch!
Abbie!
Get him upstairs.
Get him upstairs.
Hey!
There is no reason on earth
that my wife would have anything
to do with a scumbag like you.
So who's behind this?
Who is behind it? Who?
It's, it's...
You wouldn't believe me.
It goes right to the top.
The governor?
Did Meserve order this hit?
Did Meserve order the hit?!
He always did have a big mouth.
Freakin' tweaker.
I guess the cat's out of the
bag, Mr. Hill. Bad guy's dead.
Now.
You and I work together,
maybe we can put this
all behind us.
So how do you want to
settle this?
The easy way
or the hard way?
The hard way.
Okay.
Well that's your call.
But fair is fair.
I should tell you
I brought my own backup.
So did I.
All right.
Let's rethink this.
Maybe...
Maybe there's an easier way.
On come on.
Can he even breathe back there?
Exactly
how do you figure this is gonna
play out for you, Mr. Hill?
I dunno.
What do you think?
You come after me and my family.
But there are drug dealers and
murderers left on the street.
You let my wife's killer go.
You think I don't want to
clip those assholes?
Why was Lemi K untouchable?
It's a party.
Lemi K,
he gets the whole thing
on video.
Including Jr.'s underage
girlfriend seizing up and dying
from some bad crystal.
So Lemi had him on the short
leash, huh?
Yeah, well it cuts both ways.
Lemi does shit for him too.
Like murdering my wife?
Listen, I had nothing to do with
that. Neither did my partner.
Well you do now.
How much farther?
It's...
It's just right up ahead.
That's it.
You make this work.
Hide those cuffs.
You don't think he knows
you'd try this?
That's double the normal
security out there.
That's not your problem.
Don't be stupid.
Just un-cuff me.
Let me talk to him for you,
and we'll make all this go away.
<i>Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!</i>
<i>Hey! I can't breathe!</i>
Shut up!
Let me figure this out!
What?
<i>There's a cop out at the
south gate. South gate report!</i>
Don't move!
You must be Stanley Hill.
Black ops turned car guy.
How many more are there?
I'm alone.
What do you want?
Justice.
Wrong branch of government.
You had my wife killed because
she wouldn't cover up a report.
I used to be a bottom-feeder
like you, Stanley.
Following orders
instead of giving them.
But then I learned the way
the world works.
The trade-offs that must be made
for the greater good.
Your greater good.
Who else knows about that
report?
Everybody knows.
Guys like you,
they fly too close to the vest.
No. This time I made sure.
Who the hell are you?
I am wrath.
Oh my god!
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
It's over.
Stanley Hill.
We know who you are. Drop your
weapon and raise your hands.
Drop your weapon
or we will open fire.
Just check his vitals for me.
Okay, your father's condition
has stabilized.
Okay, I've gone ahead
and given the approval
for him to be transferred
in the morning.
What do you mean, transferred?
Umm, perhaps you need to discuss
that with your attorney.
What is going on?
It's been three days.
When do I get to speak to him?
The DA'S office
has filed a gag order.
Of course they have.
The DA's probably just as guilty
as the rest of them.
They're going to transfer
your father directly
to a federal prison hospital.
This is crazy.
I thought your firm
could help us.
He hasn't even spoken
to a lawyer.
Because of your father's
background,
this case has been declared an
issue of national security.
Oh my god.
He'll be tried in a fisca court. No jury.
No lawyer.
What? I'm sorry, folks.
Visiting hours are over.
So what?
I just never see him again?
We have our orders.
What do you mean,
visiting hours?
We haven't been able
to visit him at all.
Ma'am!
Ma'am, I need you
to come out here right now.
I love you.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Get off of me. I got it. Fine.
I'm sorry, officer. We're leaving.
Yes.
Fellas.
Hey. What's going on, guys?
It's been a long day.
Here to relieve you
for the midnight shift.
I appreciate that.
Why don't you run and grab us
a couple coffees?
Okay.
Mr. Hill.
It's time to settle the score
for what you did
to me and my partner.
You know after I shoot you
for trying to escape,
I'll be the hero.
They might even let me be a
detective again.
I got to wonder what's going on
in that mind of yours right now.
I was thinking about
my daughter.
How much I love her.
<i>Ma'am. Ma'am, I need you
to come out here right now.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
How much I love my wife.
And you.
And your partner.
And that you're just punks.
Is he dead?
Well he's not looking that well.
What were you thinking?
I had him.
Please. From where I'm sitting,
he had me first.
No. I had him, Stan.
And there's no need to thank me.
But next time, do me a favor.
Just hold your fire.
Thank you for what?
For the rescue.
The rescue? That's...
You're too late for a rescue.
Really?
Yeah.
Really? What was...
What was your plan
after you emptied your clip
from a hospital bed?
You gonna fight the cops off
with your bedpan?
It was a one step plan.
That's all I'm sayin'.
Fortunately,
I have a multi-step plan.
And I packed a little bag
for you.
Where are we going?
Well hopefully
anyplace but a
federal penitentiary.
You got three minutes.
Got a jet waiting for us in
Cincinnati. We'll fly south,
gas up in Ixtapa,
and keep going.
I saved your ass last time
in Ixtapa.
No, I saved your ass.
<i>Security, there's
been a breach in ICU Ward 3.</i>
<i>Repeat. Security. All stand by
orderlies report immediately.</i>
Thank you.
You're a wild man.
I'm not wild!
Yes, you are. You're a wild man.
No, I am not! No, I am not!
<i>My darling Abbie, I'm alive
and well, thanks to you.</i>
<i>You truly are my daughter.</i>
<i>Until we meet again, my heart is
with you and Michael and Jimmy.</i>
<i>Love, dad.</i>
