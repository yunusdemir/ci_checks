'This is "Masterpiece."
I have congratulated
the new French Republic
on their liberation
from an odious tyrant.
'Previously, on "Victoria"...
Do you know why
we asked you here?
Because I'm an asset
to any gathering, ma'am?
This country needs more
than bluster, it needs change.
Feodora,
the queen's half sister.
Didn't know
she had a sister.
I don't want to be
the stupid king!
What a temper.
Working for the queen,
and you a Chartist.
Raise the alarm!
We must go now!
"Victoria,"
♪ Gloriana
♪ Hallelujah
♪ Gloriana
♪ Hallelujah
♪ Gloriana, hallelujah
♪ Hallelujah.
Vive la republic!
Vive la republic!
Is Mama going to die?
If she does, you'll be king
and you'll have a crown
and everybody will
curtsy to you, Bertie.
Why do I have to be king?
You just do!
But you're older than me.
Yes, but you're a boy.
But Mama isn't a boy.
Don't you know anything?
It's called
primo geniture, Bertie.
They only make a girl queen
if they can't find anybody else.
(What are you two
doing out of bed?)
Come along!
Get back!
Screaming won't make it
come any faster.
Are we safe?
Go!
I will take care
of Victoria.
Go!
Please God,
don't let Mama die.
I want guards right around
the perimeter of the palace.
Everywhere.
Is that understood?
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
Good.
One of them was in a
comment va dire...
A swing...
A swing!
By all, that's splendid!
Don't you think, Alfred?
Mon cher, please,
come and join us.
Sir, I-I thought the king
would be safer here.
Gambling?
At a time like this?
Life is a game of chance,
maybe I will lose
this hand as well.
Sir, the queen
is asking for you.
I believe the moment
has come.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
As a member
of the Privy Council,
I am required to attend
a royal birth,
to make sure
it's the genuine article.
(Then why are you playing cards
with Louis Philippe?)
You know the prince loathes
this kind of thing.
Oh, what a courtier
you've become, my dear.
Monmouth...
Albert!
The mob has dispersed.
The rioting cannot continue!
Our movement will only succeed
if we have the support
of respectable people.
We must stay within the law.
Do you really think that a few
signatures and pretty banners
are going to make
the prime minister say,
"Come in, why don't you?
Universal franchise,
what a splendid idea"?
A revolution without teeth
cannot bite.
What's happened to you?
Oh, don't look at me like that,
Abigail.
I want to be a free man,
one worthy of a woman like you.
Oh, hello.
I apologize, Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness,
but I couldn't keep them away
a moment longer.
This one's quite pretty
for an infant.
Better than the last one,
anyway.
I am glad you're not dead,
Mama.
Dear Mama and Papa,
we have come to welcome
our new baby sister.
Oh!
Oh!
And how is my... little niece?
Oh...
Such a flower.
I wonder...
what they will call you,
my kleine maädchen.
We're going to name her
after someone...
Who has a very
special place
in this family.
Albert's mother.
Meet Princess Louise.
Hm.
Ja.
What was that?
The baby must have come.
Yet another royal mouth to feed
when children are starving!
Wellington.
Lady Portman.
Duke.
Duke!
Is this really necessary?
The queen is still weak
after her ordeal.
I can assure you, sir,
I wouldn't be here
unless the necessity
was not of the gravest.
The prime minister
and Palmerston
are also on their way.
Right.
May I congratulate you, ma'am,
on behalf of your government,
and apologize for intruding
at this time.
But our intelligence suggests
that hundreds of thousands
of Chartists
will attempt to deliver
their so-called
"People's Charter"
any day now.
If this gathering were to...
get out of hand.
They must be contained
south of the river.
There have been riots already --
great crowds like this
I can't answer
for what could happen.
But I understood the Chartists
to be a peaceful movement.
Call throwing bricks
through your window peaceful?
I believe that protest
was directed against
the French king.
The duke wants
to station troops
on the bridges.
Cavalry and artillery, ma'am.
Let them know we mean it.
It should never
have come to this.
We have failed these people.
Do we have permission
to mobilize the troops, ma'am?
I...
I don't think it's... necessary.
(Liebes...)
It is the only way
of defending Parliament
and the palace, ma'am.
Perhaps you don't
quite understand
what these Chartists
have in mind.
Actually, Lord Palmerston,
I have spoken with a Chartist,
can you say the same?
With respect, ma'am,
one conversation doesn't
make one an expert.
Please,
remember you are speaking
to the queen.
Beg your pardon.
I allowed my anxiety
to eclipse my good manners.
You must give the order
to mobilize
the troops, ma'am.
To use soldiers to disrupt
a peaceful movement
seems to me the height of folly!
I cannot,
and I will not condone it,
and I will not
sign the order!
Move!
Right, everyone get back!
Stand back there!
What is this?
What right do you have to come
in here?
Did you know anything
about the guns?
Why?
Because I'm Irish?
No!
Patrick Fitzgerald?
I'm arresting you
on a charge of treason.
Let him go!
Come on.
Let him go!
Believe me when I say
I never expected to meet
a woman like you.
We own a hotel.
You've done it?
Without telling me.
The owner's scared stiff
of the Chartists,
so he agreed
to lower the price.
(I wish you'd asked me first.)
And what would you
have said if I had?
"The queen needs me.
I can't abandon her
in her hour of need."
Special license.
You know I can't be married,
I'll have to resign.
You will, yes.
I want to start
our real life, Nancy.
Tomorrow, 3:00, St. Bride's.
I'll be there.
Ah-ah, the queen has only agreed
to see her prime minister.
Banished!
From the Garden of Eden!
Or maybe not.
Rifles?
Enough to arm
a regiment.
This is not
a peaceful protest.
I'm afraid
there is no choice, ma'am.
If the Chartists
are going to protest,
we must put troops
on the street.
Klugscheisser.
~
You speak German?
French and Italian.
I like to understand
who I'm dealing with.
I sometimes I have to
remind myself
that you're foreign secretary.
And what is diplomacy
but a balancing act...
Prime Minister?
~
~
Papa calls me
his philosopher princess.
Of course, you English
were the first people
to get rid of your king.
What happened to him?
They cut off his head
but with an axe.
It took a Frenchman to invent
la guillotine.
What's la guillotine?
Are they going to cut off
your head, Mama?
King Louis says
that's what they do in France
when they have a revolution.
Madame La Guillotine
cuts off their heads
and then they hold them up
by the hair.
It seems His Majesty was rather
colorful in his language.
Vicky, Bertie, come here.
Come here.
Do you think I would let
anyone hurt Mama?
No.
Or any of us
for that matter?
No.
But do you have a sword, Papa?
(Bertie!)
Victoria, it's too soon.
You must rest.
Come here.
Come here.
You frightened my children!
I gave them a little lesson
in French history.
I'm sure they will recover.
No, no, no.
We invited you here
against the advice
of our ministers,
my-my own misgivings,
and this is how
you repay us.
Your children need to know
that life is uncertain,
even here in England.
Nothing will happen
to my children.
I hope you are right.
Your presence here...
is a provocation.
Then I must not
outstay my welcome.
I have nowhere else to go,
but of course that is
of no matter.
Such a look of the prince
she has, ma'am.
The... the seamstress,
the Chartist...
Abigail?
Abigail.
Abigail told me the Chartists
loved their queen.
She was wrong.
And now I need soldiers
to defend me from my own people.
When I was a little girl,
I made a promise to myself,
Skerrett, that I would be
not just a queen,
but a great queen,
whose reign would be remembered
as a glorious one.
Now there are no cheers for me,
only for Lord Palmerston.
Why don't they understand he
only cares about his own glory?
A London crowd would cheer
for anyone
who gave them free beer.
Forgive me, ma'am,
a queen doesn't need
to curry favor.
But I want them to love me.
I want them to love me.
Otherwise, what is the point?
Thank you.
What will they do to Patrick,
Mr. O'Connor?
Well,
if he's found guilty
of treason...
they'll... hang him.
But he told me he had nothing
to do with the guns
and I believe him.
Even if he put them there,
where would he find the money
to buy 500 rifles?
So you believe
Patrick's innocent?
I don't know.
But I do know the government
is frightened
by the power of the people.
Whoa there! Whoa there!
Whoa!
Get that stag out the way, man!
Trouble ahead, sir.
Gentlemen!
Get out!
Palmerston!
Palmerston!
May I be of assistance?
Drink.
Thank you.
Are you sure you aren't hurt?
I think my bonnet
is my only casualty,
and my pride, of course,
Lord Palmerston.
Well, I like nothing more
than ministering
to a duchess in distress.
Have there been so many?
None...
more charming than yourself.
Quite a little
collection.
Oh.
They're for my son.
He... he misses me.
Well, who could blame him?
But it is too dangerous
to go anywhere today
and I would like to know
that you're safe.
Get on then!
Are you sure this will
be necessary, Duke?
There troops are on
the bridges now,
but if the Chartists
do get across the river,
we must be prepared.
They must know that we will
not tolerate insurrection.
Yes, but the Chartists
must be allowed to know
that their cause
is not a hopeless one.
They then need a turnip...
That is not correct,
they-they need a carrot
as well as a stick.
Perhaps, but my priority now
is to keep the queen safe.
Well, there we are
in agreement, Duke.
As soon as the queen can travel,
we shall be leaving for Osborne.
And...
I hope that that
French gentleman...
will be leaving London too.
There we are also in agreement.
He will not be spending
one more night at the palace.
He was most kind,
and of course
when the people saw him,
they were ready to help
set things straight.
I see.
Please tell him
I wish to see him.
Yes, ma'am.
But I thought...
No, no, I don't like him.
But that doesn't...
Feo, I don't expect you
to understand.
You've never been
in my position.
No, it is true.
But I know what it's like
to be threatened by a mob,
and live in a small country
surrounded by enemies.
Langenburg is
hardly the same as England.
How would you know?
Whose fault is that?
You're the one who left!
You didn't even
come to my wedding.
Did it ever occur to you
I couldn't afford it?
Well, if you'd asked...
What, beg money from
my little sister?
No, I wouldn't expect you
to understand.
After all,
you have never been
in my position.
Would you like a marron glacé,
Aunt Feo?
You must pardon my appearance,
Your Majesty,
Lord Alfred said you wanted
to see me at once.
I believe, Lord Palmerston,
you have... quite a following.
I think the people know
what I stand for, ma'am.
The guns that were found,
do you really think they meant
to use them against me?
I think it's a possibility.
That's why we're taking
every precaution.
Am I really so unpopular?
My brother-in-law,
Lord Melbourne,
used to say that
the great British public
isn't known
for its logic, ma'am.
Lord M?
He also said it was the greatest
privilege of his life
to serve as your prime minister.
Would he have advised me
to sign that order?
Setting... troops
against my own people?
I think he would have said
that your safety
is more important
than your popularity, ma'am.
Ah, Feo.
I think it is time
I went back to Langenburg.
Leave?
Now? Why?
I hoped so much
to be of some use, but...
I cannot stay
where I am not wanted.
Oh, well,
I'm not sure Victoria knows
exactly what she wants.
She is often...
volatile after giving birth.
You stay.
Oh!
Where is she?
She's in the garden.
With Lord Palmerston.
Palmerston?
Strange...
Victoria?
Liebes.
My love?
Oh...
You all right?
Did Lord Pilgerstein
upset you?
I keep thinking about the day
of my accession.
All those old men
looking down at me, frowning,
as if...
as if it was all
a dreadful mistake.
And then I went out onto
the balcony and...
I heard it.
I heard the sound
of my people...
cheering.
I knew then what it meant
to be a queen.
It's been there, the bass note
that anchors all the...
noise around me.
It's gone.
Albert, it's...
It's gone.
No, no, no.
You are tired.
Victoria, you are not
seeing things correctly.
Albert, those guns
were meant to kill me!
Which is why
we are going to Osborne
as soon as you are fit
to travel.
No, no, no, Albert, no,
they will call me a coward.
All that matters, Victoria,
is that you and the children
are safe.
I know I am being selfish,
but to me you
are the note
that anchors me to this world.
And I will do anything
to keep you safe from harm.
You are far away, ma chère.
I am sorry to disturb you,
but I have come
to say goodbye.
Do you regret leaving France?
Bien sur.
France is the only civilized
country in the world.
But I would rather
live among savages
than meet Madame La Guillotine.
We're going to...
Osborne in the morning.
And you think
that makes you like me?
A coward?
Listen to me,
life is more important
than a crown.
Where will you go?
Durrant's Hotel.
It is well appointed,
I believe.
No -- no, no, no,
that will never do.
I'll tell Uncle Leopold
to lend you Claremont.
It's out of London
and suitable for a king.
Remember,
you have your family,
ma chère.
Albert says you're
thinking of leaving.
Ja.
I think that would be better.
You are...
You have no room for me.
I was... unkind before.
All I want is to help you.
And you know
you can always trust me
absolutely.
I think perhaps I'm
not used to having a sister.
But I don't want you to leave,
Feo.
Oh Drina!
Ah...
You have no idea
how happy that makes me
Then it's settled,
you will come to Osborne
in the morning.
I must go,
I have to make arrangements for
my son while I'm in Osborne.
But the streets
are not safe.
You must have an escort.
Joseph, please see the Duchess
gets home safely.
Lady Portman.
Yes, of course they speak
English on the Isle of Wight.
Brodie!
I need you
to do something for me.
Now.
But Mr. Penge will kill me.
Please, it's important.
I'm going to take
my atlas of the heavens
then we can look at
the stars together, Papa,
can't we?
Hm.
That's mine!
Ah, Bertie!
Bertie!
Apologize to your sister.
Sorry.
How he reminds me you
at that age, Drina.
While we are in Osborne
I think perhaps we shall
have to teach you how to behave
like a future king.
Bertie doesn't want
to be king.
He thinks that I
would do it better,
and I would, wouldn't I?
Excuse me!
Are you holding
Mr. Patrick Fitzgerald?
There's no one here
by that name.
Now could you move away
from the station.
Patrick!
But what are you doing here?
I've-I've been
looking everywhere.
I-I thought...
My name is Inspector Daubeny.
And I assure you
I've never seen you before
in my life.
What are you
talking about?
But your finger...
It's missing.
How perceptive of you.
Now if you'll excuse me.
'I want to be a free man.
'One worthy of a woman like you.
Please don't go away, Mama.
I hate it when
you aren't here.
And I hate leaving you too.
But I promise I will write
to you every day
But I'm not very good
at reading.
Your Grace.
You left these
in the carriage
and I thought
they might be of use.
Yes.
Look, William.
I have a present for you.
Now I have enough
for a real battle!
Ah, Duchess.
No wonder our son is
falling behind in his lessons
when you insist
on indulging him
in these childish pastimes.
We were just saying goodbye.
Please don't go away, Mama.
Stop sniveling.
Go to your room.
I think it's an excellent thing
you're going to Osborne.
It may be the custom among
the grocer classes
to mollycoddle their sons,
but William will be
a duke one day.
You, get the
duchess's carriage.
I don't want to be king, Mama.
I know, darling.
Come here.
Do you know
what destiny means?
It means that there is
something in your life
you must do.
And my destiny and yours
is to rule this country.
(Think of it as a
little flame inside you.)
(Nothing can put it out, Bertie.)
Vicky is better at numbers.
It doesn't matter.
Aunt Feo was better
at everything than me.
But it is your destiny
to be king.
(I think you'll be a great one.)
I'm here.
And I've brought someone
to give me away.
Let me not to the marriage
of true minds --
Thank you, Brodie.
I, Nancy, take thee Charles...
I, Nancy, take thee Charles
to be my wedded husband.
To have and to hold
from this day forward.
With this ring I thee wed.
With my body I thee worship...
For richer for poorer,
in sickness and in health
to love, cherish,
and to obey
till death us do part.
In the presence of God,
Charles and Nancy
have given their consent,
and made their marriage vows
to each other.
I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.
I have to speak
to the queen.
At once.
I can't just take you in
to see the queen.
Why would she want to see you?
Where I come from,
we speak as we find,
so you can believe me
when I say
this is matter
of life and death.
An agent?
Why would anyone
do such a thing?
I think to make it look
like the Chartists mean
revolution.
And they don't?
All we want is the Charter,
ma'am.
But if there are soldiers
on the streets,
and-and cannons
on every bridge,
then people get to thinking
that it's a battle.
But you said the Chartists
weren't violent.
If we're attacked
we won't run away, ma'am!
(You can't talk to the queen like that.)
It's all right, Skerrett.
I don't think you meant
to be rude.
No, ma'am.
I know you want what's best
for your people, ma'am.
Every day there's a new reason
why we cannot leave.
What if she's right,
Albert?
And the guns were put there
by somebody else?
Victoria,
I know that this distresses you,
but who would do such a thing?
It makes no sense.
If someone wanted to discredit
the Chartists, then...
Look at the facts!
On the one hand we have
the story of a seamstress,
on the other hand
we have rifles.
I think we have to accept
the truth, Victoria,
however unwelcome it may seem.
My sister has always lived
in a world of her own making.
When she was little
I think she preferred
to talk to her dolls than to me,
because they would not
answer back.
She wants to see the best
in her people.
I cannot fault her for that.
Men will be stationed
on every bridge.
We cannot let these
ruffians come near Parliament
or the palace.
The future of this country...
lies in your hands.
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!
'You will be traveling
in the opposite direction
to the Chartists.
The prime minister
and the foreign secretary
will accompany us to the bridge.
Once you have crossed
Waterloo Bridge,
we will make sure that no one
comes the other way.
My troops have their orders.
The Chartists will not
cross the river.
Waterloo Bridge.
I hope that is a good omen,
Duke.
I prefer an enemy in uniform,
sir.
Why are there so many soldiers?
Get away!
Go!
Let go of me!
Stop the carriage.
Albert, stop the carriage!
Stop the carriage!
I need to get out.
I have changed my mind, Duke.
A woman's prerogative,
Ma'am.
The Chartists must be able
to present their petition
to Parliament.
I think that
that is unwise, ma'am.
If we let them over the bridge,
there will be no stopping them.
We don't know that, Duke.
But we do, ma'am.
How many rifles were found
at Kennington Hall?
Was it 400 or was it 500?
I assume that rifles
are costly items, Duke?
I wonder then
how Chartists,
who are working men,
could afford so many?
They are desperate men, ma'am.
Or perhaps the rifles
were put there by somebody else?
What do you think,
Lord Palmerston?
Are you familiar of the notion
of Occam's razor, ma'am?
You have two ideas --
one simple,
and the other based on a series
of unlikely suppositions.
The simple theory is always
more likely to be true.
(Victoria, please, let us go.)
You see,
I don't find it
at all unlikely
that the rifles could have been
put there by...
parties...
anxious to prove
the Chartists guilty.
The petition must go ahead.
As you wish, ma'am.
How the devil did she find out?
Perhaps you're not the only one
with a popular touch, Henry.
Take aim!
Prepare to fire!
Sergeant.
Let them pass.
Company!
Withdraw!
♪ London Bridge
is falling down ♪
♪ Falling down, falling down.
I can't wait to see
Mr. Penge's face
when you tell him.
No, not a word.
I don't want
anyone to know yet.
Not until the queen is safe.
A honeymoon
in the Isle of Wight!
Look!
Coming, Bertie!
Look at this!
(Come with me.)
(I want to show you something.)
What is it?
It's Hercules, the hero,
being held in bondage
by Queen Omphale.
So instead of killing lions...
he is... helping her spin.
I bought it so I can lie
in the bath
and then think of you.
But Osborne
is your kingdom, Albert.
Forgive me
for disturbing you.
This came.
It's from the duke.
The Chartists delivered
their petition...
without incident.
Then you were right,
Liebes.
It seems the English people,
are not revolutionary...
I should have been there,
Albert!
Excuse me.
I should have
been there!
She will feel better soon.
I hope so.
We can take care of her...
together.
'Next time, on "Victoria."
Engage!
Bertie must be disciplined.
Where's your husband, Duchess?
She cries out for something
you will never give her.
There's your goose
well and truly cooked.
Albert, this is an
insubordination I cannot ignore.
Your Majesty!
