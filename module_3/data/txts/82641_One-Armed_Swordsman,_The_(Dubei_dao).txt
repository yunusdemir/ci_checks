So there's one more of them.
Why don't you come out?
Let's get this over with.
I know you followed me from Kasukabe.
You guys are Sugito's men, aren't you?
I guess it's no use.
No way for the dumb and the blind
to communicate.
Ow! Ow!
Hey! This way!
Blind bastard!
Stinking rats.

Thank you.
Pack up everything.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Daddy! Mommy!
This is...
Are you Chinese?
I am.
I never thought I'd see
a fellow countryman in a place like this.
I didn't expect to either.
I'm called Li Xiang.
This is my wife Yumei,
and my son Xiaorong.
I'm Wang Kang.
Japan is a wonderful place.
The climate is good
and the people are kind.
I'm not familiar with this country yet.
Have you come here on business?
I'm a martial artist.
I'm on my way to Fukuryuji Temple
near a place called Mamada,
to pay a visit to a friend.
Mamada?
I'll show you the way.
That would be helpful.
Thank you.
We'll spend the night in town
and leave early tomorrow morning.
I haven't had any news from home
for a long time.
We'll drink some Japanese sake.
Then it's my treat.
Let's make a night of it.
Mr. Wang, it's not right
for you to buy us sake.
We've been in Japan longer.
Let it be our treat.
Please.
My wife is better at invitations
than I am.
I'm not good with words.
As long as you know you'll get sake,
you're happy.
- Don't scold me.
- Let's pack up our things.
TRIBUTE
Oh, no, look.
Xiaorong!
Mr. Wang, we must get out of the way.
This is the law in Japan.
We must follow it too.
Otherwise we'll be punished.
I wonder what this procession is for.
Who knows?
- Xiaorong!
- Insolence!
Ruffian! Wait!
Take Xiaorong and run.
- Don't let them get away!
- Yes, sir.
Keep your post!
- Kuroki.
- Sir?
What became of the Chinese man?
What a mess.
Look,Dad!
Down!
Daddy, don't die.
Little boy, don't cry.
Blood.
Hello? Are you hurt?
Hello?
My...
Child...
help...
him.
Don't die, Daddy.
There are even women.
No!
What's going on?
They're carrying dead bodies.
Dead bodies?
Thank you.
Hey, where's my tea?
Welcome.
What would you like?
<i>We'll</i> have two rice bowls.
All right.
Two large rice bowls.
Hey, guys! Lend a hand.
- With what?
- Hunting down the Chinese man.
The Chinese man is still on the loose?
We've cornered him in the quarry.
The boss wants more men down there.
But we're still eating.
Get off your rear and no grumbling!
If you capture him,
you get a reward of five zyo.
A five-/yo reward!
This is no time to eat!
How dreadful.
Excuse me, what's all this
about a Chinese man?
Huh?
Early this morning,
he attacked the front guards
of the procession of the Nanbu clan.
This Chinese man attacked?
They say he went mad
and even killed peasants and townsfolk
who happened to be there.
I see.
Oh, that reminds me.
Earlier, I came across some carts
hauling away bodies.
What a horrible bastard.
The Nanbu men pursued him
to our area.
I see.
Come on, eat.
Why, are you blind?
Yes.
Is he your boy?
Yes.
What are you wearing?
Oh, please don't mind it.
He fell into a river.
Oh, my, in this cold weather?
It was cold, wasn't it?
You're all right, huh?
He looks nothing like you.
Girls, do they look alike?
No, they don't.
Maybe the boy
is from a different father.
Where did that bastard pick up that kid?
What is your plan, sir?
We can't continue this standoff.
We'll storm the shack.
That will play right into his hand.
Let's force him out.
Daihachi!
- Yes, Boss.
Take two men
and drive him out of there.
Heiji! Gonta!
Bastard!
- Damn him!
- Wait, sir!
We'll burn the shack and smoke him out.
- All right. Do it quick.
- Douse it with oil and light it.
- Yes, Boss.
Damn bastard!
There!
- Don't let him get away!
- After him!
Hurry!
Don't cry.
Boys shouldn't cry so much.
Boy, do you have a place you can go?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I understand.
All right, good.
This Chinese man who killed people
at the procession,
what is he to you?
I don't know.
You don't?
- Mister!
- Xiaorong?
Where are you taking him?
Ah, you must be the Chinese man
who killed the front guards
of the procession.
Let's go.
Hey, where are you taking the boy?
Don't follow me!
Hey, wait.
Wretch!
Hey!
Wait!
Where are you taking the boy?
Dimwit!
I said don't follow me!
Let's go.
An extraordinary fellow.
- Did you find him?
- Where is he?
Keep searching.
That way.
- Hey!
- What?
Where did he ditch the kid?
It feels like I was tricked by a spirit.
I guess those two Chinese people
ended up back together
as they were meant to be.
There's no point in me worrying.
Well, you're still following me?
You followed me here?
Boy, are you here?
Mister.
Ah, you're here.
Here, you must be hungry.
Eat this.
Here you go.
<i>We'll</i> share it like friends, eh?
Here, boy. Have one.
Xiaorong!
You're damn suspicious.
Are you really blind?
“Ma” what?
You mean “manma”? Rice.
There's no poison in it.
Here, drink.
Thank you.
“Xie xie”?
Ah, “sha sha.”
The sound water makes.
By the way,
I heard that you killed innocent people.
Is that true?
If it is, you're in big trouble.
Where are you going from here?
“Ige dang”? Egg?
There's no egg in this.
But it's delicious.
I don't understand what he's saying.
It's so strange that we're both human
yet can't understand each other's words.
Boy, do you know
where this man is going?
I know.
But if I ask you where,
you'll say you don't know, eh?
I know. I know.
All right. Then where?
Fukuryuji Temple.
Fukuryuji Temple?
I've heard of Fukuryuji Temple.
It's the temple near Mamada.
You're going
in the wrong direction, then.
<i>“Fuwuiyf”?</i>
<i>cc F r?</i>
Does he know Fukuryuji?
Ask him to guide us there.
Take us there.
Yes, sir. I will take you there.
Thanks.
Thank you.
“Sha sha”?
You want more water?
You do like drinking water.
Here you go.
It's better if we travel in the dark.
Boy, tell him.
He'll take us there now.
Who's there?
I'm a traveler.
Could I trouble you
for a cup of hot water?
I have a child with me,
and he's feeling the cold.
Thank you.
Come in, all of you.
It's all right.
If you would just help this child.
- Oyone, give him some hot water.
- Yes.
Sorry for the trouble.
His hands are like ice.
Where are you going at this late hour?
Well, we're on our way
to Fukuryuji Temple near Mamada.
To Fukuryuji? That's a long way.
You'll have to travel all night.
Yes.
Here, Mama.
Drink this.
It's hot. Careful.
Thank you.
Oyone, what's wrong?
That Chinese man from this morning.
I'm sorry.
Masseur, are you traveling
with that Chinese man?
Well, actually I met him on the road.
I'm with him since he asked me
to take him to Fukuryuji.
Oshige, bring him inside quickly
and bar the door.
Don't trouble yourself. <i>I'll</i> tell him.
Come inside. Come on.
Thank you.
My, you just missed the men
who are after you.
Boss Tobei of Furukawa's men
were here only a few minutes ago.
Of Furukawa?
Yes, they're searching the entire area
and telling people to report at once
when you're spotted.
A ten-/yo reward has been placed
on the Chinese man.
Ten 13/0?
This boy's parents were
those Chinese people who got killed.
Yes, it seems that's what happened.
I was there with my daughter.
We hid quickly and survived.
But after this Chinese man
killed the Nanbu men and escaped,
what happened was just horrible.
Three samurai
came out of the procession.
And the people who happened to be there,
peasants, travelers and others,
were all murdered by the samurai.
The Nanbu samurai killed them?
So then, it wasn't this Chinese man
who killed those people?
No, although he's blamed for it
in all the rumors.
Why did the samurai
commit such atrocities?
By killing all the witnesses,
they can make up any story
to explain away the incident.
From what I heard,
the procession was carrying
a tribute of abalones to the shogun.
All for some lousy abalones.
Dear, what are we going to do?
They have a child with them.
We'll have to let them spend the night
in the potato shed out back.
Yes.
Oyone, cook something hot for them.
Come on, follow me.
But...
I'd hate to bring you any trouble.
Don't worry, they'll never look
for you there. Come on, now.
Well, in that case...
This way, masseur. Watch your step.
All right.
That bastard, where is he hiding?
It's odd.
We cast our net over the whole area.
Boss, Sugito's men are here.
They have some information on Zatoichi.
Zatoichi?
Is he hanging around in our area?
They say he was with the Chinese man.
What? They said that?
Where are you going?
What? “Chu” what?
I mean, where are you going?
“Ni-san na”? Brother?
“Chunari”? Next door?
Brother next door.
Ah, that's what you said.
I'm going down to town.
For you, I will get...
this...
and be back.
Ah, you mean drinking sake.
What? “Haicho”?
Yes, that's right?
So I'm saying,
I'll go get some sake...
I don't get what he's saying.
Where... you go?
Boy, for you...
I'll get some sweet cakes.
You don't understand, though, do you?
I understand.
You do when it suits you.
Xiaorong, don't go outside.
Poor child.
Where is he going?
Welcome.
Let me have one hot sake.
And can you fill this with sake?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
One hot sake!
Come on, make your bets.
Don't be stingy.
- Give me a second.
- Come on.
I say heads, then it's tails.
I say tails, then it's heads. Right?
That's right.
Are you saying
that you suspect I'm cheating?
No, we're not saying that, but...
Coins have only two sides.
Either heads or tails.
It might be possible to load dice.
But coins don't lie.
Now, are you gonna bet or not?
Well, then...
Hello, there, you're having fun.
Let me join you.
Well, uh...
He's blind.
Blind?
What are you?
Well, I'm a traveling masseur.
He said he's a masseur.
Shut up! I'm not deaf!
You, masseur!
- Yes.
Furukawa is my territory.
I, Henoichi, operate in this town.
Do you mean to challenge me
and break into my territory?
No, I have no intention
of doing any business in this town.
In the event that I decide to stay on,
I will come and pay my respects to you.
I don't have a problem with you, then.
You have funds to bet?
I do. Without funds to bet,
you can't gamble.
All right, I'll put the squeeze on you.
Excuse me.
Have my seat. it's over here.
Hey, two masseurs
are going to squeeze each other.
Neither will see the outcome!
Shut up!
Keep your mouth shut, mud turtle!
Now, then,
how much are you gonna bet?
Well, for the start, ten <i>mon.</i>
<i>Ten mon!</i>
Hear that? He's betting ten <i>mon.</i>
Very well, sir.
Which side will it be, sir?
Heads? Or tails?
Well, let's see. Heads, I think.
Here you go!
Wait, maybe tails.
- Here you go.
- Ah.
No, heads.
- Here you go.
- Tails, maybe.
- Here you go.
Heads, maybe...
Make up your mind.
All right, then. Heads.
Oh, it's tails.
Which side will it be next, sir?
I see. You're very good.
What do you mean?
I don't like that insinuating tone.
Did I touch a nerve?
You did.
But...
What?
You know...
That way it's...
And that's...
What's so funny?
Only you two are in on the joke?
Not funny.
By the way,
was the Chinese man found?
Oh, that?
We nearly had him.
Is that right?
Too bad he got away.
When I glared at him,
he lost his head and took off.
Right?
- I didn't see that.
Idiot, I'm buying you sake,
so say you did.
Oh, right. He did glare at him.
He glared, he did.
Too late now, fool!
But seriously,
he was like a <i>Tengu</i> goblin.
Really?
Yeah. He leaped
and hopped over our heads.
So, Boss Tobei hasn't called off
the search yet?
He not only hasn't called it off,
he's circulating notices everywhere.
It won't be long till we find him,
with the strange way he's dressed.
Why is Boss Tobei so keen
on finding the Chinese man?
That's because -
Because if everything goes well,
Tobei will get the commission to provide
help for the Nanbu clan's processions.
I see.
But Henoichi,
how do you know all that?
The boss suffers
from chronic stiff shoulders,
so he's a regular client of mine.
I wish I had a chance to massage
the shoulders of such a great boss.
If you like, I could introduce you to him.
I'd very much like that sometime.
Would you like a drink?
I'd like a drink too.
Uh, the sake?
Oh, all right.
This is pretty good for a local sake.
Go, hurry.
Hey, what do you think you're doing,
drinking sake in the middle of the day?
Get going now!
- Where to?
We know where
the Chinese man is hiding.
Hurry, get going!
Boss Tobei's men
are already on their way.
Here's money for my bill.
Good luck with the hunt.
Hey, there.
Are you going on the hunt too?
I'm a blind man. I wouldn't take part
in such dangerous things.
Miss, can I have my bamboo bottle?
Yes.
Here you are.
- Thanks.
Here's money for my bill.
Thank you.
What an odd masseur.
I agree.
Bastard!
Dear!
He got away.
- You have men in place?
- Yes, sir.
Sir, <i>I'll</i> take this girl and
beat what she knows out of her.
Do it.
- Masa.
- Yes, sir.
Woman, get up.
Get up. You're coming with me.
Father!
Father!
- Come on, fool!
There he is!
After him!
Don't let him get away!
Did you find him?
No.
Find him!
What will we do?
Yosaku?
Who did this to you?
Hey! Oyone!
Hey!Boy!
I let this happen...
Stubborn bitch!
Hey, we heard he was with a kid.
It must be the kid
who blocked the procession.
<i>He'll</i> be killed if he's captured.
Somebody informed on them.
There was a masseur
with the Chinese man, wasn't there?
Do you know what sort of man
that masseur is?
He's called Zatoichi
and he's a yakuza just like us.
He's a dirty rat
who'll do anything for money.
Did the masseur inform on them?
So the Chinese man
really was hiding at your place.
You must know
where he ﬂed to, don't you?
If you keep up this silent act,
<i>I'll</i> shut your mouth for good,
like we did to your parents!
Well?
Bitch!
Boss!
Zatoichi is here.
- He's here?
- Yes.
- Take this.
- Yes.
I'm Tobei of Furukawa.
What do you want to see me about?
I'm going to skip
the formal introductions.
I came to ask you to hand over
Yosaku's daughter to me.
Yosaku's daughter?
There's no girl here by that name.
It's no use playing dumb.
I know for sure
she was brought here.
Were you trying to help
that Chinese man too?
That's none of your business.
Just do what I -
Pardon me,
all I want is to take the girl home.
Forget it!
You're a reckless fellow,
aiding a criminal
who defied the law of the land.
You make me laugh.
You yourself are a yakuza
who walks the back roads of the law.
You should know it's only human
to help a person in need.
Blind bastard!
Don't get clever with me!
Are you prepared for the consequences
of showing your face here?
No, not at all.
All I want is to take the girl home.
The New Year is coming soon.
Don't throw your lives away.
Back off.
Let me have the girl.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know!
I guess you're deaf.
If this ear can't hear...
How about an eye next?
Bring the girl!
Boss Tobei,
would you show us the way out?
Back off!
Hey, open the door for her.
If they're letting us go,
they should do it pleasantly.
Oyone.
I'm sorry for what happened.
Your parents were like the Buddha.
They didn't deserve to die like that.
This isn't...
very much,
but please buy incense sticks -
So you'll do anything for money?
Even if it means people get murdered?
Who said such a thing?
Tobei said that to you?
I want revenge...
even if takes the rest of my life.
What sin did my father
and mother commit?
All they did was offer some tea
to you, the Chinese man and the boy.
Why were they murdered?
If only they had refused you...
If only they had been less kind...
Oyone.
You wanted the ten-zyo reward,
didn't you?
So you informed on the Chinese man,
didn't you?
A yakuza.
You're no different
from Tobei and his men: a yakuza.
Miss.
I'm sorry. it's my fault.
Believe me. I promise to avenge
the death of your parents.
But who informed on me?
Who could it have been?
Where did the blind man go?
He hasn't come back.
Could it be him?
<i>He kept on following me.</i>
<i>Why did he do that?</i>
<i>If he was doing it
to inform on me...</i>
I will kill him!
We will go to Fukuryuji Temple.
What's with you?
Oh, it's you, lady.
Hello.
You seem really depressed.
No, I'm all right.
What line of business are you in, lady?
Are you trying to embarrass me?
One look at me should tell you.
Oh, but I'm dealing with a blind man.
This mess with the Chinese man
is keeping the men from going out at night.
So business is rotten.
Hey, listen,
I can take you to a nice inn tonight.
Well, thank you for the offer,
but I'm not in the mood for that.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to apologize.
Hey, can I have a drink?
All right.
<i>Now, which side?</i>
- <i>Tails.</i>
- <i>Tails?</i>
<i>That one ﬂipped again</i>
Do you want a couple more?
No, one bottle would be fine.
Just one.
Stingy bastard.
<i>It's tails again! I won again.</i>
<i>Go home.</i>
- Damn it!
- Now, which side?
It's tails again. Tails.
I won! I'm just on a roll tonight.
One more time.
Now, showdown!
Heads! Heads!
It's tails! Tails!
- Don't bother me.
- Damn!
Get lost, jerk!
What the hell do you mean
by hitting a gambler's shoulder -
Uh...
Here's some hot sake.
Oh, all right.
Thanks.
Ah, thanks.
You guys are Sugito's gang.
It was you who ratted
on the Chinese man.
Shut up, blind bastard!
<i>We'll</i> follow you to hell itself,
to make sure you're dead.
Hey.
Don't throw your lives away.
Excuse me.
What is it?
Is there a Chinese man with a child
at this temple?
You mean Wang Kang?
Wang Kang?
I don't know his name,
but he is here?
He is.
I see. I'm relieved to hear that.
Will he be staying at this temple
for a while?
There's also a girl named Oyone,
who guided them here.
OYOne is?
Do you know her?
No, not really.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Wang Kang, a blind man
came looking for you.
What? A blind man
came looking for me?
Where is he?
Wait.
The abbot said you must not step
outside the gates. What's wrong?
So when you told him
we were here, he simply left?
Who is that blind man?
He's a yakuza named Zatoichi.
- Zatoichi?
- Yes.
Wang Kang was furious
when I told him about the blind man.
Do you know the reason?
The abbot told you not to talk about it?
But I am an exception.
When I went to China for training,
Wang Kang and I ate from the same pot.
I'm concerned about him.
Won't you tell me?
He is hunted by samurai
of the Nanbu clan.
Why?
To save this boy, he killed samurai
in the procession.
The blind man informed them
that he was hiding with us.
All for a reward of ten 11/0.
As a result, my parents were...
They were killed?
Are we safe here?
He might do the same thing.
Do not worry.
Not even the Nanbu clansmen
can raid the temple without permission.
Xiaorong.
What are you talking about?
Oyone says
she's quite fond of you.
She's fond of me?
What did you tell him?
That you were fond of Wang Kang.
I'm still wondering.
Where did lchi disappear to?
Who's lchi?
You know, Zatoichi.
Don't act like you're his friend.
But I shared sake with him.
He bought you sake.
Well.
So, what do you think?
About what?
You know, whether or not lchi
is still here in Furukawa.
I think he's still here.
It's a blind man's hunch.
I don't know. I think he's gone.
Even for lchi, it's too much
to go up against Boss Tobei.
“While there's life, there's rope,”
as they say.
“Hope,” you half-wit.
Who cares.
Hey, wanna make a bet?
- Sure.
- Kame, which side are you with?
- I'm with Henoichi.
Bastard! Traitor!
Well, I'm sorry,
but it's pretty obvious that he's right.
You know that we're betting
on whether lchi is still here or not?
Yeah, I know he's here.
- Where?
- Right behind you.
- Good evening!
- Hello.
You're having fun.
Old man, I'll have a hot sake.
Hey, Hiko, change places with me.
Hello, lchi.
- Hello, Henoichi.
You know what?
When I saw you around -
it's odd for a blind man
to say “saw you around” -
Someone asked me
to take you somewhere.
- Who asked?
- It's better I don't tell you.
Let me finish my drink.
No, no, you can have drinks
where you're going.
Henoichi, your cane.
Thanks.
Here you go.
What's -
Sorry.
Can you tell whose place this is?
Lady.
How much did you pay those guys?
One 11/0.
I hear the sound of running water.
There's a river out back.
The sound of water is nice.
I feel like it's purifying me.
Oh, thanks.
- Come inside.
- All right.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry the place is so dirty.
Lady, don't make fun of the blind.
I just get the feeling that you see
even better than sighted people.
Excuse me.
Give me a minute.
<i>I'll</i> prepare some hot sake.
Don't mind me.
I'm scared about what will come later.
I wanted to serve you a drink
the instant you came,
so I've been waiting
with a tray set aside at the ready.
I want to be of use to you.
I wonder if you mean that.
If you don't believe me...
then sleep with me.
What's wrong?
Hey.
I heard a strange sound.
What's up?
What's up? You kidding me?
My nose is about to drop off,
and my eyes are about to pop out.
I see what you mean.
This is really nasty.
Is no one in?
Coming.
You're only a beggar monk.
You've got some attitude.
We have no use for you.
Go away!
But I do, even if you don't.
That is why I took the trouble to come.
Let Tobei know that I have come.
JOSHUYA INN
I'm sorry, but I decline your proposal.
But, sir.
For my part, I can't burden our clan
with any more expenses.
I wonder.
If the disturbance of the procession
by a foreigner
and your subsequent attempts
to conceal it become known,
the Nanbu clan will lose face.
If you can save face for 1,000 /yo,
I don't think it's too much to ask.
If the foreigner ﬂees
to the domains of your clan's enemies,
he will be out of your reach.
- That's not -
- it is a possibility, still!
Depending on how things turn out,
I might approach them myself.
- What!
- Wait!
All right, I will accept your proposal.
What is your plan?
Excuse me,
your clansmen have arrived from Edo.
- They're here?
- Yes.
Welcome.
This way, please.
Good to see you.
Do you know his whereabouts?
An informerjust came to see me.
I'll take you to him.
Come inside.
I've really had too much to drink.
I brought this sake especially for you.
Come on, have some more.
Thanks.
Kakuzen, I crossed the sea
to come all the way to Japan
and get away
from all the fighting at Jiang-hu.
But it's no different anywhere you go.
I can't believe I wound up in this mess.
Forget about it.
You've never been the one
to draw his sword first.
That's right, I never drew first.
I know that.
Thanks.
You are indeed a trusted friend.
Hey, you'll catch cold.
Hey.
Retreat! Retreat!
Don't chase them!
It's terrible!
Xiaorong has been taken!
What's the matter?
She said that Xiaorong
has been taken.
Xiaorong has been taken?
Wang Kang.
It says if you come
to the specified location,
the child will not be harmed.
How did they learn so quickly
that he was here?
Perhaps that blind man
informed on you.
A blind man came looking for him?
I should have been more careful.
I thought he simply came to visit them,
so I told him they were here.
If you go,
you will be risking your life.
One cannot fear death
if one hopes to accomplish something.
I'd go anywhere to save the boy.
Kakuzen, Oyone cares for Xiaorong
as if he were her very own brother.
Tell her not to worry.
Yes.
Damn bitch, where did she go?
Go look that way.
- Yes.
- Hey, brother.
- You didn't find her?
Go look that way.
- Yes.
Hey, did you see a woman
around here?
A woman?
There are three women here.
Silly woman.
Same to you, jerk.
They're gone.
Better not come out yet.
But why are you being hunted down
by guys like them?
There must be a reason for it.
If you can't talk about it, I won't ask.
I'm sorry.
Do you happen to know
where the samurai of Nanbu
are staying?
Wait a minute.
Is your name Oyone, by any chance?
How do you know?
There's someone I want you to see.
Come with me.
Why are trying to run?
Osen, who's with you?
It's Oyone.
OyOne?
Oyone, why did you leave the temple?
She said she needs to see
the samurai of Nanbu.
The samurai of Nanbu?
Did something happen?
You must know exactly
what happened.
Why did you come to Fukuryuji Temple?
Because -
That poor boy.
The boy?
So...
why do you need to see
the samurai of Nanbu?
If possible, I want to take his place.
He's alone
in a place he doesn't know.
How scared he must be.
What demands
did the Nanbu men make?
They will forgive the boy's crime
if the Chinese man comes to them.
But knowing that
<i>he'll</i> meet his death there,
I can't just sit by and let it happen.
No matter how much you plead,
they won't listen to you.
Then what am I supposed to do?
What else is there I can do?
When and where
will the exchange take place?
I don't know.
Stop this!
Don't get involved any further.
You wanna throw your life away?
Osen, I want to ask you
to do me a favor.
I know.
You want me to investigate.
You're a fool, and so am I.
Osen.
What?
Oh, it's cold.
- Masa.
- Oh, it's you, Osen.
Bring me some sake.
It really is cold.
What is it?
I keep my hands off of whores.
That's not what I'm here for.
Did you find the girl?
Not yet.
Is there a reward?
You know where she is?
Yeah.
You'll get your reward later.
I want it now.
Here you go.
She's at my place.
What? Guys!
Tell me something.
What?
Where is the boy?
I don't -
You don't know?
You're going to use the boy as bait
to make the Chinese man show himself,
and then you'll kill both of them.
That's what the Nanbu men are planning.
Where?
Bodaijihara.
When?
Tomorrow morning at 6:00.
Who informed you that the Chinese man
was at Fukuryuji Temple?
Kakuzen, a monk at the temple.
It was the monk.
Ichi!
Henoichi, over here.
Ichi, you know, that -
The boy.
The boy will be sent to Nanbu.
These guys heard about it.
Is that true? When?
Tonight.
Osen, how do I get from here
to the Mito highway?
I'll take you there.
Leave the child there.
Who's there?
Show yourself!
I'm over here.
Jizo, guardian of children,
sent me to rescue the boy.
What!
<i>BOY -</i>
Mister!
You bastard!
Have your men positioned
at strategic points.
<i>I'll do that, sir.</i>
The only concern is that bastard lchi.
Hasn't he left this area?
The blind hold grudges,
and it seems that he's still in town.
Make sure he doesn't leave this town.
Leave it to me, sir.
For my own reasons,
I want that bastard dead too!
Oyone, there's nothing to worry about.
<i>I'll</i> bring back the Chinese man
safe and sound, too.
I'm sorry.
I was a fool.
I was convinced
it was all your doing.
Forget about it.
But still, that shit of a monk
is a real bastard
to betray his own friend.
Oyone...
you should leave this awful place...
What did you find out?
Tobei's men are moving about
all over the town.
They told us girls to stay off the streets
if we didn't want to get hurt.
Brother.
The blind bastard showed up after all.
Serves you right, blind bastard!
Guys, drag him out
and cut him to pieces!
Yes, sir.
Hey, move the carts away!
He's buried underneath.
Damn it!
Ichi! You're not getting out
of this town alive!
Is that Boss Tobei?
You'll lose more than an ear
this time!
What?
Stick to blowing the masseur's whistle,
bastard!
Cut him down!
Drop your weapon!
Where's the boy?
Unarm yourself!
Where's the boy?
Why don't you show me the boy?
I came as you demanded.
Why don't you show me the boy?
The boy. Where is he?
Where did you hide the boy?
Where is he?
Xiaorong isn't here.
Why isn't he here?
Anybody, even a child, who obstructs
the procession is put to death.
That is the law.
But they promised
they would forgive him if I came.
Why did they break their promise?
A daimyo lord
must protect his authority.
A promise to you means nothing.
I honor a promise over a law.
But,
how do you know all this?
It was I who made the plan
to draw you out here.
Wang Kang, obey the law of Japan!
Kakuzen, how could you betray me?
I never imagined
you'd be just as corrupt!
Kill him!
Where is he?
Not there either?
Where did he go?
Look carefully.
Idiots! Open your eyes!
The bastard is blind.
He must be hiding around here.
Find him right now!
<i>'</i> Guys!
- Hurry!
Damn it!
Where is he?
Ow!
What are you doing?
It's just one blind bastard!
TobeL
Boss!
Move.
I'll fight you.
Die!
Zatoichi!
Are you all right?
You caused me a great deal of trouble.
A horrible man like you must not live.
Draw your sword.
This is not good.
I don't understand your words.
L...you...
don't want to fight.
You fight well, blind man.
No!
Stop! Stop it!
Stop it!
What a pity.
What a pity I had to kill such a man...
Now I know you are not a bad man.
If only we'd understood
each other's words...
If we'd understood each other's words...
we wouldn't have had to fight.
THE END
