"KYOTO UNIVERSITY, JAPAN"
Folks, Japan belongs to our people,
not the Emperor, nor the military.
Long live the people!
The Black Dragon Clan is coming.
Hurry up. Let's kick those
Chinese pigs out of the school.
Move.
Yes!
Now let me explain
the relationship between the gas tank
and the internal combustion engine.
Let's look at the design
of the internal combustion engine.
First, the gas is pumped to the carburetor.
Then it is mixed with air
in the combustion chamber
and burned in the internal
combustion engine.
What are you doing here?
You, Chinaman, get out!
How dare you do such a thing here!
Japanese school is for the Japanese,
not for the Chinese.
Take your war somewhere else!
You have no right to do this.
Get lost!
Are you all right?
Why are you doing this?
Bullying people doesn't make you a man.
Who are you?
How dare you speak to me like this?
I am Yamada Mitsuko. I am not afraid of you.
I look down on you.
Jerk!
Hey, I don't care who you are.
Get out of here immediately.
Now, when I count to three,
you better be gone.
One!
Two!
Three!
- Master.
- Master.
Master Funakoshi Fumio.
He is the head chief of
the Black Dragon Clan.
Oh, finished so soon?
Didn't I say that violence
couldn't solve the problem?
Does anybody doubt it now?
Professor Watanabe,
please accept my apology.
You should be grateful he was merciful,
or you'd be crippled.
Who did you fight with?
He fought with me.
Oh, who are you?
Your Kung Fu is quite good.
I am from the Black Dragon Clan,
Funakoshi Fumio.
And you are?
Mitsuko, why are you here?
Uncle Funakoshi,
my pen has been broken
by your apprentice.
You have to buy me a new one.
Oh, sweetheart,
you know your Uncle is very poor.
Does anybody have any money?
- Thanks.
- Here. Happy now?
You, young lady, make trouble
for your Uncle all the time.
Aren't you worried nobody
will marry you when you grow up?
Don't you worry about me.
Chen Zhen is all I need.
Chen Zhen?
Hello, I am Chen Zhen from Jing Wu Men.
Jing Wu Men of Shanghai?
Yes.
Then, Mr. Huo Yuan-jia--
Huo Yuan-jia is my master.
Really?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I just received a telegram
from Shanghai, China.
It says that Mr. Huo Yuan-jia's been killed
in a challenge match.
The opponent is Akutagawa Ryuichi,
from our Hong-Kou division
of the Black Dragon Clan.
This is impossible.
I am sorry.
It's true.
Excuse me, sir.
Master Huo's death
is a very great loss.
Chen Zhen.
Where are you going?
To Shanghai.
I have to find out what's
going on with my master.
It's impossible that your master's killer
was Japanese. It couldn't happen.
Stop the occupation of China.
Free Shanghai!
I warn you. If you’re gone too long,
I won't wait for you.
Chen Zhen.
Will you come back?
If they left China and came back to Japan,
I will come back for you.
But Japanese military in Qing Dao
is fighting with Germany.
You have to understand,
Qing Dao is Chinese territory.
Japan and Germany both are invaders.
Chen Zhen,
do you hate the Japanese?
I don't know.
Mitsuko, in this day and age,
you and I have no choice.
Please take care.
Chen Zhen.

"SHANGHAI "
Mister! Money! Money!
I don't have any.
Money! Money!
Sorry, I don't have any change.
Really, I don't have any.
- I tell you, I really don't have it.
- Go! Go away.
Good morning.
But I am not Japanese.
Sir, you aren't Japanese?
That's great.
Please have a seat.
- Sir, where do you want to go?
- Jing Wu Men.
Jing Wu Men?
Are you going to learn Kung Fu?
Yes. Can you please hurry up?
Learn Kung Fu?
You better not to go to Jing Wu Men.
Everybody in Shanghai knows
Jing Wu Men was number one before.
They are at the bottom now.
Do you want to go or not?
I can take another.
Yes. Go, go-- Let's go.
You pay me, of course
I will serve you. Hang on!
Hang on.
Let's go!
"JING WU MEN"
See, even Hua Yuan-jia is dead.
Jing Wu Men has no future.
Think about it; I can take you
to another Kung Fu school.
There is no future here.
Chen Zhen.
It's you.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
Are you...
Chen Zhen, from Jing Wu Men.
Jing Wu Men will have a bright future.
You'll see.
What? What are you waiting for?
- Chen Zhen.
- Chen Zhen.
Chen Zhen.
Master Ngai, this is my father's
mourning hall.
If you want to fight,
let's do it outside.
Master, are you all right?
Master Ngai, thank you
for your modest gesture.
Brother Huo, I am not as good as you.
My victory was just lucky.
You traveled a long way to get here.
You must be very tired.
Next time,
how about I pay you a visit?
You finished your schooling?
Anyway, you are home.
Uncle Nong.
I didn't want to interrupt your classes,
so I didn't tell you about him.
How did you know?
Even Japanese newspapers
have reported it.
Those Japanese must be satisfied now.
Oh, let's go kowtow
to my father first.
Come on.
Hold on. What is it?
Chen Zhen isn't Huo family.
How can you give him a mourning suit?
He is no different from us,
and is part of the Huo family.
- But--
- Please.
Before the match,
Dad's asthma was active.
I tried to talk him
out of it many times,
but he wouldn't listen to me.
"TOLERANCE"
Go ahead, kowtow.
Are you out of your mind?
That sign was written by your master.
- You...
- Uncle.
What Chen Zhen did is right.
The foreigners have been domineering
and tyrannical in China,
because we Chinese have
tolerated them for so long.
Mark my words.
As long as I, Ting-en,
am in Jing Wu Men,
I will tolerate this no more!
I am going to look for Jiechuan.
Chen Zhen, follow the rule;
you should send him a challenge proposal.
I'll go there now.
I don't need a challenge proposal.
- Chen Zhen.
- Chen Zhen.
Hong-Kou Arena belongs to the Japanese.
Even the police can do nothing with them.
What if something happens to you?
Have you thought about Jing Wu Men?
Your father couldn't even beat them.
- Uncle, I --
- Listen,
your father has asked
me to take care of you.
I cannot let you
to make a mistake.
Lun, Xiang, have some of our
people go with Chen Zhen.
If anything happens,
let me know immediately.
Yes. Follow me.
- Hello?
- I'm busy.
Whoa, nice card.
Get out! Get out!
Captain, there is a call for you.
Who is it?
Hello, this is Jie Yuankui.
What? Nong Jinsun?
Things are really that bad?
All right,
I am coming over now.
Move! Let's go to Hong-Kou Arena.
Two!
Three! Four!
You idiots. You act like girls.
Take a break.
Who are you? How dare you come in here
with your shoes on!
I am Chen Zhen from Jing Wu Men.
I am here for Akutagawa Ryuichi.
Chinese aren't allowed to come in here.
Get out!
This is the land of China,
and Chinese can go anywhere they want.
Go to hell!
I'm not interested in fighting with you.
Call your master here.
I am going to have
a fair match with Chen Zhen.
If anything should happen,
neither side is allowed to take revenge.
My master used our Huo Fist to fight you;
I will use the same.
I have seen very clearly now;
you could never win a match
against my master.
Master! Master!
No one is permitted
to enter the Hong-Kou Arena,
except for the Japanese.
Are you sure it's not a mistake?
Don't make trouble for me.
I saw with my own eyes
that Chen Zhen went in there.
Yeah, we saw it, too.
Look, Chen Zhen is coming.
Are you not Japanese?
I am not.
Salute!
What's going on?
Nothing, nothing.
Mr. Fujita, Mr. Ambassador,
just a misunderstanding.
You better not make a scene here.
Right.
Patrol one, go back.
Chen Zhen, how did it go?
I won.
Yeah! Great!
You two go tell Ting-en and Uncle Nong
and have them join me
at Master's graveside.
Okay, let's go.
- Master Huo's grave isn't finished yet.
- Even better.
Be careful, slower...
Yeah, right.
Pull.
It reeks.
Why does it smell so bad?
What are you doing?
Hey, what are they doing here?
An autopsy.
Why haven't you stopped them?
Brother Nong, Chen Zhen
is from Jing Wu Men.
I have no right to stop him.
But you...
Chen Zhen, how can you
mess with Dad's corpse?
I challenged Akutagawa,
and there's no way he could win at all.
I suspect Master was poisoned to death.
Jie Yuankui, do you suspect
Master Huo has been poisoned?
Huo Yuan-jia vomited blood
when Akutagawa hit him,
and a lot of people there saw that.
See?
Do you think we are all blind?
What?
Uncle Nong, I'd rather be
disrespectful and unfilial
in order to find out the truth.
If you want to stop me,
You'll have to kill me.
Ting-en, the--

Who the hell did it?
It's up to you to find out.
Come on, help here.
Let's put Master back to rest first.
Yes.
Like I said, Master couldn't
have been defeated by a Japanese.
Right, I dare those Japanese
to be cocky again.
That's right, Chen Zhen
came back just in time,
or we still would not know.
I don't understand.
How was Master poisoned?
Master had so many events out there,
and it would have been easy
for someone to poison him.
Do you remember?
During the match between
Master and Akutagawa,
Master meditated for an entire month.
He didn't go out socializing at all.
You are right.
Then the killer must be from Jing Wu Men.
What?
Xiao Hui.
Were you the one taking care
of Master's meals?
Yes. What's wrong?
Uncle Nong.
You don't suspect Xiao Hui, do you?
No.
I'm wondering-- who else besides Xiao Hui
had handled your father's food?
I do.
I take care of all of Jing Wu Men's food.
Do you suspect me?
Go check my kitchen to see
if there's anything poisonous. Go!
Uncle, please don't be mad.
mind your own business.
Go! Do you hear me?
Go check my kitchen
to see if there's anything poisonous.
Go, go.
Uncle, please don't be so mad.
If you don't check,
I could die inexplicably.
Ting-en, what's going on?
Uncle Nong is asking who poisoned Father,
and Uncle Gen thinks we suspect him.
I didn't say that I suspected him.
Good.
Then don't eat my cooking from now on.
I have been here for so many years.
Master Huo was raised on my cooking.
Nong Jingsun, how dare you
accuse me of poisoning him?
I didn't.
All right, all right, let's eat. Eat!
Chen Zhen, the food has been poisoned.
Master ate with us together.
If your food killed Master,
we would all be dead by now.
You have a good head on your shoulders.
Nong Jingsun, didn't you hear them?
They suspect me.
Uncle Gen, let's eat.
Well, those Japanese
may make trouble for us.
Let's finish our meals first.
Oh, let's eat.
Ting-en, I am going to go see Dr. Smith.
His detailed examination will show
which poison has been used.
Examination?
Yeah, chemical examination.
"Jing Wu Men"
Have you ever seen this kind
of Kung Fu training?
No.
That's great.
Awesome.
Can you do it?
No way.
Chen Zhen, I've never
seen you practice before.
Are you going to teach us the Huo Fist?
- Sure. Come on.
- Okay.
Come on.
Okay. Let's go.
Fancy moves may not be effective.
You must train hard while learning Kung Fu.
There is only one goal during a fight--
that's to defeat the opponent.
This requires reaction, speed, and power.
Actually, the simplest attack
works the best.
If you want to fight somebody,
First you have to learn to take the hits.
That's not true.
We have to beat them down
before their First move.
If you don't have a powerful punch,
even if you've punched him ten times,
he'd still be all right.
He hits you with one big punch.
You won't be able to take it, and you fail.
Sister, they've both come here
to learn Kung Fu.
Can I ask if Master Chen Zhen
would teach us Kung Fu?
Yes, we want to learn
from Master Chen Zhen.
The head master of Jing Wu Men
is Huo Ting-en.
I cannot guarantee
that Chen Zhen will teach you.
You can leave if you aren't interested.
What form is that?
Four-legged form.
Four-legged form?
Why does it look like a dead horse?
Show me a kick.
A kick like that would
not have enough power.
There's a side-kick
in Japanese martial arts.
- It's simple--
- Go on.
... but it's quite speedy and powerful.
Chen Zhen, show us.
Yes, show us.
Good, let's do it.
Come on; be ready.
All right, let's do it.
Yes, come on.
Really powerful.
Are you all right?
- He is all right.
- Good, beautiful.
You have to focus the power
from your entire body
and kick sharply with the flow.
Got it.
"XIAO HONG"
What do you want?
Don't go.
It's getting late.
I want you to stay.
I am the head master now;
I must go back there.
When your dad was alive,
you said you didn't dare to stay overnight.
Now you are the head.
What are you afraid of?
If somebody saw me staying here,
they wouldn't listen to me anymore.
I don't believe you.
Who would dare to rebel against my Ting-en?
Please stay.
Can you?
I have to take off before dawn.
I need to know every move
these people make.
Why do you monitor the Japanese?
There are always some idiots
who ignore things as they are.
Sorry.
I am late.
Mr. Akutagawa, are you out of your mind
because you're afraid of Chen Zhen?
You don't even know how to knock on a door?
I wanted you to rest
instead of attending the meeting.
I only want to ask one thing:
Whether our military chief officer
has heard
about the autopsy of Huo Yuan-jia.
All of you can get out now.
Yes.
What is it? What is the secret?
What?
Are you the one
who had others poison him?
The Japanese Empire of today,
in terms of economy, technology,
industry, and military strength,
is far more advanced than China.
We hoped that your warriors
would destroy the Legendary Fist
of Chinese Kung Fu.
Too bad. You all have disappointed us.
We stepped in because
we were compelled to do so.
Shame on you!
There can never be too much
deception in war.
This suits you military people,
but it doesn't suit us warriors.
That match between Huo Yuan-jia and me
should've been open and above board.
Unfortunately it's been spoilt
by you, dirty jerk.
You are not worthy of the spirit of Samurai!
Let me tell you what it means
to be a Samurai.
To best serve the Japanese emperor,
you'd better forget what is right or wrong.
Even if you'll go down in history
as a criminal,
you still refuse to reconsider your actions.
Your way isn't right.
Let me show you how to do it right.
Uncle Nong,
according to Dr. Smith's results,
the late master was overdosed
with a poison that damaged his lungs.
When he fought with Akutagawa,
he couldn't take a heavy strike.
Do you think there is a traitor
here at Jing Wu Men?
Chen Zhen, why did you really come back?
Uncle Nong, what do you mean?
You've been back only two days,
and the fellows of Jing Wu Men
have seen you as their idol,
but have you ever considered...
Ting-en's feelings?
About what?
Everything you've done
since the day you came here
you never consulted with Ting-en beforehand;
you just made your own decision.
Have you ever taken him seriously?
You are very talented.
Please remember,
Ting-en is now the only master
at Jing Wu Men.
It's late. I'm going.
Take your time to think about it.
Chen Zhen, are you going jogging?
Yeah.
Such a hard worker!
Master Chen.
Master Chen, you are jogging so early.
Look, all of my friends have come.
Master Chen! Master Chen!
They want to learn Kung Fu from you.
Please don't follow me.
Please don't.
Master Chen!
We got up late.
Master.
Master Akutagawa is dead!
"NATURAL JUSTICE DOESN'T
ACCOMMODATE THE MURDERER--
CHEN ZHEN"
Hold on.
Stop. We cannot solve
the problem with violence.
General.
Let's go.
Morning, Master.
Where were you last night?
Why didn't you come home?
Where is Chen Zhen?
He went jogging.
Let me know when he comes back.
I'm going to my room.
Everyone, the Japanese are coming
and they're mad as hell!
Hurry up. Come on.
Master.
- The Japanese!
- Calm down.
Something is wrong.
Go ask the police for help.
What's the matter?
Where is Chen Zhen?
Chen Zhen? I don't know where he is.
He could possibly
be out beating up the Japanese.
My brother's a Little weird.
He feels uncomfortable
if he doesn't hit a Japanese every day.
Hold on.
Shame on the Chinese people.
You murdered our Master Akutagawa.
You are who you are-- Japanese.
The evil person complains first.
Bullshit.
If you don't turn Chen Zhen in today,
we won't leave.
You've come here well prepared.
I realize you won't leave.
Close the door!
Protect our late master's shrine!
Hurry up!
Shoot the Japanese!
We are here to stop the fight.
Put your swords away.
All right. You'd better leave now.
What?
They can't be let off the hook.
Nobody's injured; I say let it go.
We won't leave.
We want Chen Zhen.
Sakamoto, would you like
to take my suggestion?
Ah, you don't matter.
Chen Zhen.
Don't move!
Old man, I dare you to shoot me.
I would dare,
but I am afraid the gun would misfire.
I will shoot whoever moves.
Take Chen Zhen
back to the police station.
Let's go.
Why do you take Chen Zhen?
Akutagawa was killed yesterday.
I need to take Chen Zhen back
for investigation.
I didn't kill him. Not me.
Take him. Go!
Back off! Back off!
I'll shoot if you don't back off!
this way. Come on. Sit down.
Please sit down.
Please don't worry.
Mr. Jie is in charge of this case.
He said everything would be fine.
Why are you wearing that uniform?
I'm sorry, Nong;
I was transferred out of the department.
This case is no longer under my jurisdiction.
What? But Chen Zhen...
Fate will lead him.
Hey! Hey! Come back!
Order!
Captain, you said you have witnesses.
How many witnesses do you have?
Yes. We have four witnesses.
They have claimed they witnessed
Chen Zhen commit the murder.
Liar!
Where did they find
those four witnesses?
I saw Chen Zhen in person.
All of us knew it was him.
I saw him stab the Japanese man
to death with a knife.
He was using a big knife.
You're sure it's him? Are you sure?
It's him.
I am sure. It's him.
Can you tell me,
how many fingers do you see?
Nine?
No, no.
Six?
Why don't you move closer
so I can see clearly?
Never mind.
They are trash.
They are not trustworthy.
I didn't kill anyone.
I was at Jing Wu Men at the time.
My students and friends
can testify for me.
Your Honor,
I think that the friends of Jing Wu Men
and Chen Zhen are brothers,
so they don't qualify to be witnesses.
What are you talking about?
That doesn't make sense.
your Honor, I have a reliable witness.
your Honor, I don't think
a Chinese witness is trustworthy.
My witness is Japanese.
Japanese?
Okay.
Miss, please identify yourself.
My name is Yamada Mitsuko.
My father is the minister
of Japanese Education.
According to what Chen Zhen said,
he was at Jing Wu Men all night long.
Miss Yamada, do you agree
with his testimony?
Chen Zhen is lying.
That night, he was in
my hotel room all night.
He never went out at all.
The entire night?
Yes.
What if Chen Zhen snuck out
while you were asleep?
How would you have known?
That's not possible.
We were both in bed,
but we didn't sleep the entire night.
If you didn't sleep,
what were you doing then?
We didn't sleep. You tell me,
What else can we do
if we are lying awake in bed?
Hey, what did she say?
I have no idea. Do you?
She said Chen Zhen slept with her.
Really? Are you sure?
Congratulations!
Let's go!
Let's go!
The national hero
is nothing but a sex fiend.
How did you get here?
I have given up everything.
You have to take care of me forever.
Cook for her?
No way! Don't even think about it!
Go back to Japan!
Chen Zhen, your master
sent you to Japan
to learn new Japanese technology.
Knowing yourself and your opponents,
you will know how to deal with Japanese.
Don't forget Master's wish
because of a Japanese woman.
At Jing Wu Men,
we don't want any misunderstanding
that we have a deal with the Japanese.
Chen Zhen, you belong to Jing Wu Men.
You shouldn't be
with a Japanese woman.
Chen Zhen, have I made a lot of trouble
for you since I've been here?
No.
Chen Zhen, a man shouldn't worry
about getting a wife.
Once you indulge yourself in a crazy
affair, you will lose the status of hero.
Do you really want to ruin your life
just for a woman?
Uncle Nong, Mitsuko has come here
and given up everything just for me.
She even lied in court.
How can I leave her now?
Maybe Japanese women
always behave like sluts.
According to the rules of Jing Wu Men,
it's impossible to allow
a Japanese woman to stay here.
You choose.
Either you break up with her,
or you shall leave Jing Wu Men.
Master, clearly you want to kick
Chen Zhen out of here.
What did you just say, Liu Zhensheng?
Seems you’re  siding
with the Japanese, aren't you?
- What? Don't bullshit me.
- What bullshit?
Look at you.
You are more and more like a traitor.
If you say it again, I will beat you to hell.
You both quit fighting.
All of you, shut up!
Chen Zhen, if you insist
on acting this way,
Jing Wu Men is soon going to break down.
I have don't have the heart
for any more internal conflicts.
It would seem you and I are in a battle
for the leadership position.
I never think about being head master.
I don't care what you have thought.
As a matter of fact, most of them
would rather listen to you than me.
I want to fight you.
If I lose, you will be
the head master of Jing Wu Men.
If you lose, you shall break up
with her immediately.
Master, take him down.
We don't want a Japanese woman
at Jing Wu Men.
Stop saying that.
Master, kick him out of here.
Master. Master.
Master, are you all right?
Are you all right?
Is everything all right?
I lost.
You are now the head master here.
- Master.
- Master.
I don't want to be the head master.
I will not leave Mitsuko.
If you want me to make a choice,
I choose to leave Jing Wu Men.
Do you really want to go back
to Shandong province?
It's a mess there. My mother is ill.
Mitsuko, you wait for me right here.
- Hi there. Do you have a room available?
- Yes, we have. Please, allow me.
Come here. They have a room.
She's Japanese?
I don't have a room for Japanese.
She is my wife.
Can you please make an exception?
- Is that Chen Zhen?
- Chen Zhen from Jing Wu Men?
He is a lascivious traitor.
Go away. Leave!
Go! We don't want you to stay.
You better leave now.
Please don't mess up my business.
Just go, please.
Chen Zhen, let's leave.
" HUO YUAN-JIA'S GRAVE"
- Mouse! There is a mouse!
- Where?
There! Over there!
A mouse?
Where is it?
It was here just now. Really.
Maybe it's gone.
A place like this-- Of course
mice are running around.
Oh, I am scared of that mouse.
It irritates me.
Actually, the mouse lived here first,
and then we came here to irritate them.
Well, maybe you are right.
Sorry. I feel so bad
forcing you to stay in such a place.
I feel this is a good place.
Look. The view outside is so pretty.
And it's actually nicer than a hotel.
Why don't we do this?
I will take you to another place.
Are you really going
to give up Jing Wu Men?
Jing Wu Men gave up on me.
Suddenly, since Jing Wu Men,
I feel more relaxed.
This is not you.
Why?
You are lying to yourself.
You would feel alone without Jing Wu Men.
How would you relax?
Chen Zhen is a liar.
Mitsuko knows.
Do you?
Please have a cup of tea, Uncle Nong.
Okay. Thank you. Why don't you eat?
I have no appetite.
Hasn't Ting-en come back yet?
This must be hard for him. Ting-en has
never had a setback since he was little.
It's really hard to face
that he lost to Chen Zhen.
Master is very stubborn.
I'm afraid he isn't coming back
to be our head master.
If he doesn't, who else could take over?
The Mizong Fist of Huo
is never passed on except to family.
If he won't take it over,
who is going to inherit
the Mizong Fist and keep it up?
Well, who has been teaching
Kung Fu recently?
Xiang and Biao.
If anyone came to challenge us now,
what are we supposed to do?
My mother wrote in a letter
that Jing Wu Men offended the Japanese.
She asked me to leave.
What? Are you going to leave?
I don't know what to do.
Don't worry; we are in British territory.
The Japanese should behave better, right?
You Chinese really are wasteful.
One table of people
are eating two tables of food.
What's going on?
I want to meet Jing Wu Men's head master.
It isn't up to you who you can meet.
You can tell me what you want.
The number one warrior of our
Black Dragon Clan, Mr. Fumio Funakoshi,
proposes to challenge your head master.
- What do we do?
- We need to find our master.
Useless!
I say we get Chen Zhen back.
I know where he is.
You want that traitor to fight the Japanese?
Hey, stop talking bullshit here.
He is a traitor.
Stop. Enough is enough.
All you do is just argue and fight.
Go find Master and bring him back.
Go! Hurry up!
- Uncle Gen.
- Uncle Gen.
A Xiang.
Where did Master go?
How could I know?
What's going on, Uncle Gen?
Stop pretending.
What's going on with my son?
Let's talk about it tonight.
You told me you would release
my son if I poisoned him.
Your son has committed a murder
in Shandong province.
It's not that simple.
But you promised me.
I didn't promise you.
The Japanese promised you.
My daughter-in-law said
that my son was killed
by the Japanese in prison.
Let me tell you something.
You have already done it,
and you didn't do it for nothing.
You got the money.
You didn't hesitate
when you took the money.
If the Japanese made you a promise,
your son should be fine.
Don't bark about it anymore.
You guys said those drugs
wouldn't kill Master Huo.
If I knew things were
going to go so wrong,
I would've let my son die
rather than Master Huo.
"Jing Wu Men"
Help! Help!
What happened?
Go find more people! We need help!
Let's get him down! Come on!
We found this under his body.
What is it?
It's crocodile meat that Ting-en asked
to be brought back from Singapore.
It's for curing asthma.
Oh, hey!
In Jing Wu Men,
only Master Huo ate this meat.
Oh, yeah?
It looks like he killed Master Huo
with poisoned crocodile meat,
then committed suicide
because he felt guilty.
Hey, since he's dead,
please keep quiet about this.
It would ruin our reputation,
if people knew we had a rat here.
Jing Wu Men is going down
whether there is a rat or not.
Chen Zhen has left,
and Ting-en has vanished as well.
I say, you better find someone new
to take over as head master soon.
Jing Wu Men has gone down over this.
I don't know how to face
the late Master Huo.
Captain, what should we do now?
You are leading the team today.
Why do you ask me?
Please instruct me, Captain.
Take the crocodile meat for testing.
We are leaving. Let's go.
Can you please try
to find Ting-en again?
All right. Take it easy.
Miss, could you please tell me
who you are looking for?
M y I ask if Nong Jinsun--
Uncle Nong is here?
Yes. Please follow me.
Uncle Nong, this lady is here for you.
You are?
Uncle Nong, Ting-en is at my place.
I've tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't come back.
I think maybe only you could convince him.
Where do you live?
Can you please take me there?
Dizzy Star House.
Is it a brothel?
How long have you known Ting-en?
Two years.
He must have spent a fortune on you.
Please don't worry. I will leave him.
Uncle Nong,
please don't misunderstand.
Ting-en isn't as bad as you think.
As a matter of fact,
he wants to rally Jing Wu Men.
He even told me
he could make it better than his dad.
It's true.
Uncle Nong, please help him.
Go away! I want to kick them!
Let go of me!
Master.
Sheng, Biao, let's go home.
Since you've come here,
is there anything wrong
with Jing Wu Men?
Hong-Kou Arena has proposed
to challenge Jing Wu Men.
I want you to come back
and discuss it with me.
What about Chen Zhen?
People wouldn't appreciate it
if it's Chen Zhen.
You are the head master.
Well, never mind. Let's go home.
Wait!
I will go back with you.
Are you confident to take the challenge?
Even if I lost, I wouldn't let others
look down on Jing Wu Men.
Hold on.
What will you do with her?
Do you really want to leave her there?
You aren't fair to her.
- Lun, go get the Madam.
- Okay.
I want you to ransom her out of there.
Xiao Hong, are you ready
to give up those pretty clothes?
I am so happy I can dress like you.
This outfit seems a bit small on you.
- I'll find another one for you tomorrow.
- I've checked.
Fumio Funakoshi isn't only the number one
warrior of the Black Dragon Clan,
but also the number one in Japan.
But don't you worry. He's getting old.
- Uncle Nong.
- Uncle Nong.
She looks very good, doesn't she?
Oh, right. Now you can use
your maiden name-- Sulan.
Good.
If you could both keep
open minds toward Mitsuko,
that's even better.
That's different. Mitsuko is Japanese.
Ting-en, only ten days
to the challenge match.
Please practice.
- Thanks! Biao, come here.
- Coming.
Take these back inside.
You are taking such good care of Ting-en.
I take care of everyone.
Is Ting-en the best at Jing Wu Men?
Yes.
What about Chen Zhen?
They both are the same, equally good.
Master, I am sorry.
- Are you all right, Master?
- I am fine.
Come on. Let's do it again.
What's in Master's mind?
Why is he scared?
"BLACK DRAGON CLAN"
Mr. Funakoshi, I've delivered
your challenge proposal to Jing Wu Men.
I want you to understand one thing.
Who I challenge to Kung Fu and what I do
is no business of the military.
Allow me to remind you,
all of the expenses
of Black Dragon Clan in China
are paid by our military.
It doesn't matter.
You can cut back
Black Dragon Clan's budget from now on.
I don't think the chairman,
Mr. Oshima, will agree with you.
Don't threaten me
with the chairman's name.
I am just a head master in martial arts.
I am not a politician.
"CHALLENGE PROPOSAL"
You are up so early.
Good morning.
Mr. Funakoshi?
Uncle Funakoshi?
Mitsuko, how do you live
so far away from town?
I'd have hired a carriage if I'd known.
Has my father sent you here?
Your father is very busy,
and I haven't seen you for a long time.
Why are you here, then?
It's for him.
Chen Zhen?
Have you two married yet?
Not yet.
Aren't you two living together?
We want to get married,
but neither the Chinese
nor the Japanese would approve of it.
Luckily you haven't married yet.
If I kill him, at least you won't be a widow.
What did you just say?
If you are the one who ends up dead,
I will take your ashes back to Japan.
Kid, are you really that confident?
What? The two of you are going
to have a match?
Chen Zhen, why didn't you tell me earlier?
Men don't have to tell women everything.
Chen Zhen, this way.
Tell me, what is the most powerful punch?
It's about focusing the body's energy
to one single point, that's all.
That's really powerful.
But I've never seen a rock
that would hit a Human being.
How can you give a name
to the most powerful punch?
Whatever you say.
Shall we try it now?
So tell me, what is the best defense?
It's offense.
It's better to use the energy to attack
rather than waste it to defend,
and to punch the opponent powerfully
in the shortest amount of time.
According to what you said,
the Huo Fist is the same as karate.
They are both the hard core styles.
Aren't you just saying it
but not understanding it?
Energy is wasted
if there is no softness in the hardness,
and attack is ineffectual
without hardness in the softness.
Power cannot exist without both elements.
Sir, what have you taught your disciples?
Has your master ever taught you
about controlling your anger in a match?
Kid, you are going to suffer a loss
if you act like this.
My master never talked too much,
like you do.
Are we ready to go?
Wait!
Hold it.
An old man like me needs to warm up.
What style is that?
Whatever. It's a good one if it wins.
Are you all right?
I am fine.
I won't take advantage of you.
We shall stop.
Are you all right?
A young man as skilful and talented
as you are is very rare.
It's astonishing for an older person like you
to have such power.
I've heard that the Chinese have a saying--
The fist fears the strength of youth.
It's very true.
Thank you.
But I lost.
I adapted to your theory of combat.
Chinese martial arts
always emphasizes self-discipline
rather than strength.
You've broadened my views.
The objective of a match
is to conquer your opponent.
Wrong, young man;
the best way to conquer
an opponent is to use a gun.
The ultimate goal of martial arts
is to maximize one's energy.
If you want to achieve this ultimate goal,
you need to understand
the soul of the universe.
I must go. Take care.
Weren't we contending in a match?
Only animals fight.
We are at a draw.
However, I cannot represent
all of the Japanese.
There are so many
excellent warriors in Japan.
Mr. Funakoshi, aren't you
the number one warrior in Japan?
Everyone says Mr. Funakoshi is the best.
What that means is his self-discipline
and dignity are supreme,
rather than his expertise in killing.
Mr. Huo Yuan-jia,
I didn't expect you to have
such a good disciple.
The best at the Hong-Kou Arena now
is the so-called killing machine,
Fujita Gou.
young man, you take care.
There.
Hey, you lost.
I am impressed that your chess skills
have improved so much.
Too bad life can't be manipulated
as easily as a chess game.
A few years ago,
Dr. Sun Yixian was
the Black Dragon Clan's best friend.
Today Black Dragon is rotten.
It's more and more like the military,
and they want to conquer China.
Conquer China?
Those idiots are just imagining things.
They aren't just imagining things.
The number of Japanese troops in China
is currently more than half
of Japan's domestic military strength.
I'm aware of this information,
but Japan's situation now
is like a very strong ant
that wants to bite a sleeping elephant.
While the elephant is asleep,
the ant has an advantage.
As soon as the elephant
is woken up by the sore,
even the strongest ant cannot win.
However, I think China,
the elephant, is still asleep.
There is more than one ant
aiming to bite it.
He will wake up!
Right. Too bad...
Most of the Japanese won't believe you.
In past decades,
Japan has made huge profits
from every war,
and Japan has the ambition
to become a big empire.
Just look at General Fujita.
There are far too many like him.
With things being the way they are,
war is unavoidable.
You are back!
How are you?
- Is Chen Zhen around?
- He isn't back yet.
Please have a seat.
Please have a cup of tea.
Thank you.
Are you happy here?
We are.
That's good.
Oh, Chen Zhen. Look, it's Ting-en.
How's it going? What've you been up to?
I've got a job in the telegram bureau.
And Jing Wu Men?
What about it?
I miss it, but...
as you can see, I have a new life.
How about coming back to Jing Wu Men?
Xiao Hong, she has moved in.
From the Dizzy Star House?
It's working out.
Good.
You can bring Mitsuko back as well.
They are willing to accept Shen Han,
but not Mitsuko.
Because she is Japanese.
She means a lot to you.
She is a good woman.
Not everyone believes that.
If I were to bring her there,
it would cause too much trouble.
I cannot be selfish.
I learned a new style.
What is it?
I'll show you.
This is the same as the Hua style.
Yes. The Hua Fist method.
But Master said
it's only for the Hua Clan.
That was true,
but now things are different.
The whole school has to learn it.
Chen Zhen, listen;
tomorrow I fight a Noguchi.
If anything happens to me,
teach the style to the others.
The more people who learn it, the better.
My dear Chen Zhen,
I have decided to return home.
There are things in life
more important than love,
and I think my being with You
is hurting Your cause.
Fulfill your promise,
and when the soldiers return to Japan,
I will be waiting for you in Kyoto.
Lun will come with me.
Ting-en, I'm worried;
maybe you should bring
more men with you.
There's nothing to worry about.
They know the rules.
Only two men can fight.
Yes, that's right.
Sha-Wei, take care of her, please.
Wait. Hang on.
I'll go with you, if you want.
Let's go.
Good. How about those two?
Together again.
Sensei Funakoshi left Shanghai
early this morning.
He is a stubborn old fool.
With or without him, the fight goes on.
I will deal with him another time.
Yes.
General, then we are still
going to fight Jing Wu Men?
Yes. We can't rely
on Funakoshi for everything.
I'm going to personally handle this matter.
Yes.
So, you've accepted.
That's good.
First, though,
I have something you should see.
I have Master Hua's murderer.
Come here!
Mr. Chan accepted a bribe.
He and the cook soaked
the bark of the gingko in poison.
He's the one who betrayed Jing Wu Men.
It's over. Take him away.
Move your men out. Move them out.
Yes, sir.
All right. Everyone out.
"JING WU MEN IS CLOSED"
You'll get your chance to keep the gates
open and destroy the sign if you defeat me.
Take it.
- Can you walk?
- Yes.
Halt!
Dead.
General.
Ambassador, the general, he's dead.
Police. Don't move, or I will shoot.
Take it easy. Are you all right?
I am fine.
Freeze.
You are on the Japanese compound.
You cannot enforce the law here!
I am not a police officer.
I am a Chinese man, you jerk.
These men are Chinese,
and they're in our custody.
What are you talking about?
I order you to turn them over!
- Don't move!
- Freeze!
Now we'll see who gives
the orders in my country.
Stop it!
Everyone hold your fire!
Now, then, this argument
will be solved in a peaceful manner.
General Fujita is dead,
but there will be no more lost lives.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!
Remove your platoon!
But, sir!
I'm the one that's in charge now.
Understand?
You will all do as you're ordered.
Yes, sir.
Company, move out!
Captain,
our Japanese general is dead.
I must know who killed him.
Someone will be held responsible;
otherwise, the military won't let it go.
You need a scapegoat to prevent
our countries from going to war.
All right, I'm going to be that man.
No. He can't do that.
China will be in your debt.
Let us in!
Tell us what happened!
This person looks like Chen Zhen.
Have they really killed Chen Zhen?
"SEALED BY THE COMMAND OF"
"THE SHANGAHl
FOREIGN DISTRICT BUREAU"
What did I tell you?
I knew the Japanese forces--
But lives were lost this time.
It's terrible.
You know that Japanese soldiers
are responsible for this.
- They gang up to bully our Chinese people.
- Right. They do.
Chen Zhen was truly a hero.
Let me tell you.
He took on the Noguchi warriors,
and he beat them all.
I know. I saw it myself.
Ah. Then the soldiers shot him.
What's wrong? Who is it?
No one. No one. Go on.
I can't believe you have to leave Shanghai
and start all over.
Are you going to be with Mitsuko?
If I no longer have a country,
at least I can be with the woman I love.
Jing Wu Men didn't vanish afterwards;
they expanded all over China;
they even expanded to Singapore.
As for Chen Zhen, he is unaccounted for.
