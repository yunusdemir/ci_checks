Sorry, pal.
The exact time is 16.44...
...and as you can plainly see,
the subject of Retroactive Experiment No. 12
is plainly deceased.
Since my first 11 attempts at this experiment
proved unsuccessful,
this will be my last opportunity,
as the idiots at the Pentagon shut
this place down on Vonday morning.
This tape proves that I was able
to briefly reverse the flow of time.
Any subject passing through this machine
will have total recollection of what happened.
I, however, will have
no memory of these events.

Now this tape proves,
not only to my detractors, but also to myself.
- I did it.
- Because if I am right,
and I can briefly reverse the flow of time,
- Whoa.
- I will have no memory of these events.
I did it.
I did it.
Oh, my Cod. Oh, my Cod.

You have yourself a cup of coffee.
By the time youre done with it,
llI be back with the cash.
Yeah!

at the Federal Building.
Negotiator Karen Warren has resigned
from her position with the Police Department.
Argh!
Ah!
Stop! Hey!
Thank s a bunch, pal.
Not goood

Vy car. Look s like I may need a little help.
What the hell happened to that sign?
Thats Rayanne. Dont mind her, shes just shy.
Yeah, look s like you got a problem.
In this general area right here.
- Any particular type of problem, do you think?
- Hell, I dont know.
I could take you up the road
to my buddy whos got a tow truck.
Hell, come on.
Franks the name. Throw yourself in the rear.
Ill fix you up. Isnt that right, Rayanne?
Whatever you want, Frank.
Hi, Im Karen. How far do you suppose it is?
Oh, I dont know. Let me think now.
Id say five, ten miles.
Hell, who knows? This is Texas, right?
Are you from these parts?
Yeah, used to be.
Down by Calveston way.
Is that right?
You sure talk like a city girl.
Rayanne, polish these for me.
Ha! The funniest thing happened to me today.
I was in the break room having coffee
and there was this woman, Kim.
Shes some kinda secretary.
She says, she goes like this,
Frank, thats a good-looking belt buckle.
And I... This just popped into my head,
dont ask me how,
I said to her... Cuess what I said.
Cuess what I say to her.
Somebody, please, guess what I said.
So what did you say?
I say, Well, itd look a lot better
pressed against your forehead.
That just popped into my head.
Dont want to experience
my razor-sharp wit back there?
I guess Ive been away too long.
Viss that Texas humour.
Hell, I know whatll cheer you up.
Like country music?
- No, not really.
- What?
Thats one reason I left Texas.
Its made in America for Americans.
Not un-American, are ya?
No. You might say that dealing with Americans
is what Im trained to do.
Dont tell me youre a cop, dont.
Close. Psychologist.
Shrink, huh?
Well, all right!
I got an assignment for you.
Whats there in that book of yours?
If you really wanna know,
its a framework to work out what youd do
if you could go back and change your life.
Sounds like bullshit to me,
if you dont mind me saying.
- Its just therapeutic role-playing.
- Like me play Tarzan, you Jane?
Shit! Where the hell you suppose
he popped up from? Coddammit!
Bullshit!
Already got three goddamn tickets.
Vy insurance is gonna go sky high.
Whoa! Stay right where you are.
I didnt ask you to get out of the car.
Hey, Officer, just stretching my legs.
No crime in that, is there?
I want to see your licence and registration.
Yes, sir.
Tell me one thing first.
What in the hell did I do wrong?
You were doing 78 mph in a 55-mile zone
is what the hell you were doing wrong.
Come on! Really?
I can assure you, Officer,
that would be highly unusual for me.
- Im like this with the law.
- Cive me your licence and registration.
Yes, sir.
Coddamn bitch shrank my jeans.
There you go, sir.
Conna tell me who you got with you?
- Them two is my women.
- Bigamy is against the law.
Well... thats why I aint married.
Keeping it legal.
Just get back in your car.
Yes, sir. Not a problem there.
Just sit back behind the wheel.
Therell be a slight delay
while the good officer clears matters up.
Vaybe I should get a ride from the trooper,
get outta your hair.
No, I wouldnt hear of it. You just hold on.
Hell!
Only got about a mile to go.
Well, except for six previous speeding violations,
it seems you are a law-abiding citizen, Vr Loyd.
Well, I told you.
So Im just gonna write ya up for 70.
Sign by that X.
Slow down.
Cause llI be watching you.
Fuck you very much, sir.
Asshole!
- Honey...
- Shut up!
You just keep your eyes on this, asshole.
Look out!
I coulda knocked that son of a bitch
all the way back to Chihuahua.
So, baby?
What the hell are you tense about?
Come on, lighten up, Rayanne.
Say something.
Come on, our guests gonna think
youre damned mute
if you dont say something.
OK.
Co on.
I just wish you would control your temper.
- Bullshit! Thats bullshit.
- You wanted me to say something.
The first thing that comes outta your mouth
is a criticism of me. Is that it?
- No...
- Aw, shut up, woman!
Coddamn women!
Ha! Cant live with em,
cant blow their heads off.
Shit.
Well, this must be it, huh?
Nope, not yet. Im just stopping here
for a well-deserved beverage.
Damn! Lm as thirsty
as a chipmunk hung out to dry.
Hey! You girls wanna dab in a little beverage?
Not for me.
Well, cant say I didnt try.
Dont want you yapping behind my back now.
Damn, its good to be in America!
- Wake up, Sam!
- Hey, Frank.
The man is here.
- Hows it going?
- Coddamn winds raging.
So hes gotta come here and get his beer.
You like Australian beer? He always gets that.
It reminds him of his dad.
He took off for Australia
and left him when he was ten.
Rayanne, you dont have to stay with him.
Sometimes I wanna take a knife
and cut his heart out.
Honey, you dont wanna do something like that.
Im gonna give you the number
of a womens shelter. Call em any time.
They can help you out, OK?
Yeah.
This is the mother lode.
Dont know what these things do,
but they sure pay for em.
I cant even programme my VCR!
You may wanna use that phone.
Here.
Take care of yourself, Rayanne, huh?
Dont you worry about me. Ill be fine.
- There you go.
- Cimme that!
Damn, thats more cash than Ive ever seen!
Thank s for the ride.
Freeze!
Say, do you know where
we could find a place to camp around here?
Sorry. Im not from around here.

- Ten miles?
Creat. Thank s.
Bye-bye.
Im going to Vexico with Rayanne.
I hope it work s out. You watch that water.
- They say that waters rough.
- Hey, Frank!
- Cive you the shits, that water in Vexico.
- Frank, come here.
Remember that guy I told you about?
He gave me these.
Bullshit.
Its bullshit, Sam.
- You showed these to anybody else?
- No, Frank, no, thats your girl.
Bullshit! You showed these to anybody?
- No. I...
- Thats bullshit!
I dropped my wallet.
Did you show anyone else those photographs?
Ah, dammit!
Enjoy your beer.
Enjoy your beer. Dont worry about it, asshole!
What the hell...?
Frank! Frank? What are you doing?
Rayanne, throw me a beer, would ya?
Frank, would you stop, please?
I was getting out there.
Frank, theres a tow truck there.
Vaybe you didnt realise.
Damn!
Will somebody please tell me
why women can change their minds
whenever the mood strikes? Huh?
We all have moments
where we rethink choices, Frank.
- Its natural.
- Natural!
A natural pain in the ass.
You want a little beer?
Rayanne?
- Are you sure you dont want a beer?
- Yes.
Yo odo waht a boeoer?
No
See? Thats what I mean.
Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.
Do you or do you not
want a goddamn beer?
No, I dont want one of your goddamn beers,
so shut the hell up and leave me alone!
Drink it.
Drink it. Drink it!
Drink it, drink it, drink it!
- Leave me alone!
- llI leave you alone.
Frank, where are we going?
See, Karen, my wife Rayanne,
she seems to think
that Im one of those
bad-to-the-bone unrepentant assholes.
I think she brings it out in me.
What do you think?
Seems that you two can work it out.
Is that what you think? Lts too late for that.
Way too late for that.
Khow how
...itll never work out.
No.
Cause you see...
...Ive had a sudden unforeseen realisation
that has left me saddened...
...and terribly hurt.
What are you talking about, Frank?
It occurred to me back there
that Id seen that pickup truck before.
M ayboe, Rayahhoe, hmayboe
...you might understand this.
No, Frank.
Come on, Rayanne!
This is Frank. You can tell me the truth.
Tell me.
Youre always lying to me!
Sam was thoughtful enough
to show me some photographs of you.
I was shocked.
Ive never seen you like that before.
I dont know what you mean, Frank.
Talking about the fuckin beaner
youve been fucking!
Thats what Im talking about!
Hes gonna kill me!
- Frank, look at me.
- No, shes right.
I am gonna kill her. Shits what it is.
Frank, talk to me.
Turn around and talk about this.
No, baby
Frank, we can work this out.
Youre a big guy. You dont need a gun.
Frank, put the gun down.
No!
Argh! Oh!
Oh! Oh, no!
Open the door!
Here we go.
Shit!
Oh, my Cod! Thank Cod.
- The door, is it locked?
- Uh, yeah. It lock s automatically.
Are you sure? Well, is it bulletproof?
- Uh... I suppose so.
- We have to call the police.
This man, he just shot his wife.
- Relax. Nobody can get through that door...
- You dont understand.
- Hes a killer and hes after me.
- Just relax.
- Youre hurt. Let me clean that cut.
- No, listen.

She sees my belt buckle, right?
She says, she goes like this,
Frank, thats a good-looking belt buckle.
I... I dont know, this just popped into my head,
dont ask me how,
I said to her...
Cuess what I said.
Somebody guess what I said!
Frank, what did you say?
I said,
Itd look better
with your forehead pressed against it.
You dont want to experience
my razor-sharp wit back there?
llI just listen to a little music.
- Do you like...
- No, I hate country music.
How can you hate country music?
I just do.
Whats in that book?
Psychotherapy.
Is that right?
Lts a framework for what you might do
if you could change your life.
I know you think its bullshit...
- You took the words right outta my mouth.
... but its not.
Its therapeutic role-playing.
- You like that role-playing thing?
- Yeah. Just like Tarzan and Jane. Right?
You and I are connecting.
You are reading my mind, girl.
And youre driving just a little too fast
for your own good.
- I bet it feels like 55.
- Yeah, it feels like it.
- It wont seem like it to that cop.
- What cop?
Shit, why didnt you tell me?
damn son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Already got three tickets.
Vy insurance is gonna go sky high.
Whoa, whoa. Stay right there, mister.
I did not ask you to exit your vehicle.
- Sir, I was just stretching my legs.

Yes, sir.
Tell me one thing first.
- What in the hell did I do wrong?
- Doing 78 mph in a 55 limit.
- What are you doing?
- The gun, Rayanne, where is it?
- What are you talking about?
- Where is Franks gun?
He never goes anywhere without that gun.
Shit!

You might wanna check?
Very funny, Frank,

Thats bullshit!
Youve been sticking your nose in my business.

Youre pathetic!
Anyway, Frank,

Youre in there!
Brian, you son of a bitch!
- Who are you?
- Im the one you sent back, remember?
What?
Youre Brian and something here sends
people back in time. Take me for example.
I dont know you.
I was here, you sent me back
and Ive just relived a nightmare!
- I have never seen you before in my life.
- Yes, you have!
If what youre saying is true...
...I wouldnt remember it
because it wouldnt have happened yet.
- OK, OK.
- This is incredible. I mustve documented it.
No, you listen to me, Brian.
A lot of people were killed.
Now the killer is after me.
- Well call the police.
- That will not work.
I want you to send me back.
- llI change what happened. I can make it work.
- Are you insane?
- I dont know what the effects might be!
- llI tell you what the effects are... People die.
- You might make it worse.
- Ive already made it worse.
- llI need more time, at least an hour.
- Ive only designed it for 20 minutes.
Thatll put me right back where I was.
Youll have to come.
You want proof that your machine work s?
You come with me.
Theyll have no idea that we know.
This gives us an advantage.
When you get back, tell the police
theres a crazy man shooting people.
- Cet them to the nearby gas station. Know it?
- Yeah.
When youve made the call,
you meet me, right?
Youre that woman from Chicago.
With the hostages.
Yeah. Pity this thing
cant go back three days. Cet on.
- You first.
- Dont you trust me?
Something like that. Come on, together.
That is one good-looking belt buckle.
It just popped into my head, dont ask me how.
Ive heard it before, Frank,
its a really stupid joke.
You dont know what Im talking about.
It would look even better
with your forehead pressed against it.
You thought that was original?
Dont take it personal.
After all the stress,
with my car breaking down and all.
Oh, I am ready to relax!
Cut loose. Know what I mean?
Yeah, hell, its Thursday, right?
Coddammit, its only a day
away from the weekend.
Thats right!
- What about your car?
- Hell with it.
I like yours better anyway.
I just love a big, old Cadillac.
- Its so powerful.
- It is, isnt it?
I gotta tell you something.
Theres more under me than a Cadillac engine.
Why dont we go somewhere
and you show me, huh?
Rayanne, that sounds like fun, dont it?
You stop it. This isnt funny.
Come on, Rayanne,
you know how much I love this.
Theres a motel about five miles up.
Well go there.
- Ooh, I love motels.
- You do?
- Do whatever you want in em.
- Yeah.
Not give em your real name.
- Trash the shit outta the room, then leave.
- Yeah, I like that!
Lm gonna stop at this station for a minute.
- llI take a tequila and lime.
- Tequila and lime? Yahoo!
Lets dance in hell! What sounds better?
Im so glad your car...
Keep driving.
Take your hands off the wheel,
llI blow your brains to the border.
What the hell do you want?
Slow down.
If thats all, why didnt you just ask?
Damn!
So you changed your mind about the motel?
Youll let this car pass us.
All right.
Rayanne, I thought you were boogie.
You aint seen nothin yet.
OK, dont get any ideas.
Just keep doing what youre doing.
Afternoon, Officer.
- What the...?
- Dont test me.
As soon as you can,
get right away from this asshole, OK?
Then again, I may kill him,
solve both our problems.
Bitch!
I try to help you, this is the gratitude I get?
Coddammit, woman, learn some manners.
This shit dont float in Texas.
Thats why I left.
Just let it go on by. As difficult as it is,
try and act like a normal human being.
Coddamn.
Cimme that!
Thats it! Stop it!
What the hell is happening, Rayanne?
I dont know who your lady friend is...
- Vy lady?
... but I know what youre doing.
And theres no way Im gonna let you
or anybody else take whats rightfully mine!
- What are you talking about?!
- Rayanne, hes gonna kill you.
- Coddamn right!
- I will kill you.
Kill me? You wont kill me.
- Shut up!
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
You stupid shit-bitch!
Youre gonna shoot, shoot me!
I am truly amazed, Rayanne.

Look what you did to my goddamn vehicle.
What the hell...?
Help! Help me.
Holy shit!
Shes gonna kill me!
- Crazy psycho bitch!
- What the hells going on?
Shes got a gun. She killed my wife.
- Rayanne?
- Yeah.
Ill take care of you later, taco head.
I didnt do nothin, I swear, lady. Please?
Wait!
- Weve gotta get that piece of shit.
- Cet in!
We cant catch him, hes too far ahead.
- Your pick-up will soon give him trouble.
- No, its just been serviced.
Have you checked the tyres?
- How did you know?
- Womans intuition.
See if you can find some ammo for this thing.
Shit.
Where the hell are the police?
Brian, you bastard!
- Whos Brian?
- Never mind.
Franks in that building with your gun.
How did you know I had a gun?
This is Texas, isnt it?
Be careful.
Dont you move!
Lady, whatever you want, take it.
You got that right.
Im looking for your buddy Frank.
- Who?
- Frank! Where is he?
I got a little something for him.
Im right here, sweetheart!
- Come and get me.
- Come on out, Frank.
Ts ovvoer
Its not over till that big,
ugly, fat woman sings that little song.
Ya, da-da-da-da!
Sam, I think I found your missing daughter here.
Shit!
Suppose these are real...
Officer, I can explain.
- Shit.
- I got it covered, Officer! I got her.
Everybody, drop your guns.
- Both of you, put the guns down.
- I cant do that, Officer.
That man wants to kill me
and hes his accomplice.
- Sam?
- I dont know what shes talking about.
- Hes gonna kill you, dont trust him.
- That is bullshit, Officer.
I picked her up hitchhiking. She killed my wife,
shell kill Sam and me. Arrest her.
Bullshit! Hes a thief and a killer. Hes carrying
some sort of contraband. Check in his shirt.
OK...
First, everybody put your guns down.
We can work this out.
Come on now.
Well work this out,
but I wont put this down before you disarm him.
You hear her, sir?
Shell lower her weapon if youll lower yours.
Who the hell are you?
OK, thats fair enough.
Hell, youre a professional
law-enforcement officer.
I cant trust you, I cant trust nobody, can I?
Hell, its a shame, Officer.
Real sad to see a woman just snap like that.
Especially such a pretty one.
Sir, Ive got her covered.
Lower your gun and open your shirt.
- What?
- You heard. Put the gun down, open your shirt.
Keep an eye on him, Officer.
OK, easy, easy. There aint nothing here.
Aint nothing here.
Hell, all I got here is a beer belly
and a couple of bullets for you!
She was right... You were wrong!
You bastard. You killed her.
Rayanne always did like it south of the border.
Co ahead.
Co ahead.
I said, go ahead. Cet it.
Found a peanut, found a peanut
Found a peanut just now
What do we do now?
You take her on foot.
Ill mow her down with that.
Sounds reasonable.
But what do we do with the bodies?
Hell, say a prayer,
take their watches and wallets and burn em!
Thats gonna stink.
Just now...
Stop!
- This doesnt look good.
- Stop! Stop!
- Dont!
- Dont wanna hit her.
Let me in, please!

- Where?
Just go, away from here.
Shit!
- Turn around!

This guy wants to kill me.

You are breaking the law!
Youre on the wrong side of the road!
Bumper car!

I thought Id get myself a beer now, Frank.
Want one?
Well, baby...

What kid?
Coddammit!
Dont be difficult

Hes hiding, sweetheart.
Wouldnt you be if there was a maniac loose?
Brian, arent you a little late?
- You know him?
- Frank.
Well, its an itsy-bitsy world after all.
- The two of you were in on this together?
- Ive never seen her before in my life.
All right. Well go to Juarez in that mother
and you get movin. Im going to Vexico!
Wait.
Listen, if youre responsible for this,
you wont make it to the border.
- Theyll send you right back.
- Why?
- Theyre tight with us, the Vexicans.
- Why?
Well...
...free trade.
- Free trade, my ass!
- llI just kill you both now.
- Hold on.
Theres another way.
- Another way? Is that right?
- Yes.
Tell me.
Remember that experiment I was working on?
That sci-fi bullshit?
I got it to work.
Yeah? Is it gonna get me
to Vexico any quicker?
No, no.
But you can go back, can change all this.
- You can go clean, no running.
- Yeah?
Bullshit!
I did it once already.
- With her.
- You bastard.
Is that right?
Yes, Frank.
Thats how I know all about you.
You know all about me?
Yeah. Whats my favourite colour then?
Huh?
Whats my middle name?
What did I have for breakfast?
What universities did I attend?
This is a bunch of bullshit. You know
nothing about me. Cet in the goddamn car.
You always stop here, Frank.
Veet Sam, get some money and beer,
foreign beer because
it reminds you of your dad.
He went to Australia when you were ten.
I cant imagine you got past fourth grade.
Not even Rayanne knew about the money.
Thats how you knew the end of my joke.
Hell, Brian.
Beam me on up!
Lets check this little experiment of yours out.
But first...
- Cet up!
- Ow!
This is quite a little family.
Four peas in a pod in the tunnel of love.
- Why didnt you call the cops?
- I did call em. They laughed and hung up.
All right, Vr and Vrs Conversational, knock it off.
You try anything funny,
I blow this bastards brains out.
Come on.
- Damn!
- Come on!
Open sesame!
Cet up, boy.
- How the hell do you know Frank?
- He had some difficult-to-procure microchips.
I didnt know he was a gun-toting psychopath!
Yes, he was loud and obnoxious and
smelled bad, but I had no idea he was insane!
This is over some stinking computer chips?
Not just computer chips.
These are very-difficult-to-obtain,
government-developed microchips.
We have to go back again, Brain.
Ive never pushed the system this far.
Its very risky.
If we dont go back to the beginning,
itll never end.
Whats happening?
Oh, no.
Dammit!
Ten minutes?
Thats not enough time. Undo it.
I got news.
Undo never got programmed into the system!
- What? Undo never got programmed in?
- For dead mice, it didnt matter.
- Reboot it or something.
- You dont get it.
Its plugged into the entire complex
and its set to go.
Anything that comes in contact with that disk
will trigger the effects.
Oh, Cod, hes gonna go back and kill everybody.
- Well be there to stop him.
- We wont know that he knows.
We know now.
But it wont be us now, itll be us then, right?
Wait!
Brian!
Where are you? Where the hell are you?
Brian!
Frank, stop!
Oh, hell, there you are!
Whoa.
Ah!
Stop!
Dad, that woman needs help.
- I dont know, this doesnt look good.
- Stop.
- Dont.
- I dont want to hit her.
Cet in. Hes coming in the troopers car.
Turn, Dad, theres somebody coming.
How do you know that?
- I went through the machine too.
- Oh, my Cod.
Yaaa! Whoo!
- Thats a police car.
- The cops dead.
The driver is a killer.
- Lets go.
- Not reverse!
Ha-ha!
Oh, Cod.
Hang on!
M ovvoe! M ovvoe!
Co faster!
Look out!
Hang on! Oh, Cod!
What happened?
You sent this kid
back through your machine, Brian.
No.
Yes! He told me hes gone through it.
That machine has got to be destroyed.
We go back one more time,
one more time to the beginning,
so none of this can happen again.
60 minutes.
Itll strain the system.
This whole place will blow.
Thatll be after were long gone.
Come on.
I thought you two would show up soon.
- How did you get in?
- Hell, you showed me.
Dont you remember?
Ha!
You dont, do you?
The only one that would is that little kid.
And I guess
hes outta the picture entirely now.
What do you want, Frank?
Well...
...lll tell you, Brian.
That is a damned amazing machine
you got there.
Im thinking
about the fun I can have with it.
What I could do, is kill both of you,
zap myself back ten minutes and kill you again.
And again and again and again. Ha!
Not a very noble ambition.
Aim a little higher, you bastard!
To hell with that.
Rayannes gone and I wanna have fun.
But you know what?
Lm not familiar with that particular procedure,
Brian. Youll have to explain it to me.
No, I wont.
Well, Im sorry to say, sir,
you dont have a choice.
Its all up to you, Brian.
How much time do you want?
A couple of hours.
Its not in my nature to be greedy, Brian.
- Times a-wasting!
- Brian, dont.
- Sit down!
- Argh!
Son of a bitch!
Now Brian, dont be no stupid fool now.
Dont be a hero.
- OK.
- Come on.
Dont worry about the bitch.
Cive me the goddamn thing. Come on!
Point it to the time you want and hit Enter.
Youre a bright guy, figure it out.
What do I do? I press two hours
and Enter at the same time?
Oh, Cod!
Youd look good strapped to the hood of my car.
Howdy.
Cot a little car trouble, huh, honey?
No.
No? Sure look s like it.
Sure you dont need anything?
No, I sure dont.
All right.
Cant say I didnt try.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Uh-uh.
You take care of yourself, lady.
What the hell was that about?
Huh?
What seems to be the problem, maam?
Hi, Im Karen Warren.
I work with the Chicago Police Department.
Need a lift?
I dont care what you did
and who you made love to.
Its just you and me now.
This moneys for you and me, baby!
Come on now, honey.
Come on.
Put that gun away.
Now you aint gonna shoot me, Rayanne.
I know that.
Cause you love me.
Drop the gun, maam.
Drop it.
- This doesnt look good.
- I think youre right.
- Lets move.
- Lets go on down.
Madam, put your hands over your head.
Madam, Im gonna have to ask you to step away.
Aint nothing you can do here. Its all over.
