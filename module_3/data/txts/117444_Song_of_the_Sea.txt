to the waters and the wild

for the world's

Bedtime. Finish up, you two.
Dad, look

Oh.
BEN: She's singing her song
so that she can send all the
fairies home across the sea.
And look, look, she's
turning into a seal.
Do you like the selkie?
She's beautiful.
But we have to finish it
before the baby comes.
We have lots of time
to finish it, Ben.
But it's time to sleep now.
Okay.
(CU BARKING)
Cu, good boy.
(LAUGHS)
(GASPS)
Are you all right?
I'm fine. It's fine.
Comfy?
Mmm-hmm.
Now, settle down. There's
something I want to give you.
(PLAYING TUNE)
(GASPS) What is it?
This is an ancient shell that my
mother gave me a long time ago.
Hold it to your ear
and listen carefully.
You'll hear
the song of the sea.
(GASPS)
I can hear the sea.
(CHUCKLES)
Keep listening.
(SINGING IN IRISH GAELIC)
Mum?
BRONACH: Yes?
I can't wait for
the baby to come.
We're going to be

Of course you are.
You're going to be the best
big brother in the world.

CONOR: Bronach?
BEN:Mum?
I'm so sorry.
CONOR: Bronach!
Mum?
Mum?
(BEN SINGING)
Here, Cu, look at this.
Mum used to
tell me the story.
It's the giant Mac Lir
and his dogs.
They're best friends,
like us.
Cu, don't go too close to
the water, it's dangerous.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
For someone who hasn't
learned how to talk,
you are really loud.

Oh, come on, Saoirse!
Why don't you

Ugh.

and I say there's
no going in the water.
It's dangerous.
I can't.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

You nearly got me killed.
Come out,
with your hands up!
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)
BEN: Don't turn around,
keep going.
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)
Dad, she went
into the water
and nearly
got me killed!
Just because
it's her birthday,
she thinks she can do
whatever she likes.
You'd better give
it to her this time
'cause I'm not
minding her anymore.
Dad!
What? Are you playing
cops 'n' robbers?
Are you going to
give out to her?
Ah! Here's the birthday girl.
Come up here to me.
Dad!
You were under arrest,
were you?
Dad?
(SHIP HORN BLOWING

Are you here for the birthday
party at the lighthouse today?
Young Saoirse is six,

(MUFFLED SPEECH)

(CAR HONKING HORN)
Ugh! Granny.
She's going to
try and make us
move to the city again,
isn't she?
I don't know how you can
live in this awful place.
You children are a state.
(PARROT SQUAWKS)
Is that your
birthday outfit?
Haven't you learnt
to speak yet?
The doctors said she
will in her own time.
Hmph.
The child can't be dressed
like that on her birthday.
It's a disgrace!
Put this on.
Little girls
only turn six once.
And they need to
be properly dressed.
Now, isn't that lovely?
Don't move now,
until I call you.
(SIGHS)

(INHALES DEEPLY)
BEN: No, that's mine!
Mum gave it to me,

She's stealing

She's nothing but
a dirty stealer.
I don't want to hear it.
GRANNY: Saoirse!
Your granny
wants you downstairs.
(GROANING)
Now, Saoirse, try some of my nettle
tea and gooseberry buns there.
Very good
for the voice.
It might cure you.
Now, everybody ready for Saoirse
to blow out the candles, eh?
I want to capture the
emotion of the day.
One big, happy family.
Smile on the count

Ready?

I'm just heading over to the

You're better off not thinking
about that night, you know.
Her anniversary is
just once a year, Mum.
What do you want?
You want a story?
Hmm. Okay, I'll tell
you a story.
Did you ever hear of
Macha the Owl Witch?
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Well, she's evil.
You know the island
out at sea?
It's called Mac Lir.
It's called that because it's not an
island at all, it's a huge giant.
Macha's owls took all the giant's
feelings and turned him to stone.
And do you know
the worst of it?
She was his mother!
(SAOIRSE GASPS)
He was her first victim and
she hasn't stopped since.
To this day, all the fairies are
afraid to come out on Halloween night
because if they do,
Macha's owls will find them
and take their feelings
and turn them to stone.
Tomorrow is Halloween.
Macha's owls
might even come here
and take Dad's feelings
and turn him to stone!
And then nobody
would love you.
And this is
what Macha looks like.

She's not safe

I know what's best.
CONOR: Hold on a second, Mum.
No, you hold on.
Where were you?
Off in the pub with that

What's wrong? I don't think
it's the right coat.
Oh, no.
She can't sing.
She can't even talk.

You're the one that
gave me the last verse.
(MOSSY AND SPUD GASPS)

used to sing it.
She said it was a fairy song.
That'd be right.

Now, let's see...
This is Mac Lir, the great giant.

Such was his anguish

to take his suffering away.
(CRYING STOPS)

turned to stone.
SEANACHAI: That's right.

the fairies to stone.
And now they're

Can you help me?
No.
But...
SEANACHAI:
Well, you see now...
I wouldn't have a clue
about human children.
BEN: Why? I only know
about my own kind.
But I think
she is your kind.
Or partly anyway. The fairies
said she was a selkie.
Ooh!
Whoa!
What did you say?
A selkie? Really?
Yeah, they were
talking about a coat
and a song and
now I've lost her.
Something is wrong.
They've just been woken
and are already fading?
Oh!
Why?
The sulcha and the selkie,
all of us are connected.
This is not good.
Something must've
happened to her.
That's what
I'm trying to say.
I lost her down here.
Did the selkie have
her coat with her?
No, it's at home.
My dad took it.
(GROANS)
Blasted humans!
They don't have a clue.
You must get the coat back to her.
Do you hear me?
But I don't know
where she is.
Hold on a moment, laddie.
Very few hairs still grow because
very few of us are left.
But the selkie's,
hers still grows.
Hmm.
That's her.
That's when I lost her.
Let's see
what happens then.
(OWLS HOOTING)
(GASPS)
What's wrong?
Macha has her now.
She'll be turned to
stone soon, no doubt.
You see, without her coat,
the selkie has no voice.
And without her song,
she'll not last the night.
And we'll all
share in her fate.
Oh, no. I've got
to get out of here.
I have to find her.
Wait now.
You still have a chance.
(BEN SCREAMS)
Follow this, it will lead
you through the tunnel.
Mind, it won't be easy.
Macha has lost all hope.
And she will try and
make you lose hope, too.
The selkie will not last long
beyond dawn without her coat.
You must hurry.
Okay.
Oh. And be careful.
Why? What's down there?
Uh...
(SINGING IN IRISH GAELIC)

Dad?
Dad, where's Mum?
Where's Mum?
Dad?

This is your sister.
You're her big brother.

(OWLS HOOTING)
Okay, Okay-
FAIRY 1: Be careful!
(EXCLAIMS)
FAIRY 2: Be brave!
Ahh!

(YELLING)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
(LIGHTNING CRASHING)
(WOMAN SIGHS)
Ooh.
You look wet and tired,
human child.
Macha?
I am she.
Really?
The Owl Witch
from the stories?
(OWLS HOOTING)
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)
Well, now,
those stories always
paint me as the bad one.
But I'm not so terrible,
you know.
I'm just trying
to help everyone.
Yeah, well, what's in
all these jars then?
Just nasty things, you know.
Nobody needs them.
I know you have my sister.
Let her go!
Now, now, now, the selkie
child is safe and sound.
Don't you worry.
I have taken good care
of the poor little thing.
You're half turned to stone.
Saoirse can help you.
She can help all of you.
Ah, she can't help,
not really help.
Not the way I do.
I see it, Ben, your pain.
You're so full
of emotions.
I can see them
in your face.
Nasty, terrible things.
They make you feel so awful.
You worry so much
for such a young boy,
don't you?
You lost your mother,
didn't you?
My son lost someone,
too, a long time ago.
But I found away
to help him.
Now, if someone said that they
could take that pain away,
would you let them?
I suppose.
That's all I do, Ben.
I take away the pain.
It doesn't hurt.
It will never hurt again.
(cu BARKING)
No, it doesn't help at all,
it just makes things worse.
Please, try to understand.
We need your help.
(GRUMBLING)
Don't take me for a fool!
I know what's best for you!
Cu!
(GRUMBLING)
Don't let them control you.
Now see what I've become because
of those terrible feelings.
I'm sick of feelings
that come bubbling up.
(SIGHS)
Excuse me.
Where was I now?
(cu BARKING)
Cu!
Oh. Stubborn boy,
where are you going?
(OWLS HOOTING)
Come down out of that,
come here.
BEN: I'm coming, Cu.
MACHA: There's nothing up
there that's any use to you.
(PANTING)
You'd be better
off calming down
and not getting
too worked up, Ben.
Cu! You're standing on
the door. Get off it!
Let me help you.
(GRUNTING)
(BEN SCREAMS)
(GRUNTING)
Good boy!
Where's Saoirse?
(WHIMPERING)
Oh, no. Saoirse.
Wake up!
She did this to you?
(WHEEZING)
(BANGING ON DOOR) MACHA: You
see how peaceful she is, Ben?
You see how I have
taken all her cares away?
She is just as
a child should be,
without troubles,
without worry.
There's got to be a way out.
(EXCLAIMS)
Macha, please, please?
You don't understand.
If she doesn't sing
her song, she'll die.
So will you, and your son,
and all your kind.
MACHA: Open the door! At once.
At once, I tell you!
(WHOOSHING)
Do excuse
my little outburst.
If I can free your feelings,
then maybe...
(WHINES)
Sorry, Cu.
MACHA: Silly human child.
The jars are enchanted, they
cannot be broken by brute force.
The shell. it caused
the jars to break before.
(SILENCE)
MACHA: There is no way out.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Open the door, human child.
Come here, Cu. Keep the old
witch quiet, will you?
(MACHA EXCLAIMING)
Good boy.
Saoirse, I think
you need to do it.
(MACHA POUNDING ON DOOR)
(cu GROWLING)
MACHA: Let me in!
Saoirse?
It's going to be okay.
MACHA: Let me in!
It's okay, Saoirse.
We don't have much time.
I shouldn't have
been so mean to you.
It's not your fault,
it never was.
I should've been
a better brother to you.
I'm sorry.
MACHA: Let me in
this minute!
(SINGING
IN IRISH GAELIC)
(SAOIRSE PLAYING TUNE)
(cu BARKING)
(POUNDING CONTINUES)
That's it, Saoirse!
MACHA: Let me in!
BEN: You're doing it.
That's it.
(OWLS SCREECHING)
(SCREAMS)
BEN: Come on, Saoirse!
Leave those jars alone.
BEN: That's it, Saoirse!
(LAUGHING) Stop it!
Stop it!
(SOBBING)
BEN: It's working, Saoirse.
MACHA: Stop it. Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
(MACHA WAILING)

Stop!
(BEN SCREAMS)
(OWLS HOOTING)
(SIGHS)
You did it!
You did it, Saoirse!
(BEN LAUGHS)
Saoirse!
(WHINING)
Oh, no.
Oh, no, please stay awake,
Saoirse, please.
(MACHA SOBBING)
I have been
so lost for so long.
Macha?
Please, forgive me.
I couldn't bear to see my
son suffering so much.
I couldn't bear it.
Please, Macha, my sister is sick.
Please, help us.
(SPEAKING IRISH GAELIC)
You poor thing.
What have I done?
I've wasted the precious
time you had left.
You must reunite her with her
coat before it's too late.
But we're still so far from home.
Do you have a car?
(LAUGHING) A car!
I have something better.
BEN: She's so gray.
MACHA: Aye, you must be swift.
Climb on Cu's back
with your sister.
You are a brave
and loyal dog.
May the wind travel with you,
may your journey be swift,
for you carry the hope of all the
Shee with you this dawn. Go now!
(cu BARKS)
Go, Cu, run!
(BEN LAUGHS)
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Cu!
(GASPS) Oh, they're gone.
Whoo!
(cu BARKS)
Whoa!
No, stay awake, Saoirse.
Cu, go as quick as you can.
There's home.
(SAOIRSE SHIVERING)
It's going to be all right.
We're going to find your
coat and you'll be better.
Cu will stay with you.
(cu WHINING)
Dad, where's Saoirse's coat?
Ben? What?
What are you doing here?
BEN: What did you do
with Saoirse's coat?
Saoirse's what?
Where is she?
She's up at the light.
She needs it.
Saoirse.
(GASPS)
Saoirse, no.
Dad! She needs her coat, Dad.
Stop it, Ben.
(cu BARKING)
No, Dad. What did you do
with Saoirse's coat?
Ben, stop this.
She needs to get
to a hospital.
Where is her coat?
It's gone, all right?
I threw it into
the ocean.
I should've
done it years ago.
Now, get in the boat!
(BARKING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(GRUNTING)
I can get...
I can get her coat back.
I can do this.
Sit down, Ben.
Ben?
Ben!Ben!
Ben!
Stay with her, Cu.

BEN: Whoo-hoo!
(CONOR LAUGHING)
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)
Are you okay?
Yeah.
SAOIRSE: Ben?
Saoirse?
She's not getting better.
She has to sing.
I don't know if she can.
Try and copy me,
Saoirse, okay?
(SINGING IN IRISH GAELIC)

(BRONACH HUMMING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Mum! Mum, please?
Wait. Please, don't.
Please, don't
take her from us.
Please, Mum.
She's all we have.
(GASPS)
All of my kind
must leave tonight.
But, Saoirse,
you are part human.
If I take her coat, our
worlds will be untangled.
Mum...
And she can stay with you.
SAOIRSE: Mum,
I want to stay.
Bronach.
I loved you so much.
I still do.
Can't you stay,
too, Mum? Please?
(SOBBING)
My son.
Remember me,
in your stories
and in your songs.
Know that I will
always love you.
Always.
Bye.
(cu BARKING)
It's as though
I've been asleep,
all these years.
I'm so sorry.
I know, Dad.
Thank God! I thought
you were all killed.
Ooh!
Hold it.
Granny!
We're all right now, Mum.
We're all right now.
(BARKING)
(SAOIRSE LAUGHING)
Ben, Dad, come on, quick!
Two seconds,
we'll finish this off.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
All right, make a wish
and blow them out on three.
ADULTS: One, two, three.
(ALL LAUGHING)
(WOMAN SINGING
IN IRISH GAELIC)
(SINGING) Hush now my Storeen
Close your eyes and sleep
Waltzing the waves
Diving the deep
Stars are shining bright
The wind is on the rise
Whispering words
Of long-lost lullabies
Oh, won't you come with me?
Where the moon is made of gold
And in the morning sun
We'll be sailing
Oh, won't you come with me?
Where the ocean meets the sky
And as the clouds roll by
We'll sing the song of the sea
I had a dream last night
And heard the sweetest sound
I saw a great white light
And dancers in the round
Castles in the sand
Cradles in the trees
Don't cry
I'll see you by and by
Oh, won't you come with me?
Where the moon is made of gold
And in the morning sun
We'll be sailing
Oh, won't you come with me?
Where the ocean meets the sky
And as the clouds roll by
We'll sing the song of the sea
