Dougal, settle down now, please.
It won't be long.
<i>Next.</i>
- British?
- Yes.
- First trip to New York?
- Yes.
Anything edible in there?
No.
Livestock?
Must get that fixed. No.
Let me take a look.
<i>Welcome to New York.</i>
Thank you.
Next.
<i>And it was like a wind.</i>
<i>Or like a ghost.</i>
<i>But dark.</i>
And I saw its eyes.
Shining white eyes.
A dark wind, with eyes?
It's like a dark mass.
And it dove down
there. Down underground.
<i>Someone ought to do something about it.</i>
<i>It's everywhere, this
thing. It's out of control.</i>
You get anything?
<i>Dark wind. Blah, blah.</i>
<i>Some sorta atmospheric
hooey. Or electrical.</i>
<i>You thirsty?</i>
No. I'm on the wagon.
Promised Martha I'd lay off.
<i>It's atmospheric.</i>
Out of the way, folks. Coming through!
<i>This great city sparkles with
the jewels of man's inventions.</i>
Movie theaters, automobiles,
the wireless, electric lights,
<i>- all dazzle and bewitch us.
- I'm so sorry.</i>
But where there is light,
there is shadow, friend.
<i>Something is stalking our city,</i>
wreaking destruction, and then
disappearing without a trace!
<i>We have to fight.</i>
Join us, the Second
Salemers, in our fight.
Excuse me, doll. Just
trying to get to the bank.
We have to fight together
for the sake of our...
<i>Watch it!</i>
So sorry. My case.
No harm done.
Excuse me.
Friend.
What drew you to our meeting today?
I was just passing.
<i>Are you a seeker?</i>
A seeker after truth?
<i>I'm more of a chaser, really.</i>
Hear my words.
And heed my warning.
<i>And laugh if you dare.</i>
Witches live among us.
We have to fight together
for the sake of our children.
For the sake of tomorrow.
<i>What do you say to that, friend?</i>
Excuse me.
Can I help you, sir?
No, I was just waiting.
What brings you here?
Same as you.
You're here to get a
loan to open up a bakery?
Yes.
What are the odds of that?
- Well, may the best man win, I guess.
- Excuse me.
Mr. Kowalski, Mr.
Bingley will see you now.
<i>You're currently working</i>
in a canning factory.
That's the best I can do.
I only got back in '24.
From Europe, sir.
Yeah. I was part of the
expeditionary forces there.
You gotta try the paczkis, okay?
It's my grandmother's recipe.
The orange zest just...
What do you propose to
offer the bank as collateral?
<i>There are machines now</i>
that can produce hundreds
of donuts an hour.
I know. But they're
nothing like what I can do.
<i>The bank must be
protected, Mr. Kowalski.</i>
Good day to you.
Mr. English Guy!
I think your egg is hatching.
What just happened?
I was over there. Came over...
<i>In you hop.</i>
<i>Everyone settle down.</i>
<i>Stay. Dougal, don't
make me come in there.</i>
Don't make me come down there.
Absolutely not.
<i>Alohomora.</i>
So you're gonna steal the money?
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>
Mr. Bingley!
<i>No. Don't play that.</i>
Look.
Don't shoot.
For the last time, you pilfering pest,
paws off what doesn't belong to you.
<i>Someone's robbing the bank!</i>
Awfully sorry about that.
What was that?
<i>Nothing that need concern you.</i>
Now, unfortunately, you
have seen far too much.
If you wouldn't mind,
if you just stand there,
this'll be over in a jiffy.
Sure.
Sorry.
Bugger.
Who are you?
- Newt Scamander. And you are?
- What's that thing in your case?
That's my Niffler.
Say, you've got something on your...
Why in the name of Deliverance
Dane did you let that thing loose?
I didn't mean to. He's
incorrigible, you see.
- Anything shiny, he's all over...
- You didn't mean to?
- No.
- You could not have chosen
a worse time to let that creature loose.
We're in the middle of a situation here.
I'm taking you in.
Taking me in where?
Magical Congress of the
United States of America.
So you work for MACUSA.
What are you, some kind of investigator?
At least tell me you
took care of the No-Maj.
No-Magic. The
non-wizard!
Sorry, we call them Muggles.
You wiped his memory, right?
The No-Maj with the case?
That's a Section 3-A, Mr. Scamander.
I'm taking you in.
<i>Come on.</i>
Sorry, but I do have
things to do, actually.
You'll have to rearrange them.
What are you doin' in New York anyway?
I came to buy a birthday present.
Couldn't you have done that in London?
<i>No, there's only one breeder of
Appaloosa Puffskeins in the world,</i>
and he lives in New York. So, no.
I got a Section 3-A.
By the way, we don't allow the breeding
of magical creatures in New York.
<i>We closed that guy down a year ago.</i>
Goldstein.
Red.
Major Investigation Department.
- I thought you was...
- Major Investigation Department.
I got a Section 3-A.
The International Confederation is
threatening to send a delegation.
They think this is related to
Grindelwald's attacks in Europe.
I was there.
This is a beast.
No human could do what this thing
is capable of, Madam President.
Whatever it is, one thing
is clear. It must be stopped.
<i>It's terrorizing No-Majs.</i>
And when No-Majs are
afraid, they attack.
This could mean exposure.
It could mean war.
I made your position here
quite clear, Ms. Goldstein.
- Yes, Madam President.
- You're no longer an Auror.
There's been a minor...
This office is currently concerned
with very major incidents. Get out.
So you got your wand permit?
<i>All foreigners have to
have them in New York.</i>
I made a postal application weeks ago.
<i>Scamander...</i>
And you were just in Equatorial Guinea?
And I've just completed
a year in the fields.
I'm writing a book
about magical creatures.
Like an extermination guide?
No, a guide to help people understand
why we should be protecting these
creatures instead of killing them.
<i>Where is she?</i>
Did you just butt in on the
investigative team again?
Where have you been?
What?
Where'd she pick you up?
Have you been tracking
them Second Salemers again?
Of course not, sir.
Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir.
Afternoon, Abernathy.
Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.
He has a crazy creature in that case,
and it got out and
caused mayhem in a bank.
Let's see the little guy.
Tina.
I'm sorry, Grandma.
<i>My momma, your momma</i>
<i>Gonna catch a witch</i>
<i>Flying on a switch</i>
<i>Witches never cry</i>
<i>Witches gonna die</i>
<i>Witch number one, drown in the river</i>
<i>Witch number two, got
a noose to give her</i>
<i>Witch number three, gonna watch her burn</i>
<i>Witch number four, flogging take a turn</i>
Collect your leaflets before
you get food, children.
Is it a witch's mark, ma'am?
No.
He's okay.
I can't believe you
didn't obliviate that man.
If there's an inquiry, I'm finished.
Why would you be finished?
I'm not supposed to go
near the Second Salemers.
What was that?
Big moth.
<i>Quiet down! I'm trying
to get a statement.</i>
<i>I'm telling you, it's
a gas explosion again.</i>
I ain't taking the kids back
up there until it's safe.
Sorry, ma'am. There
ain't no smell of gas.
It weren't gas, officer. I seen it.
It was a gigantic, huge hippopoto...
Gas.
It was gas!
<i>Mr. Scamander!</i>
It was open?
Just a smidge.
That crazy Niffler
thing's on the loose again?
Might be.
Then look for it.
His neck's bleeding.
He's hurt.
Wake up! Mr. No-Maj.
<i>Mercy Lewis, what is that?</i>
It's nothing to worry about.
That is a Murtlap.
What else have you got in there?
Kowalski. Jacob.
You can't obliviate him.
We need him as a witness.
I'm sorry. You've just yelled
at me the length of New York
for not doing it in the first place.
- He's hurt! He looks ill.
- He'll be fine.
Murtlap bites aren't serious.
Yeah, I admit that is a slightly
more severe reaction than I've seen.
But if it was really
serious, he'd have...
What?
Well, the first symptom would
be flames out of his anus.
- He doesn't seem to...
- This is balled up!
It'll last 48 hours at the most.
I can keep him, if you want me to.
We don't keep them.
Mr. Scamander, do you know anything
about the wizarding community in America?
I do know a few things, actually.
I know that you have rather backwards
laws about relations with Non-Magic people.
That you're not meant to befriend them.
That you can't marry them,
which seems mildly absurd to me.
Who's gonna marry him?
You're both coming with me.
I don't see why I need to come with you.
- Help me.
- I'm dreaming, right?
Yeah.
I'm tired. I never went to the bank.
This is all just some
big nightmare, right?
For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.
<i>You all right there?</i>
And so this is the newsroom.
Let's go.
<i>How are you?</i>
<i>Make way for the Barebones.</i>
Now, they're just
putting the papers to bed,
as they say.
Mr. Shaw. Sir. He's with the Senator.
Never mind that, Barker.
I wanna see my father.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw,
but your son insisted.
Father, you're gonna wanna hear this.
I've got something huge.
<i>Your brother and I
are busy here, Langdon.</i>
<i>Working on his election campaign.</i>
<i>We don't have time for this.</i>
<i>This is Mary Lou Barebone from
the New Salem Preservation Society.</i>
And she's got a big story for you.
<i>There's strange things
going on all over the city.</i>
<i>The people behind this,
they are not like you and me.</i>
<i>This is witchcraft. Don't you see?</i>
<i>- Langdon.
- She doesn't want any money.</i>
Then either her story is worthless,
or she's lying about the cost.
Nobody gives away anything
valuable for free, Langdon.
<i>You're right, Mr. Shaw.</i>
What we desire is infinitely
more valuable than money.
It's your influence.
<i>Millions of people read your newspapers,</i>
and they need to be made
aware about this danger.
The crazy disturbances in the subway.
<i>Just look at the pictures.</i>
<i>I'd like you and your friends to leave.</i>
No. Look, you're missing a trick
here. Just look at the evidence!
<i>Langdon. Listen to Father and just go.</i>
Take the freaks with you.
<i>This is Father's office, not yours.</i>
<i>And I'm sick of this.
Every time I walk in here...</i>
<i>That's it!</i>
Thank you.
We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.
<i>We're not difficult to find.</i>
Until then,
we thank you for your time.
You dropped something.
Here you go, freak.
Why don't you put that in the
trash where you all belong?
Take a right here.
Before we go in...
I'm not supposed to
have men on the premises.
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I
can easily seek other accommodations.
No, you don't.
Watch your step.
<i>That you, Tina?</i>
Yes, Mrs. Esposito.
<i>Are you alone?</i>
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito.
<i>Teenie,</i>
you brought men home.
Gentlemen, this is my sister.
Wanna put something on, Queenie?
Sure.
So, who are they?
That's Mr. Scamander.
He's committed a serious infraction
of the National Statute of Secrecy.
He's a criminal?
And that's Mr. Kowalski. He's a No-Maj.
Teen, what are you up to?
He's sick. It's a long story.
Mr. Scamander has lost something
I'm going to help him find.
<i>You need to sit down, honey.</i>
He hasn't eaten anything all day.
That's rough.
He didn't get the money
he wanted for his bakery.
You bake, honey?
I love to cook.
<i>- You're a Legilimens?
- Yeah.</i>
But I always have trouble
with your kind. Brits.
<i>It's the accent.</i>
You know how to read minds?
Don't worry, honey.
Most guys think what you was
thinking first time they see me.
Now, you need food.
<i>- Hot dog? Again?
- Don't read my mind.</i>
<i>Not a very wholesome lunch.</i>
You prefer pie or strudel?
I really don't have a preference.
You prefer strudel, honey?
Strudel it is.
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.
We're not gonna poison you.
You're upset.
It's your mother again.
Somebody said something.
What did they say? Tell me.
Do you think I'm a freak?
No. I think you're a
very special young man,
or I wouldn't have asked
you to help me, now would I?
Have you any news?
I'm still looking.
Mr. Graves, if I knew whether
it was a girl or a boy...
My vision showed only
the child's immense power.
He or she is no older than 10.
I saw this child in close
proximity to your mother.
She I saw so plainly.
That could be any one of hundreds...
There's something else.
Something I haven't told you.
I saw you beside me in New York.
You're the one who
gains this child's trust.
You are the key. I saw this.
You want to join the wizarding world.
I want those things too, Credence.
I want them for you.
So find the child.
Find the child and we'll all be free.
<i>The job ain't that glamorous.</i>
I mean, I spend most days making coffee.
Unjinxing the john.
Tina's the career girl.
<i>We're orphans.</i>
Ma and Pa died of Dragon
Pox when we were kids.
You're sweet.
But we got each other.
Could you stop reading
my mind for a second?
Don't get me wrong, I love it.
This meal, it's insanely good.
<i>And this is what I do, I'm a cook.</i>
<i>And this is like the greatest
meal I have ever had in my life.</i>
You slay me.
I ain't never really
talked to a No-Maj before.
I am not flirting.
I'm just saying, don't
go getting attached.
He's gonna have to be Obliviated.
It's nothing personal.
You okay, honey?
So, Ms. Goldstein, I think Mr.
Kowalski could do with an early night.
Besides, you and I will need to be
up early tomorrow morning
to find my Niffler, so...
What's a Niffler?
Don't ask.
You guys can bunk in here.
I thought you might like a hot drink.
Mr. Scamander, look, cocoa.
Toilet's down the hall to the right.
Thanks.
Very much.
Come on.
Will you sit down?
Good idea.
That's definitely the Murtlap.
You must be particularly susceptible.
See, you're a Muggle,
so our physiologies
are subtly different.
Stay still.
That should stop the sweating.
And one of those should sort the twitch.
Here, take that.
Whatcha got there?
This, the locals call Swooping Evil.
<i>Not the friendliest of names.</i>
It's quite an agile fella.
<i>I've been studying
him, and I'm pretty sure</i>
that his venom could be quite
useful if properly diluted.
Just to remove bad memories, you know?
Probably shouldn't let
him loose in here, though.
<i>Come on.</i>
Down you come.
Thank Paracelsus.
If you'd have got out, that
could've been quite catastrophic.
So he's the real reason
I came to America.
To bring Frank home.
<i>Wait. No, sorry. Stay there.</i>
He's a wee bit sensitive to strangers.
Here you are.
He was trafficked, you see.
I found him in Egypt.
He was all chained up.
Couldn't leave him there.
I had to bring him back.
I'm gonna put you back where
you belong, aren't I, Frank?
To the wilds of Arizona.
All right, here they come.
Here who comes?
Graphorns.
You're all right.
So they're the last
breeding pair in existence.
So if I hadn't managed to rescue them,
that could've been the
end of Graphorns forever.
<i>You rescue these creatures?</i>
<i>Yes, that's right. Rescue,
nurture and protect them.</i>
<i>And I'm gently trying to educate
my fellow wizards about them.</i>
Titus, Finn.
Poppy, Marlow, Tom.
He had a cold.
He needed some body warmth.
All right, on you hop.
He has some attachment issues.
Now, come on, Pickett.
No, they're not gonna
bully you, now come on.
And that is exactly why
they accuse me of favoritism.
Dougal's gone.
<i>All right, I'm coming.</i>
Mum's here.
Let me take a look at you.
I know these guys.
Your Occamy.
<i>- What do you mean, my Occamy?
- Yes.</i>
Sorry, no, don't pet him.
They learn to defend themselves early.
See, their shells are made of silver,
so they're incredibly valuable.
Their nests tend to get
ransacked by hunters.
Thank you.
Mr. Scamander?
Call me Newt.
<i>Newt. I don't think I'm dreaming.</i>
What gave it away?
I ain't got the brains to make this up.
Would you mind throwing
some of those pellets
in with the Mooncalfs over there?
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- Just over there's...</i>
Bugger.
Niffler's gone.
<i>Course he has, little bugger.</i>
<i>Any chance to get his
hands on something shiny.</i>
What did you do today, Jacob?
I was inside a suitcase.
Take it easy.
Cutie.
There it is.
<i>Step back.</i>
- What's the matter with this?
- I said, step away.
What the hell is this thing?
It's an Obscurus.
I need to get going.
Find everyone who's escaped,
before they get hurt.
So they're currently in alien terrain
surrounded by millions of the most
vicious creatures on the planet.
Humans.
So where would you say
that a medium-sized creature
who likes broad open plains,
trees, sort of waterholes,
that sort of thing.
Where might she go?
In New York City?
<i>- Yes.
- Plains?</i>
Central Park.
And where is that exactly?
Where is Central Park?
I would come and show you,
but don't you think it's
kind of a double-cross?
The girls take us in,
they make us hot cocoa...
Now you do realize that once they see
that you stopped sweating, they
will obliviate you in a heartbeat?
What's "Bliviate" mean?
It'll be like you wake up
and all memory of magic gone.
I won't remember any of this?
No.
I'll help you.
Credence, where have you been?
I was looking for a place
for tomorrow's meeting.
There's a corner on
32nd Street that could...
I'm sorry, Ma.
<i>I didn't realize it was so late.</i>
I was watching you at dinner.
People like you, don't
they, Mr. Kowalski?
Well, I'm sure people
like you, too, huh?
Not really, no. I annoy people.
Why did you decide to be a baker?
Because I'm dying
in that canning factory.
Everyone there's dying. It just
crushes the life out of you.
- Do you like canned food?
- No.
Yeah, me neither.
That's why I wanna make pastries.
You know, it makes people happy.
We're going this way.
So did you get your loan?
No.
I ain't got no collateral.
Stayed in the army too long,
apparently. I don't know.
You fought in the war?
Of course I fought in the war.
Everyone fought in the war.
- You didn't fight in the war?
- I worked mostly with dragons.
Ukrainian Ironbellies.
Eastern Front.
<i>Fenestra.</i>
<i>Accio.</i>
<i>All right. Happy?</i>
One down, two to go.
They went that way, officer.
Hands up.
What is that?
Lion.
<i>You know,</i>
New York is considerably more
interesting than I'd expected.
Put this on.
But why would I have to
wear something like this?
Because your skull is susceptible
to breakage under immense force.
But we made 'em cocoa.
Here, you just pop this on.
Now there's absolutely
nothing for you to worry about.
Tell me, has anyone ever believed
you when you told them not to worry?
Well, my philosophy is that
worrying means you suffer twice.
She's in season.
<i>She needs to mate.</i>
Erumpent musk. She's mad for it.
Good girl.
Into the case.
Get!
<i>Reparo.</i>
Merlin's beard!
Tree!
They're exactly the same.
Same thing.
No, don't.
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
Good show, Mr. Kowalski.
Call me Jacob.
Two down, one to go.
<i>In you hop.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
<i>Tonight's keynote speaker</i>
<i>needs no introduction from me.</i>
<i>He's been mentioned
as a future president.</i>
<i>And if you don't believe me,</i>
<i>just read his daddy's newspapers.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I give you the senator
for New York, Henry Shaw.</i>
Thank you.
<i>And it's true,</i>
<i>we have made some progress.</i>
<i>But there is no reward for idleness.</i>
<i>So just as the odious
saloons have been banished...</i>
<i>So now the pool halls,</i>
<i>and these private parlors...</i>
What is that?
Witches.
<i>Our American friends
have permitted a breach</i>
of the Statute of Secrecy that
threatens to expose us all.
I will not be lectured by the man
who let Gellert Grindelwald
slip through his fingers.
Madam President, I'm sorry to
interrupt, but this is critical...
<i>You better have an excellent excuse</i>
for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.
Yes. I do.
<i>Ma'am,</i>
yesterday a wizard entered New
York with a case, this case,
full of magical creatures.
And unfortunately, some have escaped.
He arrived yesterday?
<i>You've known for 24 hours</i>
that an unregistered wizard set
magical beasts loose in New York,
and you see fit to tell us
only when a man has been killed?
Who's been killed?
Where is this man?
<i>Scamander?</i>
Hello, Minister.
<i>Theseus Scamander?</i>
The war hero?
No. This is his little brother.
<i>And what are you doing in New York?</i>
I came to buy an
Appaloosa Puffskein, sir.
Right.
What are you really doing here?
Who is this?
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President.
He's a No-Maj who got bitten by
one of Mr. Scamander's creatures.
<i>No-Maj? Obliviate him.</i>
Merlin's beard.
You know which of your creatures
was responsible, Mr. Scamander?
No creature did this.
Don't pretend.
You must know what that
was. Look at the marks.
That was an Obscurus.
<i>You go too far, Mr. Scamander.</i>
There is no Obscurial in America.
Impound that case, Graves.
<i>- Wait, no. Give that back.
- Arrest them.</i>
Don't hurt those creatures.
Please. You don't understand.
Nothing in there's dangerous.
We'll be the judges of that.
<i>Take them to the cells.</i>
<i>Don't hurt those creatures.
Nothing in there is dangerous.</i>
Please don't hurt my creatures.
They aren't dangerous!
I'm so sorry about your
creatures, Mr. Scamander.
<i>I truly am.</i>
Can someone please tell me
what this Obscurial,
Obscurius thing is, please?
There hasn't been one for centuries.
I met one in Sudan three months ago.
<i>There used to be more of
them, but they still exist.</i>
It was before wizards went underground,
when we were still
being hunted by Muggles.
Young wizards and witches sometimes
tried to suppress their magic
to avoid persecution.
<i>So, instead of learning to
harness or to control their powers,</i>
they developed what
was called an Obscurus.
It's an unstable,
uncontrollable dark force
that busts out and attacks.
And then vanishes.
<i>Obscurials can't survive long, can they?</i>
There's no documented case of an
Obscurial surviving past the age of 10.
The one I met in
Africa was 8 when she...
She was 8 when she died.
What are you telling me here?
That Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?
<i>Flying on a switch</i>
<i>Witches never cry</i>
<i>Witches gonna die</i>
<i>Witch number one, drown in the river</i>
<i>Witch number two, got a noose...</i>
<i>Hand out your leaflets.</i>
I'll know if you dump them.
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.
It was good to make
your acquaintance, Jacob.
<i>And I hope you get your bakery.</i>
You're an interesting
man, Mr. Scamander.
Mr. Graves.
You were thrown out of Hogwarts
for endangering human life.
- That was an accident.
- With a beast.
Yet one of your teachers argued
strongly against your expulsion.
Now,
what makes Albus Dumbledore
so fond of you?
I really couldn't say.
So setting a pack of dangerous
creatures loose here was
just another accident. Is that right?
Why would I do it deliberately?
To expose wizardkind.
To provoke war between the
magical and non-magical worlds.
Mass slaughter for the
greater good, you mean?
Yes.
<i>Quite.</i>
I'm not one of Grindelwald's
fanatics, Mr. Graves.
I wonder what you can tell
me about this, Mr. Scamander.
It's an Obscurus.
But it's not what you think.
I managed to separate
it from the Sudanese girl
<i>as I tried to save her.</i>
<i>So I wanted to take it home to study it.</i>
<i>But it cannot survive outside that.</i>
<i>It could not hurt anyone, Tina.</i>
So it's useless without the host?
That is a parasitical, magical
force that killed a child.
What on earth would you use it for?
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.
You brought this Obscurus
into the City of New York
in the hope of causing mass disruption,
breaking the Statute of Secrecy
and revealing the magical world.
You know that can't hurt
anyone. You know that.
You are therefore guilty
of a treasonous betrayal
of your fellow wizards
and are sentenced to death.
Miss Goldstein, who has
aided and abetted you...
No, she's done nothing of the kind.
Receives the same sentence.
Just do it immediately.
- I will inform President Picquery myself.
- Tina.
Don't do this, Bernadette. Please.
It don't hurt.
Come on, pumpkin. Time for bed.
Are you ready?
Don't that look good?
You wanna get in?
Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Queenie.
- They need you downstairs.
I'll obliviate this guy.
You ain't qualified.
Does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?
- How did you...
- Let me obliviate this guy,
and she'll never hear about it from me.
What are you doing?
Teen's in trouble. I'm trying to listen.
Jacob, where's Newt's case?
I think that guy Graves took it.
What, you're not gonna obliviate me?
Of course not. You're one of us now.
It's okay.
<i>Alohomora.</i>
<i>Aberto.</i>
He would know some fancy
spell to lock his office.
Okay, let's get the
good stuff outta you.
Witch!
Mr. Scamander!
Don't panic.
What do you suggest I do instead?
Jump.
Are you crazy?
Jump on him.
<i>Tina, listen to me.</i>
I'll catch you.
<i>I've got you, Tina.</i>
Leave his brains. Come on.
What is that thing?
Swooping Evil.
I love it.
Get in.
Queenie!
Where you going?
I'm sick, Mr. Abernathy.
Again?
Whatcha got there?
Ladies' things.
You wanna take a look? I don't mind.
Good gravy. No.
You get well now.
Thanks.
Credence, have you found the child?
I can't.
Show me.
My boy, the sooner we find this child,
the sooner you can put that pain
in the past where it belongs.
I want you to have this, Credence.
I would trust very few with it.
Very few.
You're different.
And when you find the
child, you touch this symbol,
and I will know and I will come to you.
Do this, and you will be honored
among wizards forever.
The child is dying, Credence.
Time is running out.
Your grandfather kept pigeons?
Mine bred owls.
I used to love feeding them.
Graves always insisted the
disturbances were caused by a beast.
We need to catch all your creatures
so he can't keep using
them as a scapegoat.
There's only one still missing.
Dougal, my Demiguise.
Slight problem is that, he's invisible.
Most of the time.
- How do you catch something...
- With immense difficulty.
Gnarlak.
He was an informant of
mine when I was an Auror.
He used to trade in magical
creatures on the side.
He wouldn't happen to have an
interest in paw prints, would he?
He's interested in anything he can sell.
<i>Tears of pearl</i>
<i>When the dragon snapped up his best girl</i>
<i>And the Billywig forgot to twirl</i>
<i>When his sweetheart left him cold</i>
<i>The unicorn done lost his horn</i>
<i>And the hippogriff...</i>
How's a guy get a drink in this joint?
What? Ain't you ever
seen a house-elf before?
Of course I have. I love house-elves.
My uncle is a house-elf.
Six shots of Gigglewater
and a Lobe-Blaster, please.
Are all No-Majs like you?
No. I'm the only one like me.
I've arrested half
of the people in here.
You can tell me to mind my business,
but I saw something in that
death potion back there.
I saw you hugging that Second Salem boy.
His name's Credence.
His mother beats him.
She beats all those kids she's adopted,
but she seems to hate him the most.
And she was the No-Maj you attacked?
That's how I lost my job.
I went for her in front of a
meeting of her crazy followers.
They all had to be Obliviated.
It was a big scandal.
It's him.
<i>'Cause love drives all of us wild</i>
You're the guy with the
case full of monsters?
News travels fast.
I was hoping you'd be able to tell
me if there've been any sightings.
Tracks, that sort of thing.
You got a pretty big price
on your head, Mr. Scamander.
Why should I help you
<i>instead of turning you in?</i>
I take it I'll have to
make it worth your while.
Let's consider it a cover charge.
MACUSA's offering more than that.
<i>Lunascope?</i>
I got five.
Frozen Ashwinder egg.
Wait a minute.
That's a Bowtruckle.
They pick locks, am I right?
You're not having him.
Good luck getting back
alive, Mr. Scamander,
<i>what with the whole
of MACUSA on your back.</i>
All right.
Pickett.
Something invisible's been
wreaking havoc around 5th Avenue.
<i>You may want to check out
Macy's Department Store.</i>
<i>Might have what you're looking for.</i>
Dougal.
<i>One last thing.</i>
There's a Mr. Graves
who works at MACUSA.
<i>I was wondering what you
knew of his background.</i>
You ask a lot of
questions, Mr. Scamander.
That can get you killed.
MACUSA are comin'.
You tipped them off?
Sorry, Mr. Gnarlak.
He reminds me of my foreman.
Whatcha doin', Credence?
Where'd you get this?
Give it back, Credence.
It's just a toy.
What is this?
<i>Take it off.</i>
I am not your ma.
Your mother
was a wicked, unnatural woman.
It was mine.
Modesty.
What is this?
Demiguise are fundamentally peaceful,
but they can give a
nasty nip if provoked.
<i>You two,</i>
head that way.
And try very hard not to be predictable.
<i>- Was that the Demiguise?
- No.</i>
<i>But I think it might be the
reason that the Demiguise is here.</i>
<i>Its sight operates on probability,</i>
so it can foresee the most
likely immediate future.
<i>What's it doing?</i>
He's babysitting.
What did you just say?
<i>This is my fault.</i>
I thought I had them all
but, I must have miscounted.
It was babysitting that?
Occamies are choranaptyxic.
So they grow to fill available space.
Mummy's here.
We need an insect!
Any kind of insect and a teapot.
Find a teapot!
I got it! I'll get it!
Teapot!
Roach in teapot.
Choranaptyxic.
They also shrink to
fit the available space.
Tell me the truth.
Was that everything that
came out of the case?
That's everything.
And that's the truth.
<i>Here she comes.</i>
- You happy to be home?
- Yeah.
Bet you're exhausted, buddy. Come on.
Just place him in the middle there.
There you go. That's right.
I think we need to talk.
I wouldn't have let
him keep you, Pickett.
Think I would rather chop off
my hand than get rid of you
after everything that you've
done for me. Now, come on.
Think we've talked about the
sulking before, haven't we?
Come on, give me a smile.
Now that is beneath you.
Who is she?
That's no one.
Leta Lestrange.
<i>I've heard of that family.</i>
Aren't they kind of, you know...
Please don't read my mind.
Sorry, I asked you not to.
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
People are easiest to
read when they're hurting.
<i>I'm not hurting.</i>
Anyway, it was a long time ago.
That was a real close
friendship you had at school.
Neither of us really
fitted in at school.
<i>- So, we became quite...
- You became real close?</i>
For years.
She was a taker.
<i>You need a giver.</i>
What are you two talking about?
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>School.</i>
Did you say school?
Is there a school?
A wizardry school here in America?
Of course. Ilvermorny.
It's only the best wizard
school in the whole world.
I think you'll find that the best
wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts.
Hogwash.
<i>Danger.</i>
He senses danger.
The Obscurial was here.
Where did she go?
Help me.
Didn't you tell me
you had another sister?
Please, help me.
- Where's your other sister, Credence?
- I need help.
The little one. Where did she go?
Please, just help me.
Your sister's in grave danger.
We need to find her.
What is this place?
Ma adopted Modesty out of here.
From a family of 12.
She misses her brothers and
sisters. She still talks about them.
Where is she?
I don't know.
You're a Squib, Credence.
I could smell it off
you the minute I met you.
What?
You have magical ancestry but no power.
But you said you could teach me.
<i>You're unteachable.</i>
<i>Your mother's dead.</i>
That's your reward.
I'm done with you.
Modesty?
There's no need to be afraid.
I'm here with your brother, Credence.
Out you come now.
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>
I trusted you.
I thought you were my friend.
I thought you were different.
You can control it.
I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.
Is that it? That's the Obscurial thing?
That's more powerful than any
Obscurial I've ever heard of.
If I don't come back,
look after my creatures.
Everything that you
need to know is in there.
What?
They're not killing it.
You heard him. Look after them.
Keep hold of that, honey.
I can't take you.
Please, let go of me, Jacob.
You're the one that
said I was one of yous.
Right?
It's too dangerous.
<i>To survive so long</i>
with this inside you, Credence,
is a miracle.
<i>You are a miracle.</i>
Come with me.
Think of what we could achieve together.
It's the Second Salem
boy. He's the Obscurial.
He's not a child.
His power must be so strong
he's somehow managed to survive.
Save him.
Mr. Graves.
Tina, you're always turning
up where you're least wanted.
Contain this.
Or we are exposed, and it'll mean war.
Credence, I can help.
<i>- Bar the area.
- Yes, sir.</i>
I don't want anyone else down there.
It is Credence, isn't it?
<i>I'm here to help you, Credence.</i>
I'm not here to hurt you.
I've met someone just
like you, Credence.
<i>A girl.</i>
<i>A young girl</i>
who'd been imprisoned.
She had been locked away, and
she'd been punished for her magic.
Can I come over to you?
That thing killed my son.
I want justice.
<i>I'll expose you for who you
are and what you've done.</i>
Look! Take photos.
Don't do this.
Keep talking, Tina.
Keep talking to him.
He'll listen to you.
He's listening.
I know what that woman did to you.
<i>I know that you've suffered.</i>
You need to stop this now.
Newt and I will protect you.
This man,
he's using you.
<i>Don't listen to her, Credence.</i>
<i>I want you to be free.</i>
<i>It's all right.</i>
That's it.
- You'll frighten him!
- Wands down!
Anyone harms him, they answer to me.
<i>You fools.</i>
Do you realize what you've done?
The Obscurial was killed
on my orders, Mr. Graves.
<i>Yes.</i>
And history will surely
note that, Madam President.
What was done here
tonight was not right.
He was responsible for
the death of a No-Maj.
He risked the exposure of our community.
He has broken one of
our most sacred laws.
A law that has us scuttling
like rats in the gutter.
<i>A law that demands that
we conceal our true nature.</i>
A law that directs those under
its dominion to cower in fear,
lest we risk discovery.
<i>I ask you, Madam President,</i>
I ask all of you...
Who does this law protect?
Us?
Or them?
I refuse to bow down any longer.
Aurors,
I'd like you to relieve
Mr. Graves of his wand
and escort him back...
<i>Accio!</i>
<i>Revelio.</i>
Do you think you can hold me?
We'll do our best, Mr. Grindelwald.
Will we die just a little?
I figured somebody ought to
keep an eye on this thing.
We owe you an apology, Mr. Scamander,
but the magical community is exposed.
<i>We cannot obliviate an entire city.</i>
<i>Actually,</i>
I think we can.
I was intending to wait
until we got to Arizona.
But it seems that now
you're our only hope, Frank.
<i>I'll miss you, too.</i>
<i>You know what you gotta do.</i>
<i>They won't remember anything.</i>
That venom has incredibly
powerful obliviative properties.
We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.
Get that case out of New York.
Is that No-Maj still here?
Obliviate him.
There can be no exceptions.
I'm sorry, but even one witness...
You know the law.
I'll let you say goodbye.
This is for the best.
I was never even supposed to be here.
I was never supposed to know
any of this.
Everybody knows Newt only
kept me around because...
Newt, why did you keep me around?
Because I like you.
Because you're my friend.
<i>And I'll never forget
how you helped me, Jacob.</i>
I'll come with you.
We'll go somewhere. We'll go anywhere.
I ain't never gonna
find anyone like you.
There's loads like me.
There's only one like you.
I gotta go.
It's okay.
It's just like waking up, right?
Sorry.
<i>Dear Mr. Kowalski.</i>
<i>You are wasted in a canning factory.</i>
<i>Please take these Occamy eggshells
as collateral for your bakery.</i>
<i>A well-wisher.</i>
I wanted to thank you.
What on earth for?
If you hadn't said all those nice
things to Madam Picquery about me,
I wouldn't be back on the
investigative team now.
I can't think of anyone that
I'd rather have investigating me.
Try not to need investigating for a bit.
I will.
A quiet life for me from now on.
Back to the Ministry.
Deliver my manuscript.
I'll look out for it.
<i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.</i>
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?
Who?
The girl whose picture you carry.
I don't really know what
Leta likes these days.
'Cause people change.
I've changed.
I think.
Maybe a little.
I'll send you a copy
of my book, if I may.
I'd like that.
I'm so sorry. How would you feel
if I gave you your copy in person?
I'd like that.
Very much.
Where'd you get your
ideas from, Mr. Kowalski?
I don't know.
They just come.
Here you go. Don't forget this.
Enjoy.
Hendry.
Storage, all right? Thanks, pal.
