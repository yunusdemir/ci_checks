'Wallace. Whatever you saw,
there's an explanation.
'I'm not saying it's a good explanation.
'It's obviously a bad explanation.
But we can't just leave things like this.
'You have to call me back, OK? Wallace,
whatever happened, I still love you.'

<i>#</i> I'm tired of walking on my own

Yeah, that was supposed to be
an anonymous fridge-magnet poem.
- And here I am, quietlyjudging you.
- Oh, I can handle it.
I've humiliated myself much more thoroughly
in front of people I actually know.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

(# RICH AUCOIN: "Brian Wilson Is A.L.l.V.E.)
I'm sorry, I moved your poem.
- I find this weirdly addictive.
- (Wallace) Yeah, like face tattoos.
(Chantry) Like peeing in the ocean.
- Ah!
- Here it is. Here it is.
Hi.
- Oh, did you guys meet?
- Er... kind of, yeah.
- Wallace, this is my cousin Chantry.
- Hi.
Chantry, this is
my college roommate Wallace.
- You're Wallace.
- Yep.
This is the first time he's been outside
in, like, a year.
Wow! Hey, you do look pale.
I just assumed
you were anaemic or partially albino.
It's both, actually.
He's been hibernating
like an adorable little bear cub
because of his broken head.
Please stop telling people that
and stroking my face.
(Chuckles)
- Anyway, er...
- Hey! Do you guys know Becky?
She said she was coming here
to try and suck some guy Allan's cock.
If I could find his cock
I could probably find her.
- I'm Allan.
- Oh...
I know his cock.
I don't see her here right now.
- But maybe together we could find her.
- OK.
Do you want me to give you a tour? Come.
- <i>Si.</i>
- <i>Entrada.</i>
To be fair, er...
I don't always like parties either.
Awkward small-talk is not my forte.
It's “fort“ actually.
“Forte“ is Italian, it means forcefully.
And “fort“ is French for strength.
But I still say “forte“ too,
because if you say “fort“
everyone thinks you're getting it wrong,
even though it is the correct pronunciation.
So is that, like, your thing?
Correcting people's pronunciation?
- Yeah, that's my thing.
- How's it going for you?
I have a dead-end job,
I live in my sister's attic,
and I basically never go out.
Er... correcting pronunciation
is my old thing.
Actually, my new thing is over-sharing.
- Here, try some of Allan's beer.
- Thank you.
OK, but wait, just back up a second.
- Er... you sewed up your own hand?
- I did.
My parents kept a suture kit
under the bathroom sink.
Oh, because they're serial killers?
Closer than you think, actually.
They're surgeons.
- Oh, God!
- Speaking of which, who do you think
has, on average, a higher body count:
a mediocre surgeon
or an exceptional serial killer?
You're right.
If your parents ever killed anyone,
I'm sure it was completely by accident.
Technically, it's known
as medical negligence.
Oh, right!
So, er... I've gotta go to the bathroom.
Do you need anything, like some dental floss
or, you know, an expired aspirin?
Er... no, but I've left a matchbox in there
and I was hoping that all the women here
could just leave one pubic hair in it.
Er... I'll just go around
with, like, a pally tray.
No, no, no, they'll be in there.
It'll be fine. I'm stuffing a pillow.
(Chantry) OK.
(# HAE RTS: "Wings")
- Oh... hey!
- Oh, hi!
I was just, er... leaving
without saying goodbye, like a dick.
Yeah. Yeah...
That's totally what... I am doing as well.
Where do you...?
Oh, er... I'm just, like,
a couple blocks west.
Me too. Would you like to walk together?
Er... yeah, sure.
Cool.
I read in the tabloids that she's a cannibal
and he faked Parkinson's to get attention.
- I read that too. Crazy.
- Isn't that unbelievable?
Awful people, really.
- Er... this is actually me here, so...
- Oh! Right, er...
Well... hey, I had a really good time
talking to you.
Yeah, me too, which is rare actually.
I'm... usually not that social, so...
Well, er... maybe you'd like
to talk again sometime?
- Yeah, definitely. We should hang out.
- Yeah, it'd be lovely.
- OK. So, I'm gonna give you my number.
- OK. I will...
- Top secret.
- Good.
- I did not mean to stay out so late.
- No, me neither.
My boyfriend will be worried
about, er... what happened to me.
- So... you know, call me.
- Yes. Thank you very much, er...
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Cool.
- Good night.
Good night.

was in a cage too small

- (Ellie) OW!
- You all right?
- I just dropped an earring.
Your dinner's in the oven.
- Good night.
- What time will you be home?
If the date is good, midnight.
If the date is bad, eight.
Er... no treats, OK?
And no horror movies.
And don't let him go up on the roof.
And don't sell his organs
on the black market.
OK, I'm off!
Take care. Have fun. Good luck!

All right, mate, close your eyes.

OK, you can open them again.

Thank you.

(Narrator) "'As you wish"

Thank you.
(Beeps horn) Hey! You need a ride?
- Oh...
- Oh, hey!
Hey! Er... no, I think we're OK.
Thanks, yeah.
Sorry, I didn't see you there.
I also didn't see you
standing right next to me.
- Hi, Wallace.
- Chantry?
- Yes. I'm here alone.
- Me too.
My boyfriend was supposed to come,
but he had to work late, so...
I like seeing movies by myself, though.
I think it's, er... really cool
you're here alone.
- Oh, yeah, it's super cool.
- Yeah.
(Chantry) Seriously?
(Wallace) Yeah, seriously.
Wallace, I don't think
you can have "Princess Bride"
as one of your favourite movies
if you actually think
love makes you a worse person.
Well, no, it's irrelevant.
"The Princess Bride" is a fairy tale.
In fairy tales love inspires you
to be noble and courageous.
But in real life love is just
an all-purpose excuse for selfish behaviour.
You can lie and cheat and hurt people
and it's all OK cos you're in love.
I don't know if you are actually cynical
or just a super-crazy, romantic cheeseball.
You did go see "Princess Bride" by yourself
on a weeknight like a total loser.
Yeah, well... your boyfriend ditched you
and you still came all by yourself.
- So who's the real loser?
- Are you hungry?
I can't believe you ordered
deep-fried pickles.
Pickles are disgusting.
Pickling is, like, embalming, basically.
A pickle jar is, like, a tomb for cucumbers.
I violated a tremendous amount of corpses
in medical school
so I know that pickling
is not the same as embalming.
- You're a doctor?
- Er... no, med-school drop-out.
All right.
The whole premise of deep-frying is
it makes everything taste better.
I don't like deep-fried food.
- What, you don't like French fries?
- Blergh.
- Onion rings? Fried chicken?
- Nope.
- Fish and chips?
- Gross.
Funnel cakes? Doughnuts?
Deep-fried banana sandwiches?
- No, but Elvis ate those.
- And something called Fool's Gold.
- What is that?
- I don't know exactly.
But I read on the internet
that Elvis died
with 40 lb of undigested faeces
still in his intestine.
Thank you so much for telling me that
in the middle of dinner.
You're welcome.
Maybe the next time I take a bite
you can say diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea.
Is that something you learn
in medical school?
- Yeah. In fact they go through the...
- All the famous people?
All the famous people
and how much faeces were left in them
at the time of their death.
- Marie Antoinette?
- Tons.
In fact, they had to guillotine
her intestine as well as her head.
Yeah. They just, like, moved the body
further along through the machine.
Who do you think weighs the faeces?
I think as the King
it would have been a job
that people fought for.
Mm-hmm.
Well, if I can't dress him, if I can't
make him look pretty for the open casket,
can I at least touch his poop?
Do you think he kept a little bit?
I'm sure he did,
in a matchbox or something, yeah.
Or like one of those little vials
and you can wear it around your neck.
Oh, yeah.
He had, like, a little shit locket.
Yeah, yes.
So, like, I've been with Ben for five years.
And, like...
I totally get that guys don't wanna hang out
with the girl with the boyfriend.
But it just sucks, you know?
It just makes you feel like
the only thing that's interesting about you
is how you look with your clothes off.
I mean, it should be easier to make friends
if you have a boyfriend
- because there's no confusion.
- Er...
So is that it?
That's your big pitch to be my friend?
- Er...
- That was terrible.
Yeah, I know, I know. It's just...
I practised in the mirror and...
(Sighs)
- Anyway...
- Friends?
- Yeah, why not? Friends.
- All right.
Is this always how you make friends?
Like it's a business deal?
Yeah, actually.
It's just my style.
All right, it's quite unnerving
but it's good.
"What's shakin', hotpants?"
You can't write,
"What's shakin', hotpants?".
Have you seen anyone wearing hotpants
in the last five years?
That homeless man
who shouts at people at the pool.
(Ping)
(Wallace) So I found this website
where they explain
what Fool's Gold is.
'You take a loaf of Italian white bread.
'You coat it in butter and bake it.'
(Oven pings)
(Wallace) 'Then, you hollow out
the inside...
'and coat it with an entire jar
of peanut butter
'and an entire jar of jam.
'Then, you stuff it
with a pound of crispy bacon.
'The website said it serves
eight to ten people or one Elvis.'
You know, a jar of peanut butter
has, like, 6,000 calories in it.
And bacon is not even a food.
Technically, it's just pure fat.
Champion beefcake at Hotmail dot com.
Re: Just pure fat.
I can't confirm how much faeces
were in Elvis's colon when he died,
but I did find out
how he discovered Fool's Gold.
They get on the jet, a private jet,
fly to Denver, get to Denver,
order Fool's Gold sandwiches
to be delivered to the plane, eat them,
fly back to Graceland
without ever getting off the plane.
WOW!
And the best pan is...
February 1st, 1976.
The day my parents got married.
- Oh, no! Wallace!
- Come on!
(Chantry) Coming!
(Wallace) Mail storm!

If it starts dirty, it ends dirty.
A relationship that starts with a break-up
is doomed to end with a break-up.
- Remember who said that?
- Me.
You, after Vicky Cardero gave me a blow-job
at her boyfriend's keg-party
- and I wanted to ask her out on a date.
- And I recall you ignored that advice.
What was the result?
It ended dirty,
gonorrhoea and a fist fight dirty.
But this is not gonorrhoea and a fist fight.
I'm not trying to break them up.
I just...
I'm happy just being friends with her.
Is this a good housewarming gift for Nicole?
Why are you buying her a housewarming gift?
She's moving into your house.
Well, girls are weird about this son
of stuff and I'd rather overcompensate.
How much for the flying moose?
This dinner is a terrible idea.
Normally, I wouldn't care
about you tumbling into some mess
with a girl and her boyfriend.
I'd even rejoice
at the statistically tiny but mathematically
possible chance of a threesome.
But this is my cousin.
I accidentally saw her labia one time.
Immediately, explosive diarrhoea.
Oh, but you are misreading
this whole situation
because you can't interact with a woman
without sex screwing it up.
But I can because I'm a grown up.
It's so adorable
that you really believe that.
More importantly,
if this was your bedside lamp,
do you think the warm glow would make
you feel more sexually experimental?
- Absolutely.
- What do you think?
I've got the same one at home.
(Dalia) It's like the worst thing that's
ever happened in all of human history.
Was it even worse than when that meteor
hit the Earth and killed all the dinosaurs?
Yes, my break-up is definitely worse
than a stupid meteor.
I just can't believe
that Rob cheated on you.
- With a grad student.
- No, I know...
Her thesis is probably
on how to be a rat-faced whore.
- And I really liked him. I'm so sorry.
- I liked him so much,
I don't even wanna sleep
with all of his friends to get back at him.
I mean, I will but I'm not gonna enjoy it.
Do you think there might be a slightly less
skanky option for rebounding?
- No. This is something you have to do.
- (Knock on door)
I'm just gonna go
cos I don't wanna wreck your dinner party.
No, no, it's not a dinner party.
It's just, like, my friend, Wallace.
Stay. This Wallace guy
could be a good rebound for you.
OK.
Please go easy on him.
He's delicate.
- Hi!
- (Wallace) Hi. Hey.
- Thank you.
- I brought booze.
- That's so nice.
- You're welcome.
- You can take your coat off.
- I will. Thank you very much.
- Wow, this place is just like I imagined.
- Really?
Well, I mean...
Yeah, I pictured more potpourri and doilies
and stuffed animals and things...
Yeah, I put all that stuff away.
I know that it weirds you out.
Ben, Wallace is here.
- Hi.
- Hey, Wallace. How are you?
Hi.
Oh! Sorry.
- No, no worries.
- Let me dry off my hands.
- Take your time.
- Thanks for coming by.
No, nice to meet you, man.
Thank you.
<i>_</i> Hey, everybody.
- Hey.
Oh, er... Wallace, this is my sister, Dalia.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- You smell really good.
- Really?
Yeah, or I don't know,
maybe it just smells really bad in here.
No, he smells great.
But it is getting kind of oniony in here.
- Can someone open the window?
- Yeah. I'll... I'll get it.
(Chantry) Right over there.
So, Wallace, I'd like
to get your opinion on something.
- Er... yeah.
- Europe.
The... the... the continent?
_ See?
' (Ben) Is it?
- Is it?
- (Chantry) Yes, it is a continent.
- (Ben) Is it really a continent?
- It is a continent.
He is from that continent.
He should know.
OK, look at a map, any map.
Europe's not a separate continent.
- It's clearly pan of Asia.
- Right... but wait.
So, if Europe isn't a continent,
then why is it a continent?
Because Europeans were the ones
who decided what the continents are
and they didn't want to get lumped in
with all the, er... you know, Asians.
Now, wait!
Hold on, you work for the UN, don't you?
- So, what do they say about it?
- Before I answer that question
you need to understand
the UN is not an organisation
- designed to challenge conventional wisdom.
- OK, so it is a continent.
Yeah, well, people knew
the world was flat
for a lot longer
than they knew it was round.
Ben is trying to change the world
from the inside out.
- From within.
- (Wallace) All right.
OK, Eurasia.
That's what they should call it.
- Europe plus Asia. Eurasia.
- (Wallace) OK.
Who wants more wine?
(Ben) Yes, please.
(Chantry) I do, please. Here's my glass.
And so, er... Ben, what is it exactly
that you do at the UN?
I'm part of an international consortium
of lawyers with a UN mandate
- to negotiate global copyright standards.
- Wow!
But more importantly,
are you trying to sleep with my girlfriend?
(Girls chat)
Oh, don't worry.
We're just talking "guy", OK?
They think we're still talking
about international copyright law.
OK.
Now, look, I've no problem with the concept
of Chantry having guy friends
but if you're trying to split us up
- so you can move in...
- No, God, I wouldn't do that.
I just want to be friends with her,
and with you.
Friends is fine, OK?
I can do friends.
But you'd better not try
and put your penis in her vagina, OK?
OK.
Every country has different laws,
so it's a logistical nightmare.
But I think it's important work.
You know, I think it's worth it.
Yeah, that... that is impressive,
very impressive.
Aargh! Aargh!
- (Screams)
- Oh, shit!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, my God! My eye!
- What is it?
- Jesus...
He's just rubbed his eye.
God! My eye, it's really burning.
- Did you cut the jalapefio?
- Yeah, I did.
- Oh, my...
- Oh, God!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
OK! Er... Wallace, medical school.
What do we do?
OK... well, do you have saline solutions?
Do you have... do you use contacts?
- Yes. Ben wears contacts.
- (Ben) I do. It's in the bathroom.
- (Wallace) OK. Where?
- The bathroom! Through that door.
- Oh, God, that's painful.
- OK, what can I do, honey?
(Ben) God! That burns so badly!
It's on that rag
and it's in the other eye now!
(Chantry) I'm sorry!
- Over there!
- (Retching)
(Chantry) Oh, my God! Ben? Ben!
(Wallace) Oh, shit!
_ Oh' my God!
_ Ben? '
- Are you OK?
- (Ben groans)
(Chantry) OK, don't move! Ben!
- Do something!
- Call 911!
I am! Oh...
(Chantry) Oh, no! OK, stay right there!
Don't move!
(Ben groans)
(Wallace) I'm sorry! You look fine.
(Ben) Ow! It hurts me!
It hurts me!
- Just be still.
- What if I'm paralysed?
You're not paralysed.
I'm just gonna give you something
for the pain here to help you relax.
OK, what if I relax too much?
What if I lose control
of my bodily function?
What if I shit myself?
You know, that actually happens
more than you think.
It's the worst pan of my job.
It's super gross.
Here we go.
(Ben groans)
- (Paramedic) And that'll do.
- OK, just lie still. Ssh...
- Should you really be eating?
- Stress makes me hungry.
That's why I could never be a fighter pilot.
I'd weigh, like, 500 lb.
I wouldn't even be able
to fit in the cockpit.
- (Hums "Silent Night")
- Ssh.
(All join in the humming)
So, what's the prognosis, doc?
He'll need the cast for a few more weeks,
but, er... the neck brace is a precaution.
And he'll probably be out in the morning.
Well, Chantry, if you're gonna spend
the night, I can wait here with Ben.
You guys get something to eat.
(Chantry) What are you getting?
Tuna salad? Yeah.
- I hate hospitals.
- Mmm... me too.
I spent a lot of time in hospitals
as a child.
Because of all your deformities?
- No, my parents met as surgical interns.
- Right.
He does cardiology,
she does oﬂhopaedics.
He actually proposed to her on the roof
of Charing Cross Hospital in London.
- That's romantic.
- Yeah, until the affairs.
She cheated on him, he cheated on her.
It was just a mess.
- How old were you when they got divorced?
- Er... seven, I think.
Oh, er... you don't know
how to telepoﬂ, do you?
- No.
- OK, well then, I just want to apologise
for the horribly awkward situation
you're about to witness.
Hi. Er... sorry, Chantry.
This is Megan, my, er...
- Well, my nothing in paﬂicular.
- Nice to meet you.
Wallace, what are you doing here?
Are you sick?
Oh, er... Chantry's boyfriend fell
out of a window. But he's... he's OK.
- Do you want me to look in on him?
- No, that won't be necessary.
I'm gonna go.
We only get 15 minutes to eat lunch.
Don't get the bagel with smoked salmon
or the tuna salad
or really anything with seafood in it.
The company that stocks
the vending machine
has failed four health inspections
but the manager's brother
works for the mayor's office.
I'm sorry.
I've been on shift for 18 hours and
I'm really tired and I had so much coffee
and when I saw her,
I thought maybe that was your
new girlfriend and that made me wanna cry.
It's weird that I'm saying
this out loud, right?
You are and it is.
I just want us to be friends.
Not today but someday.
Whatever he said about me,
it wasn't a black and white situation.
He hasn't said anything about you.
He's never even mentioned you.
Er... OK, it was nice to meet you.
- I hope your boyfriend feels better.
- Thank you.
- That was my ex-girlfriend.
- Yeah.
Dude, you're really finger-banging me
over this new manual.
- Is finger-banging good or bad?
- Do you enjoy being finger-banged?
No, I've never been finger-banged.
- Take a guess.
- Probably not.
Definitely not.
Nobody wants to get finger-banged.
All those girls you finger-banged
in high school, they didn't like it.
They just wouldn't have sex with me,
er... you. Us... men. Men.
- I'm off topic.
- God, I hope so.
Er... yeah, manual.
Er... it needs a lot of work,
so I'll give you another week, er... month.
An extra month.
So make it, er... make it right.
(Sighs)
(Chantry) Hang on a second.
Seriously, Josh.
This is where we're doing it?
With the wood?
Cos I think it might be cleaner
someplace else.
- You're blocking the shot, so...
- Oh, sorry.
- Keep going, Josh!
- Douche.
It is total bullshit that Josh got
the project manager job over you.
Everyone knows
the whole thing is your design
and now Josh is acting like it's all his.
- It's, like, sexism or something.
- Our boss is a woman.
Oh, I am so pissed that I gave Josh
a hand-job after the Christmas party.
In your defence,
it is kind of your annual tradition
to give one of our co-workers
a handsy for Christmas.
Ssh!
Listen, guys, Holly offered me
the promotion first. I turned it down.
(Both) What? Why?
- Because I like being an animator.
- (Both scoff)
I do, and a project manager
has to deal with so much more hassle
and paperwork and meetings.
And Josh is gonna end up
stuck in Taiwan half the year.
Uh-huh, and the extra power and money
and travel is really gonna suck for him.
Stop! She doesn't want the hassle, OK?
She's got a great job, a great boyfriend,
great friends like me... kind of you.
She's happy just the way things are, right?
Right.
- Servings per pack, about 107.
- Oh, about?
- About.
- Oh, OK.
Just in case you wanna eat all of it
in one sitting.
That is not a good idea.
Please don't. Please don't eat it all.
I want to know where the weird shit is.
Like, where are the animal pans
that you think are trash
but are actually...
Chantry?
I've been waiting for the right moment
to, er... talk to you about this,
but I think maybe it's better
just to stop building it up and just say it.
- OK... ls everything OK?
- Oh, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Er... OK, so we've been together five years
and it feels like our relationship
is built to last,
no matter what the future holds.
I've been asked to take charge
of the European negotiation.
It's a six-month contract, er... but
the thing is, the team is based in Ireland,
so I would have to live in Dublin,
although I'd have to travel
round the whole, er... continent.
You mean the subcontinent,
but that's OK.
Right.
Look, this is important to me, but
there is nothing more important than you,
so if you feel like, er...
the long-distance thing is too much,
- I'll turn it down.
- This is a huge opportunity for you, right?
Lead negotiator!
(Ben) I love you.
(Chantry) I love you.
(Shouts)
Dude, I'm not saying you can't eat it.
I'm saying you'd get horribly sick.
But it wouldn't kill you.
You can eat your own poop.
But if you eat the poop that you poop out
after eating the first poop,
it's so toxic you'll die.
So you can eat your poop once
but not twice.
- (Shouts)
- (Nicole) Excuse me.
OK, where did you get beer
at a children's karate tournament?
(Mimics Wallace) Where did you get beer
at a children's karate tournament?
So, Wallace, we should
get to know each other better,
talk about the complex issues of our time:
gay marriage, abortion.
Can men and women really be friends
or do you secretly wanna bang Chantry?
- Thank you. She has a boyfriend.
- Yeah, who you threw out a window.
- By accident!
- Dude, listen.
Ben is moving to Dublin
and your whole “if it starts dirty,
it ends dirty“ thing is bullshit anyways.
The night I met Allan,
I was so into him it wasn't till I woke up
in his bed the next morning
that I even remembered
I already had a boyfriend.
Love is dirty, baby.
Sometimes it's downright filthy.
- Like eating your own poop.
- Like eating my poop?
Christ.
Hey.
I need to wear something
to this company dinner
with our production partners
from Taiwan.
- What do you think?
- I think that's quite a dress.
(Whispers) Do you think
it's, like, a little too slutty for me?
No, nothing is too slutty for you.
- Can I help you?
- Er... yeah, actually.
Er... I would like to try on that dress.
We only have the one left
and it's a size two. Are you a two?
Yes.
- I'm gonna get the measuring tape.
- I'm a two.
(G roans)
(Sighs)
(G roans)
(Ripping)
(Ripping)
(squeals)
(Whispers) Wallace? Wallace!
- Yes?
- Er... are you alone?
- Like, in the universe?
- No! In the hallway!
- Er... yes.
- OK, er...
- Do you need me to get someone?
- No, no! Don't get anyone.
I need you to come in here.
What?
I'm kinda stuck, so I need you
to crawl under, but keep your eyes closed.
Really? Er...
I am in a state of undress! You need
to close your eyes and keep them closed.
Do you promise to close your eyes
and keep them closed?
- Yes, I promise.
- Hurry!
(Sighs)
Ow!
What? Did you open your eyes?
No, I just banged my head
cos my eyes are closed.
OK, so, here's what happened.
I tried it on
and I think it got hooked on my bra
or something and now I can't get it off.
- Right.
- You're not gonna laugh, are you?
- I can't even see what's going on.
- OK.
OK, er...
- Are your eyes closed?
- Yes.
I think you need to move a bit.
There, yeah.
(Wallace breathes deeply)
- (Chantry squeals)
- All right? Are you all right?
No, it's stuck, it's stuck.
OK, OK. Tell you what,
turn around, turn to me.
Yeah, OK.
- Thank you.
- It's OK.
Shall I hold that?
Here, hold this.
And keep your eyes closed.
Oh, I love you so much
I wanna just rip off your arms and legs
and carry you around in my purse all day.
And I love you so much I wanna grind up
your muscles and organs and bones
and spread you on toast.
Oh, I love you so much, I wanna just
cut you open and scoop all your insides
and wear your skin around town
like an Allan-suit.
- OK. Bye, Wallace.
- Bye, Nicole.
- (Nicole) Ciao!
- (Oven pings)
Can I talk to you about something?
I just had sex.
I'm about to eat nachos.
It's the greatest moment of my life.
Unless you screw it up
with whatever it is you're about to say.
- It's about your cousin...
- She's my cousin. It's like incest.
- Well, she's not my cousin.
- Yeah, but you're like my brother
so it's like my brother asking my advice
on how to incestuously bang my cousin.
No, I'm not...
She... well, she has a boyfriend.
Yeah...
He's been coming over for Thanksgiving
and Christmas for the past five years.
OK, let me break it down for you.
This perfect nacho chip is Ben.
He works at the United Nations
as an expert in international copyright law.
This mouldy banana is you.
I have no idea what you do, because
every time you tell me, I fall asleep.
You know I write user manuals
for dedicated purchasing software...
- (Snores)
- OK, like copyright law is so exciting!
At least he's an expert in something.
What are you an expert in? Nothing.
"There are no people anywhere in the world
seeking my advice on any subject."
Ben's been dating Chantry for five years.
They live together.
They own furniture, they have a cat.
You have nothing,
you don't even have a plant.
You've been single since that douche-bag
Megan broke your fragile little heart.
OK, OK... I broke up with Megan, all right?
She wanted to stay together and work it out.
I said no, so I dumped her.
Of course you did.
Anyway, <i>I</i> get n. n: fine.
She's in a relationship.
Nothing's gonna happen.
You totally killed my sex-nacho high.
So...
Wallet...
Passport, phone, keys, wallet,
and yes... this.
It's an open ticket to Dublin.
It's a five-hour flight.
It's already paid for
so use it whenever you want.
Even if it's just for a weekend,
even if it's just for a day.
Even if it's just for a kiss.
- OK?
- Mm-hmm.
(Horn)
Uh-uh. No, baby, I gotta go. The cab's here.
I'm so sorry. I can't miss my flight.
OK, I'm so late. OK?
OK, baby?
Good bye.
- Love you.
- Love you too. Bye.

You'd love Dublin, though.
They've got us all staying

so the whole office

But I've already made some good friends.
It's nice but I just...
You know, I miss you so much.
Yeah, I know.
I really miss you too.
Look, I gotta go, OK?
I love you.
- OK.
- 'See ya.'
- OK.
- 'All right, speak tonight.'
- All right, I'll talk to you then.
- 'Bye-bye.'
Bye .
- Sorry.
- No worries. Black for you, milk for me.
Cheers.
- On!
_ Yep.
So, is Ben settling in OK?
Yeah, he's great. He's doing great
and he's having a great time.
Are you having a great time?
Not really.
I'm having kind of a crappy time, actually.
. SorfV-
<i>_</i> YeP-
This, right now, this is the high point
of my social calendar.
- Oh! See, that is sad.
- I know.
I've been thinking
about just starting drinking.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Heavily?
- Heavily.
Do you need someone
to start drinking with you?
- I'm very... very willing.
- Really?
Do you wanna help me
drown my sorrows?
- Of course. Absolutely.
- Done!
(# PETE TONG:
"H.OS.H. Woohoo ft. OST & KJEX")
(Wallace) Bottoms up!
- Ohh! Oh, my God!
- Ohh! Horrible.
- Horrible and cheap!
- As always!
All right, prospective person
at this bar for you!
I don't think anyone I'd actually like
would ever come to a place like this.
- You're here, Wallace!
- Yeah, because you dragged me here.
So? Look at this girl!
She's so pretty!
Oh? Er... yeah.
- Yeah! No, she's super-pretty.
- Er... OK.
You want me to go tell her
that you have six nipples?
Yeah... No, you know what?
I'll do it myself.
It will be easier coming from me.
- Thank you.
- (Barman) You're welcome.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, wow!
You've got amazing teeth.
Er... sorry.
Can I buy this drink for you?
Er... yeah, that's so sweet.
Thank you.
You're welcome, er... So...
Burn!
All right.
Weirdest place you've ever had sex?
Er... bakery, night shift.
(Wallace) 'l will never be comfoﬂable
eating a cupcake again.'
What about you?
Er... Ferris wheel.
'Trapped at the very top.
We could see for miles around.
'But no one could see us.'
- Ah!
<i>'</i> Yes!
Oh, yeah!
Thank you
for being so gracious in victory.
- Woo! Uh-huh!
- Hand clasp of champions.
Rub it in.
(# "H.OS.H. Woohoo ft. OST & KJEX"

So, how many serious relationships
have you actually had?
Four! Two in high school,
one in college before Ben and then Ben.
_ You?
<i>'</i> Six?
One in high school,
one the summer after high school,
three in college and one since.
No, sorry, two since.
So... seven.
- Are you usually a dumper or a dumpee?
- Er...
Statistically, I'm a dumper,
but it's not like I've never been dumped.
I've just been really good
at knowing when to get out.
You?
No, I've never dumped anyone.
I always try to make it work.
You know, I haven't hit the bar scene
in, like, a very long time.
I thought it was going to be
the worst thing ever,
but that was surprisingly painless.
I'm just sorry you didn't find
true love tonight.
Nah, well, you can't have it all.
And what's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?
Er... the worst thing
that's ever happened to me
is kind of the best thing
that's ever happened to me.
'Megan, who you met the other day.
'I burst in on her making out
with our, frankly, gross anatomy professor.
'And I was like... "Wow!
"'We actually are my parents.
"'We are almost both doctors
and we're already cheating on each other.“
So I got out of there and yeah...
So, in a way, that became
the best thing that ever happened to me.
So, what is the worst thing
that ever happened to you?
My Mum died
when I was in junior high.
Er... she had breast cancer.
You don't realise how quickly
everything can fall apart until it does.
It makes you never want to give up
anything good ever again.
Can I change my answer?
Because the worst thing
that ever happened to me
is saying my lame relationship drama
is the worst thing that ever happened to me
when something really awful
happened to you.
It's OK. I like your answer.
Plus I get to be pan
of the worst pan of your life now.
That's really good.
And for future reference,
when the answer is your mum died of cancer,
you should really go first.
All right.
Thanks for the etiquette lesson.
No worries.
Good night, Wallace.
Good night, Chantry.
(Chantry) You know, he has
all these new experiences,
he's meeting all these new people.
And then he's like,
"What's going on with you?"
And it's like...
"Well, I'm in the middle of my same old life
"except, whoops,
my boyfriend is out of the country."
(Dalia) Oh!
So, Dalia was telling us
about this Wallace guy?
We're friends.
No, I know. Obviously, you guys are friends.
But is he cute?
Should you maybe be introducing him
to your single,
slightly desperate friends, like me?
- No, I already called dibs on him.
- Why?
Because he was supposed
to be my rebound after Rob.
I think that's why
it didn't work out with Noel.
I needed a buffer between Rob and Noel.
- A buffer made of sex.
- (Gretchen) You little prostitute!
- Dalia, you barely know him.
- Well, you know him.
You hang out with him all the time,
so he's not a loser.
I mean, he hasn't made some creepy move
on you, so we know he's not a creep.
- He's vetted.
- (Tabby) Well, is he funny? Or smaﬂ?
He's definitely smart
He's not funny.
He's kind of like bantery.
He's kind of like a male version of Chantry.
- Wait, so he's Mantry?
- (Tabby) Oh, no!
(Dalia) Yes, he is.
(Gretchen and Tabby) He is a Mantry!
(Tabby) Dalia wants to have rebound sex
with her sister's man-twin.
(Allan) Option one: make a move on her.
Bold, direct.
If you're lucky, you hook up.
She feels guilty, breaks up with Ben.
If you're unlucky, she's furious,
ends the friendship.
- So be sleazy?
- Yeah.
- And you think that'll work?
- No.
I think even if she goes for it, she'll
resent you for getting her to cheat on Ben.
She'll break up with him, but
she won't go outwith you because you're...
- Sleazy.
- Yeah.
Option two:
be the guy she goes to for advice.
The down-side is you have to listen to her
talk about Ben all the time.
The up-side is, you can slant your advice
to slowly turn her against him.
- So be conniving?
- Yeah.
And that'll work?
Maybe, but maybe she'll see through it
and think you're...
- Conniving?
- Yeah.
Option three: patiently wait it out.
Eventually, either the distance gets to them
and they break up
or it doesn't and they get married,
live a happy life,
with you always on the outside
looking in, quietly pining, indefinitely.
- So be pathetic?
- Yeah.
That sounds fun.
Well, it's got the advantage
of not being paﬂicularly unethical,
but it's got the disadvantage
of being, you know...
- Pathetic.
- Yeah.
So your advice is be sleazy,
conniving or pathetic?
Well, when you put it that way,
it doesn't sound like very good advice.
Ooh...
Oh, my God! Do you like it?
Er... well, it's not my engagement ring.
It's whether she'll like it.
I think she'll love it.
Then you're made for each other.
Why did you get all snaky
when we were talking about Wallace earlier?
L---
Come on.
Look, you're just like...
You don't have the greatest track record
with guys, that's all.
You think I'm gonna break his heart
and mess up your friendship?
No...
So you think I'm not good enough for him?
Obviously not.
That's obviously not what it is.
OK, well, some of us aren't
as lucky as you and Ben.
Some of us just want a guy that doesn't
make us feel like crap all the time.
- There is a fourth option.
- Yeah?
Be honest, tell her how you feel.
It might ruin the friendship,
but at least you stood up like a man
and expressed your feelings.
Wait, I'm sorry...
Since when does being a man
involve expressing your feelings?
I mean, did I miss a memo?
Because if I recall, being a man
meant hiding your feelings forever.
Like Bruce Willis. You never see
Bruce Willis expressing his feelings.
The most you ever get out of Bruce is
a hint of melancholy at the edge of a smirk.
And do you think Bruce Willis
would be happyjust being friends?
100% honesty is the foundation
of any relationship.
- Whoa! You are 100% honest with Nicole?
- Yes.
- About everything?
- Yep!
What, New Orleans 2006?
What was her name, er... Favia?
Yeah, she did look like a woman to be fair.
99% honesty is the foundation
of any relationship.
No, it's not worth the risk,
not if it means losing her as a friend.
- Well, so then it's option five.
- What's that?
You move on.
Hello.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
Hello, welcome.
Welcome to our engagement party.
We are so happy to have everybody
we care about together in one space.
Here's the thing.
We both really wanna get married, but...
But we hate weddings cos every wedding
I've ever been to has completely sucked.
Sorry, er... Aunt Cathy,
Uncle Drew and Olivia.
And we don't like long engagements,
so we are getting married here, tonight.
Zella is our registered civil officiate.
(Nicole) Oh, and, er... Mum,
I got your wedding dress altered.
I hope that's OK.
Becky's gonna be Nicole's maid of honour.
- Wallace!
- Here!
Is gonna be my best man.
Thank you very much.
Everyone, stay away from my Uncle Herman!
Woo-hoo!
OK. I don't need
you finger-combing my wisps. I'm serious.
- (Knock on door)
- (Wallace) Nicole?
- I've been sent to get an ETA.
- Oh, is that Wallace?
- Yes.
- Just come in.
- Oh, wow! You look amazing.
- Yes. Becky, seriously!
If I don't get, er... some alcohol,
I'm gonna have a panic attack.
- All right, I'll go.
- No, no, no! You stay.
Becky's more nervous than I am
and frankly, it's wigging me out. Now, go.
You, stay, talk to me.
" So?
" So?
- So?
- What?
Why are you torturing yourself
over what could be a ten-second conversation
with Chantry that would answer everything?
Nicole, please, it's your wedding day.
Can we talk about you?
Exactly! It's my wedding day.
As best man,
it's your job to keep me calm
so that I don't crawl out that window
and go and bang a sailor.
- Where are you even gonna find a sailor?
- At the dock.
God! What's the best-case scenario?
"Wallace, I love you. Let's have sex forever
until we die having sex."
- That is the best-case scenario.
- OK, and what's the worst-case scenario?
"Wallace, you shit-drizzling liar,
I thought we were friends
“but this whole time you've just been trying
to put your junk inside my trunk.“
Anything involving the phrase
“put your junk inside my trunk“
actually would be the worst-case scenario.
Look, the one thing I like
about getting married
is that you get to stand up
in front of everyone you care about
and state, for the record,
that you believe in the best-case scenario.
It terrifies me.
But that's why the outfits are so nice.
- (Door opens)
- OK.
(Sighs)
- Thanks.
- Cheers.
(# Wedding march)
WOW!
(Allan) I got her.
She's mine, my wife.
(Nicole) Dad!
(Allan) Mummy!
- I can't believe no one stopped that.
- Me neither.
(Sniffles)
And I learnt a lot of <i>lessons</i> that night
about gambling addictions
and identity theft
and the Romanian legal system,
but the most important lesson I learnt
was from Nicole
and it was about friendship.
I love you, Nicole.
- (Drops microphone)
- Oh, so much fun!
- Yay!
- Yay!
She didn't even practise!
(Dalia) Woo! Go, Wallace!
(Chantry) Go, Wallace!
(Wallace) Thank you, thank you.
(Dalia) Woo-hoo!
To those of us
who begrudgingly call Allan a friend,
it seems impossible that any woman
could handle him for an hour,
let alone a lifetime.
And then you meet Nicole.
And that is the good news here.
If these two can find each other,
then there truly is somebody for everyone.
The bad news is
that one day they will procreate
and their hideous offspring
will obviously cause the apocalypse.
But tonight we celebrate the good news.
I remember the night Allan and Nicole met...
...and that instant connection.
You know, if you're lucky,
it happens once in a lifetime.
And if you're unlucky,
then you have to come to weddings
and hear people like me talking about it
and assume that
we are all hopeless romantics.
It's very easy to be cynical about love
but this tonight, this is hard.
Soto Allan and Nicole
for making the hard way look easy.
(All) Cheers!
(Wallace) Cheers.
Right, thanks, everyone.
Yep, that's it.
(# MARSHA HUNT:
"Oh, No! Not The Beast Day")
(indistinct chatter)
Are you sure?
It's... it's so near here for me.
Well, yeah.
No, I'm all about the door-to-door service.
OK.
- Can you let me out?
- Sure.
(Wallace) Er... oh, gosh, German cars.
Good night.
- Wallace, you clean up nice.
- Yes, so do you.
- OK.
- Good night.
(Chantry) Bye!
(Both) Bye.
Great, thank you very much.
Listen, I don't think it's a good idea
for me to come inside with you.
What?
Don't get all mad,
cos, I mean, if you're gonna get mad,
I guess we could make out
for a couple of minutes
but we are not having sex.
Er... no, er...
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
Why? Because I won't have sex with you?
That's really nice, Wallace.
- Er... no, that's not what I meant.
- I know, just kidding.
Oh, right...
What pan are you kidding about?
All of it.
Chantry always talks
about how funny you are,
but you're not that funny, no of fence.
You are pretty cute though.
Like, I would make out with you.
I'm very confused by this conversation.
Fine. Let's go inside.
- Dude, my sister. Sweet score.
- Er... no, this isn't what it looks like.
Look, OK...
Yeah, it is. It is what it looks like.
She's super-hot.
Plus she's, like,
99% genetically identical to me, so...
Anyway, have fun making out with my sister.
Er... actually, just FYI,
if you do go through with this
you're can be pretty much
absolutely positive
I will never, ever, ever, ever
have sex with you, ever!
Ban]!
(Chantry) 'Ever, ever, ever!'
Er... I'm sorry. Sorry, I...
Look, I think... I think you're great,
but, er... I can't do this.
Great? You think I'm great?
I don't...
I don't throw myself at guys, like, ever.
I just made an exception for you
cos I thought you were cute.
And you think I'm great?
- Great?
- Er...
- Get the fuck out!
- Sorry.
- Er...
- God! Get your...
- Get out faster!
- OK, I'm going, I'm going!
I can't believe I got a Brazilian
for this shit!
Good bye!
(Wallace) Jesus!
(Ringing tone)
- (Ben) 'Hello?'
- Whispers) Ben! Hi!
- 'Hi. Er... are you OK?'
- Hi...
'It's like the middle of the night there.'
I'm really good.
I'm really just a little bit drunk.
- 'OK, but...'
- I am wearing such a fancy, fancy dress.
- 'Oh, I see.'
- Er... hang on a second, hang on a second.
- Listen very closely, OK?
- 'Mm-hmm, okey-dokey.'
Really closely.
'But...'
- Did you hear that?
- 'Mm-hmm, I can, but...'
That's the sound of me unzipping
my very, very fancy dress.
'Well, that's good news.'
I happen to be wearing
really cute panties under.
'You are?'
And also, like, a bra
that totally, totally matches.
'Chantry...'
Can you picture me in them?
(Whispers) Hey!
Can you picture me out of them?
I-I-I definitely can.
The thing is, I'm just in the, er...
middle of the Brazilian presentation now.
That's not to say
I, er... don't fully support the concept.
It sounds... sounds very interesting.
And, er... I would love
to continue discussing it at a later time.
OK. I'll... Bye.
(Hangs UP)
Sir.
Please carry on.
- It's good?
- Oh, yeah.
(Dalia) You never asked me
what happened with Wallace the other night.
(Chantry) I'm respecting your privacy.
He's a big, stupid, fat jerk.
I hate him.
OK.
He propositioned me.
He said, like, dirty, disgusting things
he wanted to do to me.
Me, your little sister.
That's so terrible.
I know, and so I told him
I'm not that kind of girl
and he just flew into a rage
and he attacked me.
He tried to break all my fingers
and poke my eyeballs out
so the cops had to come
and pull him off me.
- The cops came?
- Yeah!
And then he just shot them all in the face
and they all died.
And some of them had little kids
and they'll never know their father.
And he didn't even care.
He was just laughing and shooting them all
and he had a huge boner.
And then he said he was gonna come
to your house and kill you,
while you were sleeping.
Yeah, that sounds exactly like Wallace.
- Have you talked to him lately?
- No.
So he didn't say anything about me
completely humiliating myself
in front of him?
No.
He's a big, stupid, ugly jerk and you
shouldn't be friends with him anymore.
OK.
Look how pregnant I can make myself look.
You wanna feel my baby?
It's so hard.
- Oh, my God, it kicked!
- Shut up.
I'm gonna make you raise it.
(Holly) I'm firing Josh.
The Taiwan team hates him,
nobody listens to him.
On the plus side, I hear he's banging
enough Taiwanese girls
to qualify for the douche-bag Olympics.
- So there's a silver lining.
- That's, er... unfortunate.
I need someone full-time in Taiwan
to clean up Josh's mess.
I want it to be you.
I mean, this whole thing is your concept.
If we had had you as project manager
from the start
we'd have saved
a lot of time and money.
Holly, honestly, I just...
I don't even know if I would enjoy
being the project manager, so...
You get an apartment, car,
language lessons, obviously a raise.
I need your answer
by the end of the month.
And to be clear, this is the last time
I offer you a promotion.
OK, I got it.
Holly, er...I'm gonna think about it,
I promise.
(Sighs)
So I was reading this thing
about how, er...
when they were trying to name Cool Whip,
they came up with 10,000 ideas.
Like, they brainstormed 10,000 ideas.
And none of them were as good
as Cool Whip?
No, Cool Whip was the best.
That's what they said.
And they said, just try to think
of ten of your own
just to see, like, er... how hard it is.
- Cool Puff.
- Puffy Whip.
- Creamy Dream.
- Zit Topping.
- Angel Puff.
- Angel Gas.
- Angel Cup.
- Angel Tear Gas.
- Ang...
- Bruce Springs cream and the E-Foam Band.
- Puffin' Lovin'.
- Dump That Puff On My Face.
- Whip-Master Cool and the Puff Brigade.
- Fizz Blizzard.
- Semen Salvation.
- (Nicole) Non-Hodgkin's Cream-Foam-a.
- Shove this Shit on Food.
- Whip, whippy... Whippy Pippitins.
(All laugh)
- So, how many is that?
- I don't know.
- Yeah, it's not that hard.
- No.
- No.
- Let's go swimming.
Ooh-ah!
I didn't bring my suit.
Did you bring your suit?
N000...
(Allan) We should take our clothes off.
(Nicole) Yeah.
- Are you gonna come and get me?
- Yeah!
- (Nicole squeals)
- (Allan) Ow! You're hitting me.
(Allan) It's very warm.
Ooh! It's cold. It's cold. It's cold.
(Sings) It's cooold!
(Nicole) Allan!
Ow, don't!
You wanna go swimming?
Yeah.
(# PATRICK WATSON: "Lighthouse")
- Do you think it'll be cold?
- Yep.
<i>#</i> Leave a lighthouse in the wild
<i>#</i> Cos I'm coming in a little blind
<i>#</i> Dreamer of a lighthouse...
You've got a tattoo.
Yeah.
- Yeah, it's, er...
- Eh, I know, it's...
It's your mum, right?
- Oh, God!
- What?
Something just...
something just touched my foot.
- It was really gross.
- OK.
- (Chantry) It's not funny.
- (Wallace laughs)
Oh...
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, yeah. Wow!
Wallace.
Yes?
I'll look if you look.
OK.
<i>#</i> ...all busy lives
<i>#</i> Dreaming of a lighthouse in the woods
<i>#</i> To help us get back into the world... <i>#</i>
Where are our clothes?
(Wallace) Did we drift fuﬂher down?
(Chantry) No, the fire's right there.
Yeah... they took our clothes.
(Chantry) Oh, God.
The car is gone.
God, how did it get so cold?
It wasn't cold at all before.
It was, like, a warm night.
OK, er... you keep the sleeping bag
and I will figure something out.
No, I can't let you just spend the night
on the sand,
all cold and wet and naked like a walrus.
Do you think that's funny?
Do you think this is, like,
some hilarious prank
played on us by our wacky pals?
- Cos I don't.
- No, I don't.
I just thought you were trying
to lighten the mood
with a mildly amusing joke
involving a walrus.
I'm sorry if I misunderstood
the seriousness of your walrus reference.
- Don't be an arsehole.
- I'm not being an arsehole.
Yes, you are, you are being an arsehole,
because you're not taking this seriously.
You're treating it like a joke
and it's not a joke!
There <i>is</i> a line, a line that should not
be crossed, and they crossed it.
And you know what? Treating it like a joke
is being an arsehole.
I'm not treating this like a joke
and I am not being an arsehole.
Allan is being an arsehole
and Nicole is being an arsehole.
And right now you are
kind of being an arsehole.
Me, I'm standing here with a branch.
A branch that cuts down approximately 0%
of the wind-chill factor on my dick, OK?
I've got a branch,
you've got a sleeping bag.
How does that make me an arsehole?
- Fine.
- Fine? What does "fine" mean?
Fine means we'll share.
- Chantry?
- What?
They brought our clothes back.
I'll never doubt you again.
Hey, you guys have fun last night?
(Allan) Hey.
- Sleep well?
- You're an arsehole.
(Julianne in Spanish) That last bottle
of wine was a terrible idea!
(Ben in Spanish)
Don't worry, we're almost there.
(Julianne in Spanish)
The stairs look like mountains!
(Chantry) Ben.
(Julianne in Spanish) The stairs...
Chantry?
Julianne is part
of the Argentinian negotiating team.
She lives in the apartment next door.
A bunch of us went for a drink after work
and I was just helping her home.
Ben, I'm not accusing you of anything.
You need not worry about his fidelity.
I'm not some beautiful
but morally corrupt Argentine girl.
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming, Chantry?
Because I wanted to surprise you. Surprise!
OK. I need to go to my apartment now
and stuff old socks in my ears
so I don't hear your love-making
through the wall.
And I'm keeping this meat.
(Ben) Good night.
Sorry, you startled me.
This isn't how I planned
to welcome you to Dublin.
Are you still startled?
Should I get you some warm milk?
Welcome to Dublin.
(Allan) I think someone shaded
and it might be Mrs Cole.
Everyone, check.
Check, shad check.
You can look it up on Urban Dictionary.
Fail. You couldn't find that stone
if it was in your kidney.
I can see your back acne
through your blouse.
(Wallace) Look at you just drunkenly
spewing out joy like a shit Santa.
(Allan) Yup.
(Wallace) That's you now, yeah?
Nicole's spending the night at Becky's.
We had a fight.
First fight as a married couple.
- Ta-da! You want a beer?
- Sure.
So, er...
I'm sorry. OK?
I let Nicole talk me into it
even though I knew it was a bad idea.
I'm not like you.
I can't just hook up with somebody
if they're already with someone else.
It's wrong.
It was wrong when my parents did it
to each other.
It was wrong when Megan did it to me.
It was wrong when you and Nicole
did it to her ex.
You don't think the fact that we got married
kind of justifies it?
No, I don't, not unless
you want to be married
to someone who doesn't mind cheating.
Hey, that's my wife, OK?
Nicole talks a good game
but she's been hurt like everybody else.
Her ex was a dick. He treated her real bad.
It's complicated.
All this love shit's complicated,
and that's good,
because if it's too simple
you've got no reason to try.
And if you got no reason to try, you don't.
Oh, oh... wait.
I just described you.
You know, maybe you're right.
But either way, you're an arsehole, Allan.
Hey.
He's just trying to get in your pants.
You know that, right? Wallace.
We're just friends.
(Sighs)
It isn't like that.
- He isn't like that.
- Oh, sorry.
Sorry, I didn't realise Wallace was
such a unique and magical creature,
because, er... to me he looks like a guy.
And I didn't realise
he was the only guy in the world
who doesn't wanna screw
every hot girl he knows.
- Like you with Julianne?
- What? No, we're just...
<i>F fiends'?</i>
(Sighs)
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Come in or whatever.
- Er...
I just jogged over here to feed the cat
but if I don't shower right away
my pores get all clogged
and I get this, like,
zit nest on my forehead.
- So, er... why are you feeding the cat?
- So it doesn't starve to death.
- Yeah, but why can't Chantry feed it?
- Because she flew to Dublin.
She flew to Dublin?
Yes... of course she did.
You like her.
You like Chantry.
Oh, God! Get in the shower.
I can see your blackheads from here.
No, don't get all snooty with me
just cos you're so busted.
Look, I'm not in love
with your sister, all right?
You are a nice-ish guy,
and you're amusing,
but Chantry loves Ben.
They're gonna get married
and they're gonna live happily ever after.
And you're just gonna be this guy that
she was friends with for a couple of months.
Like, what was his name?
Walter? I don't know.
So you just need to do
whatever you need to do to get over it, OK?
Cos it's never gonna happen.
Thank you.
So, er... I was reading this thing
about how when they were trying to come up
with the name for Cool Whip,
they brainstormed 10,000 ideas...
- Sorry, what is Cool Whip?
- (Ben) It's a kind of processed cream.
- It comes in a spray can.
- Or like in a tub.
Ja, I have had ze Cool Whip.
I prefer ze... ze fresh whipped cream.
But when they were trying to come up
with the name for that product,
er, they... they brainstormed 10,000 ideas.
And they said, like, try to come up
with just ten of your own
just to see how hard it is.
Like Puffy Whip, or... Wiffy Puff.
Puffy Air... Whippy Air...
Er... Cow Mixture?
- Sweet Dreams?
- Sweet Dreams.
- Cotton Vool Candy Cow?
- It could be one.
Milch. Milchi Médchen?
- So, you must be really proud of our Benji?
- Yeah.
He has the Brazilians on the run.
You know, he has
the whole negotiation in his hands?
We are so happy that he is able
to stay for another six months.
And his Portuguese is really coming on.
He's good.
His Spanish is better
but he's going to be so good
by the time we get to Rio de Janeiro.
(Ben) I haven't accepted the offer yet.
Obviously, I was planning to talk to you
about it first, but I mean...
I love it here, you know?
And it is not just the work. It's the people
and the culture and the music.
You never asked me
to move out here with you.
Yeah, well, I didn't wanna ask you
to quit a job you love.
- And, I mean, you never offered.
- You never asked.
Well, I'm asking you now.
I mean, there must be
animation companies here.
I couldn't do that to Holly.
She's generous enough
to give me this week off.
OK, so take the job.
It doesn't have to be a bad thing.
You'd be in Taipei, I'd be here.
We can meet in the middle.
- Like in Toronto?
- No, like Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Mumbai.
It'll be a story we can tell our kids.
It's romantic.
It sounds lonely.
Look, I'm just trying to make this work, OK?
Don't you wanna make this work?
(PA) 'Welcome to Dublin
and thank you for flying with us.'
She's gone.
Is she... coming back?
(Rumble of thunder)
(Wallace groans)
- (Distorted) Hi...
- Hi.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
(Mobile ringing)
- Are you sure?
- Yes, thank you.
- Your phone is ringing.
- Oh... thank you.
Oh, shit.
'Hey, Wallace, it's Chantry, er...
'OK, so I'm in Dublin
but I'm getting on a plane right now
'and I'm just wondering
if you're free for lunch tomorrow
'at, like, noon at the George Street Diner?
'Er... there's something
I wanna talk to you about.
'So, er... I hope to see you there.
OK, bye.'
Hey, Chantry.
Er... are you still in Dublin?
Lunch at the diner sounds great
but if you haven't left yet, er... call me.
OK, er... bye.
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Taxi!
Oh, come on!
(Aeroplane overhead)
George Street Diner.
Go, go, go!
Shit.
Excuse me.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Oh, my God!
What did you do to yourself?
Oh, er... ninja attack.
- Oh! The stupid ninjas.
- I know.
- I hate them.
- Me too. Very annoying.
Oh, thank you.
I'm good.
- How you doing?
- Hi...
- So I flew to Dublin, right?
- Right, yeah, you said.
OK, so...
There's, like, a bunch of stuff
that's going on with me
that I haven't told you about
because...
I haven't been sure
what the right thing to do is.
Wallace, your face just looks terrible.
Oh, no, don't worry about it, really.
Er... what were you gonna say?
OK, so... just that...
I've been having to do
a lot of big-picture thinking about...
Wallace, seriously, I cannot concentrate
because of your mangled head.
What did you do to yourself?
Did you... did you hit yourself
or something? Car accident?
Did you walk into a door?
Ben punched me.
I flew to Dublin.
- Why did you fly to Dublin?
- To... tell you how I feel about you.
- That's not why.
- Well, I wanted to be honest with you.
You could have been honest
with me any time.
You flew to Dublin
to break up me and Ben, right?
Er...
How long... have you felt this way?
Pretty much since the day we met.
So... when I said I have a boyfriend
and I just wanna be friends
and you said that's what you wanted too,
that was a lie?
No, I wanted that to be true.
But it wasn't.
You never wanted to be my friend.
We... we are friends.
I haven't just been trying to...
...put my junk inside your trunk.
I told Ben you weren't that kind of guy,
but you're totally that kind of guy.
God, he must think I'm such an idiot.
You must think I'm such an idiot.
- No, of course not, Chantry.
- I trusted you.
I trusted we were
what we said we were: friends.
But you can't be friends with someone
if you're just skulking around,
waiting for some opportunity
to screw them.
No! Look, what are you talking about?
I'm not...
It's not like you've caught me
bathing in orphan blood
or masturbating onto a kitten.
I just...
I like you a little bit more romantically
than I let on.
It's not a crime.
And... if it is,
you're not exactly innocent.
What's that supposed to mean?
You crossed all the same lines I did.
And I was single, you weren't.
I've never cheated on anybody.
And now you're making me feel
like I somehow cheated on Ben!
I'm making you feel like that?
What, and you did nothing
that I might possibly misconstrue?
That night on the beach?
<i>"I'll</i> look if you look"?
I mean... what, did you tell Ben about that?
That was a mistake.
This was a mistake.
- I'm leaving.
- Please. No, Chantry, please!
No, I'm leaving the country.
- What, you're moving to Dublin?
- No.
I've been offered a job in Taiwan.
I'm putting my career first.
So... I'll be gone soon, for a year.
Maybe more.
It's a really big promotion.
Congratulations.
See you around, Wallace.
- Uncle Wallace?
- Not right now, Felix.
- Can I talk to you?
- Felix, I said not right now!
I'm having a bad life.
What are you doing that's so important
that you don't have time for your nephew
when he needs you?
I'm not the kid's dad, all right?
He's your responsibility, not mine.
Fine, I'm a bad mum.
And when Felix grows up,
he can blame me for all his problems
and the circle of life can continue.
Until then, I'm doing the best I can.
Which is all any of us can do,
except you.
You are not doing the best you can do!
You...
- (Gulps)
- What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Are you choking?
- (Mumbles) Heimlich...
- OK, I'm gonna try and Heimlich you.
One.
- OK, again.
- (Gasps)
" Big one!
- Ah!
God!
And you know you're not a bad mum, right?
It wasn't exactly my plan that you should be
my son's primary male role model,
but you are.
Mmm... mine.
Gross.
This expired months ago.
Yeah, it's probably Ben's.
So that's it?
You're just gonna throw it away?
Let me guess.
We're not talking about salsa.
I just think you're making a huge mistake.
- Do you really think Taiwan is a mistake?
- Yes, I do.
I think you're totally screwing up
your life, actually.
Or not, maybe?
I just don't have any idea what I'm doing.
I'm gonna be all the way over there
and I'm not gonna have anybody with me.
I'm gonna be all alone and I'm gonna have
all these huge new responsibilities.
And then... you're gonna be so far away.
And Ben and...
And there's, you know...
Wallace.
Yeah.
Yeah, have you heard from him?
No, but I think I messed it up really bad.
I called him a liar
and I think that I might be the liar.
- No.
- Yes.
I mean, I think it might count as lying
if you lie to yourself.
No! Come here.
(Wallace) I think everything
might have turned out for the best.
I'm, er... I'm going back to med school.
I sent in my application today.
Oh, so you just gave up?
No. I'm... not giving up.
I'm getting back to the life
I was supposed to have by now.
When you're old and wrinkled
and your penis doesn't work anymore,
not that it's in great shape now,
but in that old, wrinkled, dickless future,
- will this seem like the right call?
- Yes.
I'll think dropping out of med school
because of a girl was stupid.
Not chasing after a girl who doesn't want me
was definitely smart
I'm a doctor now. I've saved probably
millions of lives cos I'm brilliant.
I cured the zombie epidemic.
You remember that?
I'm the one that found the cure
so you can just all be grateful.
Shut up and stop questioning my decisions.
(Allan) Hey, hey...
- What?
Well, it was supposed to be a secret
but... loose-lips over here knocked me up.
Oh, shit! You got a baby in you!
- Yeah, I know!
- Congratulations!
That means the apocalypse
has already started. That's great!
Yay!
And you're the first person we told
so you can't be mad at us anymore.
And you have to forgive pregnant people
for anything they've ever done to you.
- It's like a federal law.
- Deal.
Wow! I can't wait to meet this kid.
And... we're having a going-away party
for Chantry
and you should come to it to say goodbye.
No.
No, we already said our goodbyes.
(# RICHARD AUCOIN: "it")
(indistinct chatter)
- Wallace?
- No.
(indistinct)
Let me see your nails.
No, I think mine are normal
and yours are tiny.
- I don't want you to leave.
- No...
I'm sorry I'm late.
BYe- Skype me.
Be careful.
Take care of yourselves.
- I'm never gonna Skype.
- Call me tomorrow.
Bye .
. Hey-
. Hey-
(Wallace) How are you?
(Chantry) I'm great. How are you?
(Wallace) Good.
(Chantry) Good.
Er... so your new job
is going to be amazing.
- Er... and you get to live in Asia.
- Yeah.
I hear Taiwan is incredible.
Yeah, and you're gonna go back
to med school.
- Yeah, yes.
- That is so great.
You think so?
No, actually, I've always hated doctors
so I pretty much think
you've become the Antichrist.
Right, and Taiwan is shit.
Everything I said a second ago was a lie.
And you will have an awful time
cos, er... Chantry means "syphilitic woman".
- Well, at least it will be accurate.
- Yeah, right, exactly.
Yeah.
So, how long until you see people
as just slabs of meat
that you can cut up and sew back together
and not, like, actual people
with real feelings?
Oh, God, hopefully as soon as possible.
I mean, I have been practising at night
on tiny defenseless animals
and homeless people.
Oh, good. That's actually
what homeless people are there for.
Yes, I know.
They're all just bodies in waiting.
- Yeah, especially for a sociopath.
- Especially for... yeah!
That's been my goal for a long time,
as you know: just to feel nothing.
Yeah, it wouldn't be
such a bad idea sometimes.
- So Dublin...
- It's OK...
No, it's not. I'm really sorry.
It was stupid and I know Ben is a good guy
and he didn't deserve that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So, are you two OK?
I'm not sure.
About anything.
So, I got really creative
when I was cleaning out my fridge.
- Did you?
- And, er... I, er...
I made you that.
It's, er... it's Fool's Gold.
I even coated the loaf in butter
as you are supposed to.
That's the real thing.
I can't believe you did this.
This is your going-away present.
I don't know what to say.
So, I thought a lot
about something you said,
about how when you realise
how quickly everything can fall apart
it makes you never wanna give up
anything good ever again.
Whatever this is between us...
it is good.
It is so good, it is actually the best thing
that has ever happened to me
and I don't want it to be over.
I don't want it to be over either.
I kinda wish, you know, like...
we could invent a time machine or something.
- If we ever invent time travel...
- Yeah?
...I would go back to the night we met.
- You would?
- Yes.
What will you do differently?
Nothing.
Me too.
