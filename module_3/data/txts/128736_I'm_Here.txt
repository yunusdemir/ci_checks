What are you guys
doing after the show?
Modeling for
a fucking art class?
Previously on I'm Dying Up Here...
What do you say you fill in
for me a couple days?
-Eh...
-My old lady's gonna
fucking kill me if I don't
take a couple days off.
Nick, you're gonna
love doing this.
So basically,
it's a game show sketch
where white people
try to convince us
they've suffered
just as much as black folk.
What the fuck?
It's just one day.
We've been going non-stop ever
since this shit got picked up.
-We shooting in four weeks!
-Four weeks, man.
Come on, half of the sketches
are already written up.
Really?
You're telling me
I can't dig up enough money
for my daughter's
fucking tuition?
You think you're
going to find happiness
in this fucking business?
Want to do some blow
before the wedding?
Roy!
I got you.
She took
a pile of shit tonight,
and spun it into gold.
All so she could
plug her new club
under the guise
of this fucking fiasco.
-Another place to perform.
-Yeah, for fucking free.
It's a school, remember?
It's a school that no one's
ever graduated from.
39 in the morning.
In here with
"Kenny in the Early AM."
And this one goes out
to all our
early risers or late owls.
-You're in early.
-Yeah.
Well, the chick I'm crashing
with ran out of coffee.
You know this is
just temporary, right?
Until they find a place
they can slot you permanently.
Are you fucking comforting me?
Listen, bucko, you're just
a morning aberration
like me getting 6 a.m. wood
after dropping Quaaludes
the night before, okay?
People are going to get tired
of your little
Sylvia Plath bullshit,
and they are gonna want
"Kenny in the AM"
back in morning drive time,
and you can
fucking count on it.
You know, Kenny,
KROQ's ad time has doubled
in the last month
that I've been doing
this sad bastard shit.
So every week,
I'm this much closer
to being the number one
morning drive time show in LA.
Shim sham!
-That's trademarked, asshole!
-Fuck off.
Hello, and welcome to
"You Think You Got It Bad."
America's game show
where white people compete
to prove that they've suffered
just as much as black folk.
I'm your host,
Jimmy Jam Johnson.
Now our first contestant
is a second generation
Irish American by the name
of Colleen O'Hannahan.
Now, Colleen, it says here
that you're celebrating
three years of marriage, and
that you're a mother of four.
We're good Catholics, Jimmy,
and you can never have enough
hungry mouths to feed,
I always say.
Nice, is your
husband here too?
No. He went to the pub
with the kids.
He'll pick me up after,
God willing.
Okay. Now, let's meet
our defending champ.
She's a single mother of five.
She works 50 hours a week
-as a cashier at Sears...
...For minimum wage.
She calls Watts Towers
her home.
Make some noise
for Shaquilla Jackson.
Now, Shaquilla, are you ready
to defend your title
of "You Think You Got It Bad"?
Sure am, Jimmy.
-Oof.
-Whoa, whoa, hey.
-Whew.
-You all right?
I'm fine, I just got shot on
the way to my car this morning.
Shot, well, don't you think you
need some medical attention?
Nah, the bullet
went straight through.
It didn't hit no major organs,
so let's play.
That's the spirit!
Let's get this thing started.
Now, Colleen, why do you think
you've got it bad?
My grandfather
came to this country
and faced
terrible discrimination.
There were signs
posted everywhere
that read
"No Irish need apply".
Many was the night
when he went without eating.
Nice, nice.
Shaquilla?
My grandfather was lynched.
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to
give that one to Shaquilla.
Ten points!
My grandmother had ten
hungry mouths to feed,
and she had to take in
sewing and mending
other people's garments
in order to make ends meet.
My grandmother was lynched.
-Oh.
-The potato famine.
Cousin lynched.
Plague, and she can't just
keep saying "lynched."
-Slavery.
-Damn it!
And lynching,
a whole lot of lynchin'.
Colleen?
-We sunburn easily.
-Ah.
I'm sorry, Colleen,
but you lose.
But you still win,
because you're walking
out of here a white person.
Tune in next week, as
Shaquilla defends her title
against Schlomo Weinbach
from Queens.
Bring on the Holocaust.
I'm your host,
Jimmy Jam Johnson.
Join me next week.
I'll be right here.
Unless I get pulled over,
in which case,
there will just be
another black dude here
that you'll probably
still think is me.
So good night, everybody!
All right.
That's money, baby!
-That's some funny shit!
-That's really funny,
and some groundbreaking stuff.
Hey, Ralph, you got a minute?
Whoo!
What's up, man?
Oh, lynching,
are you fuckin' crazy?
Hey, we didn't
come here to tiptoe.
The network
approve this sketch?
Well, the network
hasn't not approved it.
They pretty much left us alone.
Hey, the Redd Foxx negotiations
are taking all their focus,
but eventually, they'll turn
their attention to this,
and there's no way
they're airing a sketch
about fucking lynching.
It's satire.
They told us they wanted
outside the box.
Trust me.
A niche audience
of Black Panthers
is not the demo
advertisers are clamoring for.
We need some crossover appeal.
So, put it back in the box?
Either the box, or a coffin.
Look, until the network
says otherwise,
we're gonna stick
to our vision,
and make the best pilot we can.
Every failure
that's never seen
the light of day
was somebody's vision.
This might be
your vision, Ralph.
It is still their network.
Really great, guys.
Goldie.
Was anyone with him?
-A comic, huh?
That's what the nurse said.
-Hey.
What are the three parts
of a wood burning stove?
-I don't know.
-Lift, the legs, and poker.
Come on, man.
They got lasagna
in the commissary today.
-Edgar.
-Yeah?
-Fitzy passed.
-Ah, shit.
-I loved Fitz.
-Man was a legend.
I mean, it seemed like
just yesterday,
he was lying there,
lifeless on the ground.
Yeah.
Anyway,
I got to bow out
of the Bakersfield show.
You can't bow out
of Bakersfield.
We're supposed to leave
in three hours.
Goldie promised Fitzy
an Irish wake.
So it's tomorrow.
What the hell is an Irish wake?
You lie Fitzy on a table,
and everyone drinks and parties
all around him.
Haven't we already thrown him
a hundred of those?
Anyway, I got to
set it all up,
so you're gonna
have to find someone else.
Sorry, pal.
Well, you're not gonna
be hard to replace.
Hey, do you know a chimp
who rides a tricycle?
-Okay.
-Maybe he smokes cigars
out of his asshole--
Yeah, I could go
to Bakersfield.
Great, you'll be opening
for Edgar Martinez.
Edgar Martinez.
Yep, the show starts at 9 p.m.
There's something you
should know about me, Mort.
Buddy, it's okay, Edgar already
told me, you're an asshole.
I'm a kidder.
What's on your mind?
Me opening for Edgar Martinez
is like Pink Floyd
opening for
Karen Carpenter, okay?
I got the couch on Carson.
Edgar couldn't get the couch
from a place
that sells couches.
-I headline.
-Edgar Martinez is a gold mine.
Edgar Martinez
is a national treasure.
Don't get me wrong,
Mort, he's fine,
but Edgar's like
eating soup out of a can.
I'm the full meal, okay?
I headline,
or find someone else.
And he
gets the line in there.
Hey, you bringing
the kids tomorrow?
Oh, they're still talking
about last year's
make your own sundae bar.
We'll be there.
Hey, and don't start the ping
pong tournament without me.
Oh, wouldn't think of it.
You're still
going down, though.
Oh, we'll see about that.
So you're having a party, huh?
Oh, daughter's birthday.
She's turning 12.
You know, just having a few
people over, nothing fancy.
-Aw, so who's not going?
-You, of course.
-Mm-hmm.
-And the new guy
from hair and makeup.
He was invited.
His kid has
the chicken pox, so.
You are really enjoying this,
aren't you?
Oh, come on, man, I can't say
that not inviting you
isn't a perk
of working with you, Ron.
Well, enjoy your weekend,
and fuck you and yours.
Mm.
Eat shit and die, you too.
I always come on
Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.
It was Friday today.
Yeah.
How you doing
It's not my favorite hotel.
We had some sad news.
Good old Fitzy passed.
-I work with him?
-Yeah, yeah, you know him.
Fitzy.
When's he go up?
-Um...
-Hey, Goldie.
Didn't realize this was
a dinner reservation for two.
-Oh, hey, Dana.
-Who is that, who is that?
It's Dana, she's got your food.
It's Dana, with your food.
-Huh?
-Take it away, please.
Take it away.
-I'm gonna close my eyes.
-Yeah, you do that.
I'll just leave it here
just in case
you get hungry later, okay?.
Dana, could I
have a word with you?
What are you doing here
It's like Cuckoo's Nest.
Well, Roy's a little
sluggish after his therapy.
Sluggish?
Something is turning
that man's brain
into mashed potatoes.
-He's not himself.
-Roy is himself.
He's relaxed, he's calm,
he's taking his meds.
This is Roy getting healthy.
My brain may be fried,
but I can still
fucking hear you.
I worry, is all.
-Well, don't.
-Oh.
-I can worry, can't I?
-No, don't...
Look at me like that.
Look at you like what?
I'm gonna make it
to the opening next month.
We open in two weeks.
Sweetheart, you've been in here
a month and a half.
Edgar, why do you need
an apron to vacuum?
Yeah, fuck off.
What do you know about this
gig we're performing at?
It's in Bakersfield.
What else is there to know?
I don't know,
I guess I'm just excited
to perform somewhere
that isn't Goldie's.
"Effective, not winning."
Fuck her.
It's hard to argue
with the truth.
Fuck you.
You really don't think
you're a dick, right?
You have a whole bit
about dogs, and you hate dogs.
You pissed on your own dad's
dog's grave, for fuck's sake.
-You pissed on it, too.
-Yeah, but I had to go.
There was no malice in my piss.
Yours was a revenge piss.
And fucking, if that
ain't being a dick,
I don't know what a dick is.
-Eh, it could be worse.
-How so?
I could be the guy
opening up for a dick.
Come on.
Fuck.
-Registration in the car?
-Yeah.
All right,
when you come down--
Hello?
What are you
trying to do, Cass?
Sarah, what--
What's wrong?
Your letter to Jesse.
You promised to take him
to Disneyland next summer?
Yeah, well, I would love to.
I think it would be really nice
to have some one-on-one time
and go on some rides
and have some fun.
Funny how you never
promised to take the girls
to Disneyland,
which Jesse pointed out,
as he shot them at dinner
with the gun you got him.
-That was my night.
-Sorry.
It isn't funny, Cass.
Not everything is a joke.
What were you thinking?
I--that it would be
nice for him
to spend time with me,
and for us to have some fun.
As what?
Let me answer that for you,
as an aunt.
Like Winnie and Paula
know you, as an aunt.
We both know
I'm more than that.
No, we don't.
Ever since the wedding,
soon as things don't go well
for you in LA,
you start looking to Jesse
to give some meaning
to your life.
-That's not what I'm doing.
-What do you want?
You can't have him back.
You can't tell him who you are.
So what's
your game plan here, Cass?
-I wouldn't tell him.
-I'm not buying that.
I just--I think it's best
that you leave us alone.
Wait, so you don't even
want me to call you?
Look, your choices are
turning my home upside down,
and I won't have it,
so either you stop being
so damn selfish,
or leave us the hell alone.
All right, all right, let's
get this show started, huh?
Bakersfield,
how you doing tonight?
Okay, keep it going
for your, uh, bartender,
because that's who I know
you really came to see, huh?
Who here likes tequila?
I love tequila.
But guess what?
Tequila does not love me.
I drank so much tequila
the other night,
that I blacked out, right?
And then I woke up, and I was
so scared about the blackout,
that I ran
and grabbed my friends,
and I told them
how scary the blackout was,
and then I realized I was
already in another blackout.
-That's funny because--
-Get off the stage, beaner!
You know what?
I might. I think I actually
will get off the stage.
Ha ha, because that's my time!
Thank you very much.
All right, you guys ready
for your headliner?
Uh, this next guy,
you may have seen on Carson,
if you were taking time out
from your busy schedules
of burying people in the desert
and punching old ladies
in the vagina.
Whatever you guys do for fun.
Big round of applause
for Bill Hobbs!
Let him hear it!
All right, got them warmed up
for you, headliner, enjoy it.
You had 20 more
fucking minutes, asshole.
Hey, uh, one more time
for, uh, Edgar Martinez.
Edgar Martinez, huh?
So I'm, uh, not married,
I don't have any kids, uh...
Maybe one day, you know?
Come on, guys,
it's a good one.
Uh, dogs have it right,
don't you guys think
they've got the right idea?
-All right.
-Not all right.
Uh, they'll sniff--uh,
sniff at each other's asses--
Cheers, yeah!
The mouth on this motherfucker.
Hey, mister, uh, 187.
Yeah, you.
Is that what it says
on your little badge?
Why don't you serve me one of
those fucking beers, huh?
What do you say
I'm talking to you,
looking right at you,
and your motley crew of
out-of-work mall Santas there.
I'm thirsty,
I'm quite parched from
making my way
all across California
to get up here
to Shitsville, USA.
This your, uh,
your gang of buddies
-that you're with, there, huh?
It's a cute little gang.
I like your vests.
I like those a lot, you know?
Got little merit badges,
like Girl Scouts.
You know, what is that,
you got one stab, one rape,
and then one sewing,
that's good.
Like, somebody had to
make those, I guess, right?
Good for you guys, man.
Hey, nothing says
straight male other than
riding around on a bicycle with
other men in matching outfits.
That's not a gay thing
to do, whatsoever.
You guys are guys, huh?
You put your penises
in women, don't you?
Beautiful women, women that
look like catcher's mitt's.
What's the name of your
little, uh, your gang?
-Satan's Hounds, asshole.
-Mm-hmm.
Satan's Hound's Asshole.
Okay, wow.
The asshole of a hound.
Satan's Hound's Asshole.
So you guys are inside
Satan's dog's butthole.
Wow, that's hotter than hot,
I would imagine, right?
I'm sure you guys
came in on a bus, too,
except yours was short,
wasn't it?
Especially you,
with that wonky eye.
-Sir, it's just a comedy show.
-Excuse me, can we get paid?
Bunch of fucking mall Santas
sitting around.
What do you guys
do in the off-season?
You fuck the elves?
If I could just get the money
now, that'd be great.
You know who I am, Mr. 187?
Papa 187, I'm your fucking dad.
That's right.
Because I threw my hog,
right here, inside your mom.
I just went out
and stuck it inside of her.
I slid it in,
and I let it soak, baby.
It glowed
when it was inside of her.
It was unbelievable.
It's orange, and see-through.
But inside of your mom?
Could see it for miles,
like a lighthouse.
I swam inside,
and you came out.
We're not happy, but I got to
tell you, I'll take it.
Son, why don't you
give Daddy a beer?
Holy shit, holy shit.
Yeah, right on.
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah.
Hey, to
Satan's Hound's Assholes!
Yeah!
Fuckin' A, Bakersfield!
Yes!
Why would you
want to cut the sketch?
I didn't say cut all of it.
Just trim it a little.
-Like what?
-The lynching references.
Oh, come on, man,
you ain't just trying to trim.
You pulling fucking teeth.
Do you want
this show on the air?
-You know I do.
-Then listen to me.
Sponsors ain't
gonna spend dime one
on a show making reference
to lynching.
White people
find lynching offensive?
Basically.
Wasn't the time for them
to find it offensive
when they was doing the shit?
Adam, I don't
disagree with you.
But look, let's get
the show on the air.
Then we'll make our stand.
We got to be smart right now.
Pick our fights.
Hey, you trust me, right?
You know I trust you.
All right.
So what's as equally
as fucked up,
but not offensive to whitey?
That's the challenge, Adam.
That is the challenge.
You know 187 is the California
penal code for murder, right?
Yeah, well,
that's pretty appropriate,
because that's exactly what
I did inside of there, Edgar.
I fucking murdered.
-Yeah.
-Hey, Daddy 187.
Hey.
Be cool, Edgar.
What's with him?
Nothing, that's just, uh,
where he keeps his spine.
-You a funny motherfucker.
-Thanks, man.
Hey, if you guys
are ever in LA,
I'm always at Goldie's
on the Sunset Strip,
so call the club,
I'll get you comped.
Fuck yeah, we're always in LA.
Definitely take you up on that.
Right on,
thanks for being so cool.
About that being so cool part.
You got me
pretty good in there,
and I got a reputation
to uphold.
So I'm gonna
kind of have to hurt you.
-Kinda hurt me?
-Yeah.
Like on a scale of one to ten?
Probably a nine, or death.
But I like you, so I think
a seven should cover it.
Any chance of getting that
reduced to like, a five?
Wait, wait, wait--
Come on, man, okay--
Somebody help him!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, mall Santas!
Mall Santas! I love that.
That kills me every time.
We'll see you in LA.
So now you help, huh?
Right, because I'm gonna
be a human piñata
'cause you can't read
an audience that can't read?
And besides,
why should I help somebody
who thinks I'm
Karen Carpenter, right?
Who has a beautiful voice,
by the way.
Yeah, what, to your Pink Floyd
Mort told you that?
-It might have come up.
-Motherfucker.
What kind of booker--
I'm gonna kick
that guys' ass.
Yeah, no, you can't,
'cause he's old.
Do you know
where his office is?
You have bruised ribs.
You're not going anywhere.
You practically cried
when you farted in the car.
-For him to tell you that--
-I'm Mort.
-What?
-I'm Mort.
It's me.
I've been doing the voice.
Well, it's me and Arnie.
He shares it with me.
Because we started getting
calls from club owners,
and we knew Goldie
wouldn't let us book ourselves,
so I became Mort.
And we got a lot of gigs,
and had to expand our stable.
So Mort's ten percent?
Which, you can keep Mort's
ten percent, that's yours.
No, fuck it, you deserve it.
You got me work, Edgar.
That's what a booker does.
So you're not
gonna tell Goldie?
Fucking Goldie?
Why the fuck
would I tell Goldie?
It's--some shit gig
in Bakersfield
has the money to pay us,
but she doesn't?
And then she thinks
she can tell us
what we can and can't do?
Yeah.
Fuck Goldie, Edgar.
So you--
You didn't mean what you said?
The Karen Carpenter thing?
I'm sorry.
You know I didn't mean it, I--
I just wanted to headline, man.
It's been such a shit year.
Maybe I am just a dick.
I wouldn't call you that.
You call me a dick
all the time.
-I do?
-Yeah, a lot.
I just--
I just think, onstage, that
you're trying to be the hero,
but maybe you're the villain.
Because the villain
murdered last night.
I'm gonna get some ice.
You here to tell me
about a home loan?
Ah, Fitzy's wake in an hour.
Get dressed.
You know,
my ex-wife gave me this--
Can we call her Trudy, please?
Because she said
that I reminded her
of
Jonathan Livingston Seagull?
A bird who flew higher
than all the other birds.
I'm hooked.
Why don't you tell me more
on the car ride over?
Man, I--
I don't think I'm up
for a wake right now.
Ah, come on.
We'll get hammered
and pay our respects.
-I guess.
-Great.
So why doesn't
Jonathan Livingston Seagull
take a little shower,
and I'll meet you upstairs.
Eddie, what do you think of me?
What do you mean,
what do I think of you?
I mean, like, you know,
I know--I know that you're
my best friend, and that, um...
What do you--what do you
really think of me?
Hm.
Well, I think
you're a great guy...
Who could use a shower.
It smells like
a cholera outbreak down here.
Yeah.
All right, I'll see you
in a minute.
Seriously, Ron.
You're a great guy.
-Look what I found!
-Oh, shit!
What the fuck
are you doing here?
-We already had your wake.
-It's so weird to be back.
It's like I'm visiting
junior high school.
Everything is smaller,
except Ralph.
-Fuck you.
-Ah, Sull!
It's good to see you
almost still have it, bud.
Why does Fitzy
look better than Bill?
Road gig, Bakersfield.
Not the sleepy town you think.
Oh, I'm sorry I missed
your comedy special,
but I had to blink.
I am so sick of that excuse.
-Hi.
-Sully!
I would have come sooner.
Who knew Fitzy
would hang on so long?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
Open bar in honor of Fitz.
Let's get this wake started.
Who wants to
make a toast, anyone?
Oh, me.
Uh...
To Fitzy, Goldie's
would never be the same
without an alcoholic hack
that never wrote any jokes,
you know?
Oh, Ron, hey!
booze.
The coroner report
said his liver
was so black and damaged,
Nick fucked it in my bed.
Wow, you still ain't over that?
No, and I never will be.
On the one side,
you got to see my balls
without having
to lift up the sheet
while I was asleep, so.
I did like that.
That I liked, really.
All right, if all the comedians
could raise their glass,
and just remember
that it doesn't
end well for a lot of us.
I mean, there's suicide,
there's alcoholism,
there's the drugs.
All right, and there's even
the more grisly deaths
-that we rarely talk about.
-Yeah.
Like the ones
that Nick suffers onstage
every time he walks up there.
Yeah, fuck you.
Let's stop focusing
on Fitzy's drinking,
and his passing out
and wetting himself.
That would be unfair.
It would be like focusing
on Ron's acting.
Or, wait,
Cassie's choice in men.
Hey, Fitzy really was
the best lay.
Or Goldie's payroll!
To Fitzy, he died without
money, fame, dignity,
but he paved the way
for many countless comics,
and by countless,
I mean Arnie and Edgar.
Hold on, hold on,
my turn, my turn, all right?
You know, we give Fitzy shit,
but he was a great comic.
In fact, the only job he
didn't excel at was pool boy.
Well, Ron's party
killed him, right?
Fuck you, okay?
I didn't kill him.
I was trying to save his life.
Hey, Ron, you know, drinking
whiskey out of a coconut,
that's not a cure
for alcoholism, right?
You know about that?
It's not gonna work, yeah.
All right, all right, okay,
okay, everybody, settle down.
Four years ago, when Fitzy
had his first heart attack,
he wrote this will,
and I have had it
in my office ever since.
I, James Seamus Fitzpatrick...
Being of sound
mind and body--
Actually, I'm drunk, and fat,
but nevertheless,
hereby bequeath to Edgar
all of my Mexican jokes,
including
"Where do Mexican girls go
to pray during the week?"
Planned Parenthood.
That's right,
you got it, finally.
And what do you call
a Mexican hitchhiker?
Stranded. And now,
my Dictaphone joke,
I'm taking to the grave.
Sorry, assholes, write your
own surefire punchlines.
And to Goldie,
thanks for giving me a home.
Yours would have been nicer.
Eh, could have used
a working shower.
But I had a home onstage,
and for that,
I will be forever grateful.
I also have a confession.
I've been in love with Gina,
the waitress from Canter's
but never had the nerve
to ask her out.
I never had one
to ask her in, either.
So unless she's, uh, the one
reading this, I never did.
Maybe I'll ask her out in
heaven, I'll play it by ear.
A man comes into
my office, he says,
can I use your Dictaphone?
I say no, you use your finger
like everybody else.
I know you don't
want to hear it--
Then don't say it.
But I want to tell you
that I am sorry.
And I know it doesn't
fix anything,
and it doesn't
make anything better,
but I really am truly sorry.
Thanks, but I'm already
attending a wake, you know?
We got to talk about this.
I mean, are we ever
gonna talk about this?
Me, no.
You, apparently, yes.
Eddie, I love you, and I know--
can you just--can you stop with
the free food for one second?
I love you, and I know
that I hurt you.
And I just want us
to talk about it--
Stop, Cass.
This is not
a bump in the road, okay?
You fucked Nick, a friend.
There is no getting past that.
-Hey!
-Hey!
-Hello.
-Welcome.
-Hi.
-You all right?
-You all right?
-Yeah, man, I'm fine.
I didn't like
that motherfucker anyway.
Married?
Well, that's kind of
a strong word for what it was.
It was more of
a catered fire drill.
I can't tell you
how good it is to see you.
Me too.
Though I do watch you
all the time on Watts Local.
Ugh, my catchphrase.
You could describe
my whole character on a mug.
I hate it.
Ronnie.
I've been reading this book,
um, it's about...a bird.
I mean, the book is about
wanting to do more,
like, be more,
and how that can make
other people
around you hate you.
Jonathan Livingston Seagull.
-Yeah, that's the book.
-"The speed was power.
The speed was joy.
The speed was pure beauty."
Well, I haven't
read the whole thing yet,
but I think
I'm coming up on that part.
Um, right now,
it's a lot of soaring.
It's my favorite book
in the whole, wide world.
Jonathan Livingston Seagull is
why I'm in acupuncture school.
Oh, you're learning
acupuncture, that's cool.
I wanted more, too, like JLS.
I mean, the old me
wanted to be Carol Merrill,
and then, I realized
just how limiting
pointing at appliances
was for a living.
And then, that was just
the other seagulls
trying to keep me down.
So now, I'm doing something
more fulfilling.
And helping people.
It's funny,
you know, 'cause...
Like, I'm successful,
and I got money, and cars,
and the big house, and like,
more shit than I ever
dreamed of having,
but I'm not happy.
Maybe you have the wrong dream.
Are dreams returnable?
Close your eyes.
Imagine the place
where you felt the most
like
Jonathan Livingston Seagull.
The most creative and free.
Soaring.
What?
-It's way too stupid.
-Nothing is stupid.
-I bought something.
-What?
Something totally impractical
that I haven't told anybody
about, not even Eddie.
Then tell me.
No.
I'll show you.
-Okay.
-Come on.
Hey, uh, not to talk business,
but what's up with the rewrite
of the game show sketch?
Sounds like business.
Feels a little more Sonny
and Cher than Ralph and Adam.
All right, now,
you can't go shit talking
Sonny and Cher now, all right?
Ralph's connection with Ed
is the only reason
why we are what we are.
Well, I can't
piss off my daddy with this.
Pissing off your daddy
will just come later.
This a long con.
Get yourself on the air first,
and then cut loose.
Can't piss Daddy off
if we ain't on TV, yeah?
Ain't that right, Ralph?
Man speaks the truth.
All right, no disrespect.
Y'all's vision.
-Damn straight.
-Right.
Thank you.
What do you think the point is
of a deathbed confession?
Uh, I don't know.
Save all your secrets,
blurt them out, disappear.
You don't have to deal with
anyone's judgment after?
Yeah, I guess.
I don't know, not every truth
needs to see the light of day.
No, by all means, let them eat
away at your stomach lining.
-Okay, good talk.
-Sorry.
I'm the last guy
you owe an apology to.
Sadly, you're not.
What's your
deathbed confession?
No.
No, you don't get to just
flip ahead to the last page.
Oh, come on,
you puked on my neck.
Don't I deserve a little,
itty-bitty deathbed confession?
I guess I'll wish
I enjoyed shit more.
Meaning?
I just take all this shit
too serious, you know?
Want to get out of here?
Yeah, I'll get out of here.
-You want to get out of here?
-No.
I feel like that's how
we got in trouble
in the first place, but...
-Let's go.
-Go where?
Someplace fun that
doesn't end in us staring
at the ceiling
sharing a cigarette.
Come on.
A framed photo with Jack Paar
from 20 years ago.
That's the thing
that meant the most to him?
Yeah, it's not exactly
Tut's tomb up here.
We've all been to his place,
so it's either that,
or a dirty glass with whiskey
crud at the bottom of it.
He spent
the majority of his life
in a one-bedroom apartment,
drunk, penniless, and unknown.
Hey, you know
Edgar can hear you, right?
Oh, shut the fuck up, Sully.
It feels like forever since
I've been able to say that.
This is why
I quit the business.
I want more
at the end of the day
than just a picture
with Jack Paar.
Oh, please, there's no way
you don't miss it.
I know you
don't believe it, Bill,
but you know,
outside of this club,
there's an
entire world going on.
It's this wonderful thing
called life.
I'm married with a kid,
another one on the way.
A steady job, and when I crash
on a couch, it's my own.
Well, good for you, Sull.
But this is our life.
It was Fitzy's,
he deserved better.
Just like we do.
You know,
Goldie paying for his wake
and a few remaining bills
is nice,
but the time for her
to pay for things
was when he was still alive.
You know, I actually thought
you quit the business
because you were
a horrible comedian.
But it's nice to know
that life thing.
To Fitzy.
Or we could just drink.
Oh, my God.
Are you having a good time?
Uh, actually, yeah, yes.
Thanks for winning me my bear.
Sure, best $22.50 I ever spent.
Hopefully that makes up
for the audition--
Oh, no history today.
Only rides, sugar, and horses!
Here we go, here we go,
here we go!
Come on, you little leprechaun.
Should I try to prevent those?
Where was the last place
you saw your daddy?
There.
Well, how about
we go over there together
and try to find him?
I can't.
I can't go with strangers.
He's gonna be mad.
No, no, no, he might
be upset, but--
What if he hates me now
for not listening?
No, he's not gonna hate you.
I promise.
Hey, hey.
What if we walk behind you?
You know, to make sure
that you're all right,
while you find him.
Okay, because then, you're not
really walking with us, right?
Would that be okay?
Yeah?
Okay.
Lead the way.
Look at you,
springing into action.
Uh, it's a good rule, you know,
just needs a little bending.
It's funny the way
kids make sense of things.
What do you mean?
Him thinking that his father
would hate him
for getting lost,
I mean, who could hate
a seven-year-old boy?
Daddy!
We've been looking
all over for you.
Hi.
Good, huh?
Oh, thank you, darling.
I ever tell you about
the time I saw Pryor?
Psh. Do you even
know another story?
Don't be a asshole.
I'm--I'm not talking about
when I was drunk with him.
I'm talking about the
first time I saw his act.
Mm, no.
Finally, I don't have to
move my lips along
while you tell a story.
I had only been
in LA, uh, a week.
You know, and
I came here to see him.
And uh, he was all fucked up.
And it just got bad, you know?
And he got quiet.
"Richard, we love you!"
And...
And he just stood there,
and it was silent.
And real quiet-like,
he said, "I love you, too."
It was almost like
his mask had fell off
in the middle of his act.
And they were
handing it back to him.
Then the rest of his act
just became about
him being drunk and bombing.
But they dug it.
That's how powerful
his shit is.
The man
even fails like a genius.
I want that.
I want to be a man
who can fail like a genius.
I still can't believe
you bought this.
Well, it was kind of
an impulse buy.
The impulse being
cocaine and whiskey.
I think it's fucking awesome.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I mean, they were just
gonna close it down.
It barely cost anything.
Well, does it make you happy?
Yeah, it really does.
I mean, when we were kids,
me and my friends,
we lived at our
roller rink, you know?
It had everything, cute girls,
me and my buddies
goofing around.
I was pretty good too.
I could do all those
fancy tricks and stuff.
I mean, I'd fall on my ass
half the time,
but it didn't matter, you know?
You just got up, kept going.
Jonathan Livingston Shack.
You were just living
your true self, Ronnie.
-You really think so?
-I know it.
-Yeah, hello?
-Hi.
I'm looking for Eddie Zeidel.
Uh, this is Eddie.
Who's this?
It's Sarah, Cassie's sister.
Sister/cousin.
How are you?
Good.
I know we've never met,
but she gave me
your number once,
and I really
need to ask a favor.
Okay, um, Sarah,
is everything okay?
We had a fight about Jesse.
I know she means well,
but she really needs
to learn some boundaries.
Boundaries with--with Jesse?
I said some
harsh things to her.
I was just upset, and Jesse
can't have two mothers.
I know she gave birth
to him and all,
but it's not fair to any of us,
especially Jesse.
Sure, yeah, that...makes sense.
I'm kind of
desperate here.
I thought you being
her boyfriend and all,
maybe you could help?
Has she said anything
about the fight, or...
No.
Do you think
you could talk to her?
Explain things, 'cause...
I think she'll listen to you,
and I'm blue
in the face over here.
Why are you forgiving me?
Why not?
My eyes were open.
I met this priest
at a coffee shop.
His bicycle with a confessional
strapped to the back.
He was giving out penance
to these hookers.
Where the hell
are you having coffee?
He said we have to
forgive our monsters.
Or our transgressors.
You ever think maybe we're the
monsters we have to forgive?
You said, who could hate
a seven-year-old boy?
And I have.
-What's this?
-A rewrite.
This is the same shit
that we started with.
-What's going on?
-I fucked it up.
Now I'm un-fucking it up.
But why
change your mind now, man?
-We about to shoot this shit.
-I know, I know.
I don't got an explanation.
I just--I lost my way.
Come on, Ralph, man,
you scaring me now.
Hey, Adam, I'm scared shitless.
I cost you a bundle on this.
You put your faith in me,
and not to mention,
I got all my eggs
in this basket too.
Yeah, but you told me,
back in 'Nam,
scared is when you did
your best thinking.
It is, and that's why
we going back
to what we
originally wrote together.
That, and it's
fucking hilarious.
-Well, let's do this thing.
-Let's do it, come on.
Can we talk a sec?
It's 11 o'clock in the morning.
Aren't "The Three Stooges"
on somewhere?
That should prove
how important this is.
I need you
to hear me out, Gold.
-I-I have a proposal for you.
-Goodie.
I know you don't
want to pay the comics.
-Oh, for--
-Just listen, please.
I know it's a school.
I respect that.
But most of the comics
that perform here for free
are either broke
or barely hanging on.
I was with a comic
who killed the other night,
and couldn't afford
a hamburger after.
I think I have a compromise
you'll agree with.
Who said I wanted a compromise?
What if we raised the price
at the door one buck?
And the comics
who don't headline,
they get to split
that extra buck.
-It won't cost you anything--
-I am not paying
these young comics a red cent.
The guy can go get a job.
That's what everybody's
always done.
There are other clubs opening,
you know.
I know, I'm opening them.
So that's it?
It will cost you zero, and
you still won't consider it?
You know, Billy,
you're like a cat
bringing its master
a dead mouse.
Thinking it's a gift.
I think we're done here.
That's one opinion.
So in the scene
where you come to the door
wrapped in toilet paper,
you know,
after the
neighborhood kids TP you,
it would be great if you said
"It's Benny time!"
You know, like the toilet
paper's covering your mouth?
And you--
why am I even asking you?
You'll probably
be eating a bagel
when you read it anyway.
Ernie...
Thank you.
Well, don't thank me,
it's my job.
No, I mean, uh, for everything.
Oh, well...you're welcome, Ron.
Everybody, could I
have your attention?
This will just take a second.
I quit.
Ron, knock it off.
We got a table read here.
Hey, Ron,
you've had your laugh.
Ron?
Okay, someone get me
that fucking asshole's
fucking asshole
agent on the phone.
It's about control.
You go in thinking Goldie's
only for the money,
that's just like bringing
a knife to a gun fight.
Thanks.
I think I'm still buzzed
from the wake.
Yeah, I got to say, man,
the Irish know
how to do it right.
A black funeral,
there's always somebody grandma
pulling the grandpa
out the coffin and wailing.
Five minutes later, she's on
her second glass of wine
and fifth finger sandwich.
I wonder what happened to Roy,
you know?
He and Fitzy were tight.
You'd think he would have
shown up for that
out of the woodwork,
and send him off.
He's just busy.
He's in the loony bin.
My mom says
he's really out of it.
Roy
Thanks for the hit.
That changes everything.
No Roy, and her club opening
in two weeks?
-How so?
-Leverage.
Without Roy,
Goldie's gonna need
her best comics to perform.
Yeah, but she's still got
100 comics
that will do whatever she wants
for even stage time.
That's right,
that's right, Edgar.
That's why this is
a bigger conversation.
We need to get
all the comics together.
-To do what?
-Take action.
What, are we going to
show up at her house
with torches and pitchforks
and demand that she pay us?
That's very Cinco de Mayo
of you, Edgar,
but I'm thinking more along
the lines of organization.
You mean like a strike?
That's exactly what I mean.
A strike.
Because if it's about control,
let us be the one
that has it for once.
No comedians, no comedy club.
I like the way you think
with that weed.
You know, I do feel sharp.
You're still gonna
drive drunk, though.
Hey, it's just
a bunch of beers.
Hey.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
Sup?
Why didn't you
tell me about Jesse?
Did Nick tell you?
Wow, you really don't
make things easy, huh?
No, no, it was your cousin--
sister/cousin Sarah,
She called worried.
She--she, uh...
Assumed that we were together,
because, obviously,
you didn't
tell her what you did.
And she thought
that you'd have
shared something
like that with me.
I wanted to tell you.
I really--I tried
to tell you a lot of times.
But you didn't.
Which is fine,
that's your choice, you know?
But it just proves to me that
you were never fully all in.
That you didn't give a shit.
That the whole thing
was a fucking lie.
That's not fair.
You can't know that.
How do I not fucking know that?
You can't fucking know that,
because have you ever
given away a baby?
I'm sorry I don't have your
fearless vulnerability, Eddie.
That is not something
that I just blurt out.
I know I fucked up
with us, I know that.
And I am sorry,
and I should have told you,
but I am done.
I forgive myself.
So until you are ready
to talk to me
like an actual human being,
and not like some gambler
waltzing in here
with a full house,
then you can leave.
Here's the door.
Oh, hey, hon,
could you ask Arnie
to tell the bartender to get
that other till down here?
I want to get the hell
out of here.
What happened?
I think I fucked up.
